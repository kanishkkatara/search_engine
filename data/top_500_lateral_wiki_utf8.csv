wikipedia-1089286," Ted Sorensen  Theodore Chaikin ""Ted"" Sorensen (May 8, 1928–October 31, 2010) was an American presidential adviser, lawyer, and writer, best known as President John F. Kennedy’s special counsel, adviser, and legendary speechwriter. President Kennedy once called him his “intellectual blood bank.” Early life. Sorensen was born in Nebraska, the son of Christian A. Sorensen, a Danish American and Nebraska attorney general (1929–33), and Annis (Chaikin) Sorensen, who was of Russian Jewish descent. He graduated from Lincoln High School (1945). He earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and attended law school there, graduating first in his class. In January 1953, the 24 year-old Sorensen became the new Senator John F. Kennedy's chief legislative aide. ""The most important aide ever hired"" became a talented mimic of the senator's writing. He authored many of Kennedy's articles and speeches. Kennedy administration. Sorensen was President Kennedy's special counsel & adviser, and primary speechwriter, the role for which he is best remembered today. He was particularly famous for having helped draft the inaugural address in which Kennedy exhorted listeners to ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" This call to service is the phrase still most closely associated with the Kennedy administration. Although Sorensen played an important part in the composition of the inaugural address, ""the speech and its famous turn of phrase that everyone remembers was,"" Sorensen firmly states (counter to what the majority of authors, journalists, and other media sources have claimed), ""written by Kennedy himself."" In later years, when pressed in interviews if he wrote the phrase, Sorenson would reply tongue in cheek ""Ask not."" In the early months of the administration the scope of Sorensen's responsibilities lay within the domestic agenda; however, after the Bay of Pigs debacle Kennedy asked Sorensen to take part in foreign policy discussions as well. During the Cuban Missile Crisis Sorensen served as a member of ExComm and was named by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara as one of the ""true inner circle"" members who advised the president, the others being Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, General Maxwell D. Taylor (chairman of the Joint Chiefs), former ambassador to the Soviet Union Llewellyn Thompson, and McNamara himself. Sorensen played a critical role in drafting Kennedy's correspondence with Nikita Khrushchev and worked on Kennedy's first address to the nation about the crisis on October 22. Sorensen was devastated by Kennedy's assassination, which he called ""the most deeply traumatic experience of my life . . . I had never considered a future without him."" He later quoted a poem that he said summed up how he felt: ""How could you leave us, how could you die? We are sheep without a shepherd when the snow shuts out the sky."" He submitted a letter of resignation to President Johnson the day after the assassination but was persuaded to stay through the transition. Sorensen drafted Johnson's first address to Congress as well as the 1964 State of the Union. He officially resigned February 29, 1964, and was the first member of the Kennedy Administration to do so. Prior to his resignation, Sorensen stated his intent to write Kennedy's biography, calling it ""the book that President Kennedy had intended to write with my help after his second term."" He was not the only Kennedy aide to turn to writing; historian and special assistant Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote his Pulitzer-winning memoir ""A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House"" during the same time span. Sorensen's biography ""Kennedy"" was published in 1965 and became an international bestseller. Politics after Kennedy. Sorensen later joined the prominent U.S. law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, where he was of counsel, while still staying involved in politics. He was an important partner of Democratic campaigns and was a key adviser to Robert F. Kennedy in Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Over the next four decades, Sorensen had a prominent career as an international lawyer, advising governments around the world, as well as major international corporations. In 1970 Sorensen ran as the Democratic party's designee for the Democratic nomination for U.S. senator from New York, but was challenged in the primary election by Richard Ottinger, Paul O'Dwyer, and Max McCarthy, and came in third. In 1977 Jimmy Carter nominated him as director of Central Intelligence (CIA), but the nomination was withdrawn before a Senate vote. Sorensen’s help in explaining Ted Kennedy's Chappaquiddick incident was cited as one factor in Senate opposition to his nomination as CIA director. Sorensen in his autobiography attributed the loss of Senate support for his nomination for CIA director to his conscientious objector status as a youth, his two failed marriages, and his writing an affidavit in defense of releasing the Pentagon Papers. Sorensen was the national co-chairman for Gary Hart for the presidential election of 1984 and made several appearances on his behalf. In addition to his successful career as a lawyer, Sorensen was also a frequent spokesman for liberal ideals and ideas, writing op-eds and delivering speeches on both domestic and international subjects. For several years in the 1960s, he was an editor at the ""Saturday Review"". He was affiliated with a number of institutions, including the Council on Foreign Relations, The Century Foundation, Princeton University, and the Institute of Politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Sorensen was a board member of the International Center for Transitional Justice and an advisory board member of the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He also was chairman of the advisory board to the International Center for Ethics, Justice and Public Life at Brandeis University. Sorensen also attended meetings of the Judson Welliver Society, a bipartisan social club composed of former presidential speechwriters. In 2007 a model Democratic presidential nomination acceptance speech written by Sorensen was published in the ""Washington Monthly"". The magazine had solicited him to write the speech that he would most want the 2008 Democratic nominee to give at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, without regard to the identity of the nominee. On March 9, 2007, he spoke at an event with then-senator Barack Obama at New York City's Grand Hyatt Hotel and officially endorsed him for the presidential election in 2008. Very active in his campaign, Sorensen spoke early on and frequently about the similarities between both Senator Barack Obama's and Senator John F. Kennedy's presidential campaigns. He also provided some assistance with President Obama's 2009 Inaugural Address. Sorensen served on the advisory board of the National Security Network. Personal life. He was married to Gillian Sorensen of the United Nations Foundation, with whom he had a daughter, Juliet Sorensen. He had three sons by a previous marriage: Eric, Stephen, and Philip. His younger brother Philip C. Sorensen was a lieutenant governor of Nebraska. On February 25, 2010, he received the National Humanities Medal for 2009 in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House. He was awarded the medal for ""Advancing our understanding of modern American politics. As a speechwriter and adviser to President Kennedy, he helped craft messages and policies, and later gave us a window into the people and events that made history."" Sorensen died on October 31, 2010, following a stroke. "
wikipedia-586997," IBM Fellow  An IBM Fellow is an appointed position at IBM made by IBM’s CEO. Typically only 4 to 9 IBM Fellows are appointed each year in May or June. It is the highest honor a scientist, engineer, or programmer at IBM can achieve.  The IBM Fellows program was founded in 1962 by Thomas J. Watson, Jr., as a way to promote creativity among the company’s “most exceptional” technical professionals. The first appointments were made in 1963. The criteria for appointment are stringent and take into account only the most significant technical achievements. In addition to a history of extraordinary accomplishments, candidates must also be considered to have the potential to make continued contributions. Francis E. Hamilton is believed to be the first IBM Fellow, appointed in 1963 for amongst other things his work on the development of the IBM 650. IBM Fellows are given broad latitude to identify and pursue projects in their area of expertise. As of 2013, only 246 IBMers have earned the IBM Fellow distinction, and 85 of them remain active IBM employees. IBM Fellows have generated nearly 7,500 patents, received five Nobel prizes, thousands of government and professional citations and have a massive store of published research in scientific journals. The IBM Technical Community numbers over 200,000 people, including over 600 IBM Distinguished Engineers – out of a total of 433,000 employees. List of IBM Fellows. In chronological order, as of 2013, incomplete: References. The Corporate Technical Recognition Event (CTRE) commemorative book for each year lists the IBM Fellows designated in that year. In 2009, a similar Corporate Technical Recognition (CTR) book was published, but there was no CTRE. The following have been used to verify the names and dates for those years in the list above: "
wikipedia-2298743," Apax Partners  Apax Partners LLP is an UK-based private equity and venture capital firm, headquartered in London, England. The company also operates out of eight other offices in New York, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Tel Aviv, Madrid, Stockholm, Milan and Munich. The firm, including its various predecessors, have raised approximately $35 billion (USD) dating back to 1969. Apax Partners is one of the oldest and largest private equity firms operating on an international basis, ranked the seventh largest private equity firm globally. Apax invests exclusively in certain business sectors including: telecommunications, information technology, retail and consumer products, media, healthcare and financial and business services. As of the end of 2007, Apax had invested in approximately 340 companies in all stages of development. Apax raises capital for its investment funds through institutional investors including corporate and public pension funds, university and college endowments, foundations and fund of funds. One of the firm's co-founders, Alan Patricof, was an early investor in Apple Computer and America Online (AOL). History. Apax Partners Worldwide is the product of the combination of three firms: Patricof & Co. and MMG. In 1969, Alan Patricof founded Patricof & Co. a firm dedicated to making investments in ""development capital"" later known as ""venture capital,"" primarily in small early-stage companies. Patricof, one of the early venture capitalists, was involved in the development of numerous major companies including America Online, Office Depot, Cadence Design Systems, Apple Computer and FORE Systems. In 1975, Patricof launched 53rd Street Ventures, a $10 million vehicle. Meanwhile, in 1972, Sir Ronald Cohen and Maurice Tchénio, along with two other partners, founded Multinational Management Group (MMG) with offices in London, Paris, and Chicago. MMG initially was established as an advisory firm, working with small emerging companies, rather than an investment firm. However, MMG initially struggled to gain traction amid the negative economic conditions, particularly in the UK in the mid-1970s. By 1977, two of the original four founding partners had left MMG, leaving Cohen and Tchénio in need of a partner to help rejuvenate their firm. In that year, Cohen approached Alan Patricof to join them and run the new firm's investments in the U.S. The new firm would be known as Alan Patricof Associates (APA) and ultimately come to be known as Apax Partners (based on a play on Patricof's name: Alan Patricof Associates Cross (x) Border). Following the merger, MMG abandoned its advising business, and the new APA shifted its focus exclusively to investing in start-up companies. Apax in the 1980s, 1990s and the 21st century. Throughout the 1980s, the firm grew steadily raising capital under a series of separate funds. As the 1980s progressed, the firm introduced its first later stage venture fund in 1984, its first growth capital fund in 1987 and its first dedicated European leveraged buyout fund MMG Patricof European Buy-In Fund in 1989. In response to the changing conditions, in the venture capital industry in the 1980s Apax (and other early venture capital firms including Warburg Pincus and J.H. Whitney & Company) began to transition away from venture capital toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments, which were in vogue in that decade. This trend was more prevalent in Europe than the U.S. where Patricof preferred to continue focusing on venture investments. In 1991, Apax Partners became the official name for all of its European operations however the U.S. business still operated under the Patricof & Co. name. By the mid-1990s Apax had become one of the larger private equity firms globally. In 2000, Patricof & Co. adopted the Apax Partners branding and formalized its affiliation with its European business. The U.S. business would operate as Apax Partners, Inc. The following year, Patricof stepped back from day-to-day management of Apax Partners, Inc., the US arm of the firm to return to his original focus on making venture capital investments in small early-stage companies. In 2006, Patricof left Apax to form Greycroft Partners which focuses on small early-stage venture capital investments. Despite the closer relations between the U.S. and European teams, the firm still operated separate fund entities for each geography. The European side of the business began to pull away in terms of capital commitments, raising more than $5 billion for its 2004 vintage European fund but just $1 billion for its 2006 U.S. vintage fund. Saunders Karp & Megrue. In 2005, Apax announced it would acquire middle market leveraged buyout firm Saunders Karp & Megrue to augment its buyout business in the United States Saunders Karp, formerly based in Stamford, Connecticut, was founded in 1989 by Thomas A. Saunders III and Allan W. Karp. John Megrue, who today heads Apax's operations in the U.S., had worked as a principal at Patricof & Co. before joining Saunders Karp in 1992. Saunders Karp had received capital commitments from institutional investors including AT&T Corporation, the General Electric Pension Trust, Goldman Sachs Private Equity Group, HarbourVest Partners, JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management, New York State Common Retirement Fund and Verizon, among others.

wikipedia-406260," Environmental remediation  Environmental remediation deals with the removal of pollution or contaminants from environmental media such as soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water for the general protection of human health and the environment or from a brownfield site intended for redevelopment. Remediation is generally subject to an array of regulatory requirements, and also can be based on assessments of human health and ecological risks where no legislated standards exist or where standards are advisory. Remediation standards. In the USA the most comprehensive set of Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs) is from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9. A set of standards used in Europe exists and is often called the Dutch standards. The European Union (EU) is rapidly moving towards Europe-wide standards, although most of the industrialised nations in Europe have their own standards at present. In Canada, most standards for remediation are set by the provinces individually, but the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment provides guidance at a federal level in the form of the ""Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines"" and the ""Canada-Wide Standards|Canada-Wide Standard for Petroleum Hydrocarbons in Soil"". Site assessment. Once a site is suspected of being contaminated there is a need to assess the contamination. Often the assessment begins with preparation of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. The historical use of the site and the materials used and produced on site will guide the assessment strategy and type of sampling and chemical analysis to be done. Often nearby sites owned by the same company or which are nearby and have been reclaimed, levelled or filled are also contaminated even where the current land use seems innocuous. For example, a car park may have been levelled by using contaminated waste in the fill. Also important is to consider off site contamination of nearby sites often through decades of emissions to soil, groundwater, and air. Ceiling dust, topsoil, surface and groundwater of nearby properties should also be tested, both before and after any remediation. This is a controversial step as: Often corporations which do voluntary testing of their sites are protected from the reports to environmental agencies becoming public under Freedom of Information Acts, however a ""Freedom of Information"" inquiry will often produce other documents that are not protected or will produce references to the reports. Funding remediation. In the US there has been a mechanism for taxing polluting industries to form a Superfund to remediate abandoned sites, or to litigate to force corporations to remediate their contaminated sites. Other countries have other mechanisms and commonly sites are rezoned to ""higher"" uses such as high density housing, to give the land a higher value so that after deducting clean up costs there is still an incentive for a developer to purchase the land, clean it up, redevelop it and sell it on, often as apartments (home units). Mapping remediation. There are several tools for mapping these sites and which allow the user to view additional information. One such tool is TOXMAP, a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services [http://sis.nlm.nih.gov] of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund and Toxics Release Inventory programs. Remediation technologies. Remediation technologies are many and varied but can be categorised into ex-situ and in-situ methods. Ex-situ methods involve excavation of affected soils and subsequent treatment at the surface, In-situ methods seek to treat the contamination without removing the soils. The more traditional remediation approach (used almost exclusively on contaminated sites from the 1970s to the 1990s) consists primarily of soil excavation and disposal to landfill ""dig and dump"" and groundwater ""pump and treat"". In situ technologies include Solidification and Stabilization and have been used extensively in the USA. Thermal desorption. Thermal desorption is a technology for soil remediation. During the process a desorber volatilizes the contaminants (e.g. oil, mercury or hydrocarbon) to separate them from especially soil or sludge. After that the contaminants can either be collected or destroyed in an offgas treatment system.  Excavation or dredging. ""Excavation"" processes can be as simple as hauling the contaminated soil to a regulated landfill, but can also involve aerating the excavated material in the case of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to remediate semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) onsite. If the contamination affects a river or bay bottom, then dredging of bay mud or other silty clays containing contaminants may be conducted. Recently, ExSitu Chemical oxidation has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil. This process involves the excavation of the contaminated area into large bermed areas where they are treated using chemical oxidation methods. SEAR - surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation. Also known as Solubilization and recovery, the ""Surfactant Enhanced Aquifer Remediation"" process involves the injection of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty surfactants into the subsurface to enhance desorption and recovery of bound up otherwise recalcitrant non aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). In geologic formations that allow delivery of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty surfactants, this approach provides a cost effective and permanent solution to sites that have been previously unsuccessful utilizing other remedial approaches. This technology is also successful when utilized as the initial step in a multi faceted remedial approach utilizing SEAR then In situ Oxidation, bioremediation enhancement or soil vapor extraction (SVE). Pump and treat. ""Pump and treat"" involves pumping out contaminated groundwater with the use of a submersible or vacuum pump, and allowing the extracted groundwater to be purified by slowly proceeding through a series of vessels that contain materials designed to adsorb the contaminants from the groundwater. For petroleum-contaminated sites this material is usually activated carbon in granular form. Chemical reagents such as flocculants followed by sand filters may also be used to decrease the contamination of groundwater. Air stripping is a method that can be effective for volatile pollutants such as BTEX compounds found in gasoline. For most biodegradable materials like BTEX, MTBE and most hydrocarbons, bioreactors can be used to clean the contaminated water to non-detectable levels. With fluidized bed bioreactors it is possible to achieve very low discharge concentrations which will meet or exceed discharge standards for most pollutants. Depending on geology and soil type, pump and treat may be a good method to quickly reduce high concentrations of pollutants. It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption (chemistry)/desorption processes in the soil. However, pump and treat is typically not the best form of remedation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to cleanup a release with pump and treat. It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction(DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically magnesium peroxide or calium oxy-hydroxide). Solidification and stabilization. Solidification/stabilization work has a reasonably good track record but also a set off serious deficiencies related to durability of solutions and potential longterm effects. In addition CO2 emissions due to the use of cement are also becoming a major obstacle to its widespread use in solidification/stabilization projects. Stabilization/solidification (S/S) is a remediation/treatment technology that relies on the reaction between a binder and soil to stop/prevent or reduce the mobility of contaminants. Conventional S/S is an established remediation technology for contaminated soils and treatment technology for hazardous wastes in many countries in the world. However, the uptake of S/S technologies has been relatively modest, and a number of barriers have been identified including: In situ oxidation. New ""in situ oxidation"" technologies have become popular, for remediation of a wide range of soil and groundwater contaminants. Remediation by chemical oxidation involves the injection of strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone gas, potassium permanganate or persulfates. Oxygen gas or ambient air can also be injected to promote growth of aerobic bacteria which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants. One disadvantage of this approach is the possibility of decreasing anaerobic contaminant destruction natural attenuation where existing conditions enhance anaerobic bacteria which normally live in the soil prefer a reducing environment. In general though, aerobic activity is much faster than anaerobic and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted. The injection of gases into the groundwater may also cause contamination to spread faster than normal depending on the site's hydrogeology. In these cases, injections downgradient of groundwater flow may provide adequate microbial destruction of contaminants prior to exposure to surface waters or drinking water supply wells. Migration of metal contaminants must also be considered whenever modifying subsurface oxidation-reduction potential. Certain metals are more soluble in oxidizing environments while others are more mobile in reducing environments. Soil vapor extraction. ""Soil vapor extraction"" (SVE) is an effective remediation technology for soil. ""Multi Phase Extraction"" (MPE) is also an effective remediation technology when soil and groundwater are to be remediated coincidentally. SVE and MPE utilize different technologies to treat the off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated after vacuum removal of air and vapors (and VOCs) from the subsurface and include granular activated carbon (most commonly used historically), thermal and/or catalytic oxidation and vapor condensation. Generally, carbon is used for low (4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. Below is a brief summary of each technology. 1. Granular activated carbon (GAC) is used as a filter for air or water. Commonly used to filter tap water in household sinks. GAC is a highly porous adsorbent material, produced by heating organic matter, such as coal, wood and coconut shell, in the absence of air, which is then crushed into granules. Activated carbon is positively charged and therefore able to remove negative ions from the water such as organic ions, ozone, chlorine, fluorides and dissolved organic solutes by adsorption onto the activated carbon. The activated carbon must be replaced periodically as it may become saturated and unable to adsorb (i.e. reduced absorption efficiency with loading). Activated carbon is not effective in removing heavy metals. 2. Thermal oxidation (or incineration) can also be an effective remediation technology. This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of dioxins released in the atmosphere through the exhaust gases or effluent off-gas. Controlled, high temperature incineration with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks. Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream. The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream. Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration (~4,000 ppmV) influent vapor streams (which require less natural gas usage) than catalytic oxidation at ~2,000 ppmV. 3. Vapor condensation is the most effective off-gas treatment technology for high (>4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. The process involves cryogenically cooling the vapor stream to below 40 degrees C such that the VOCs condensate out of the vapor stream and into liquid form where it is collected in steel containers. The liquid form of the VOCs is referred to as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products. This recovered chemical can then be reused or recycled in a more environmentally sustainable or green manner than the alternatives described above. This technology is also known as cryogenic cooling and compression (C3-Technology). Other technologies. The treatment of environmental problems through biological means is known as ""bioremediation"" and the specific use of plants for example by using phytoremediation. Bioremediation is sometimes used in conjunction with a pump and treat system. In bioremediation, either naturally occurring or specially bred bacteria are used to consume contaminants from extracted groundwater. This is sometimes referred to as a bio-gac system. Many times the groundwater is recycled to allow for continuously flowing water and enhanced bacteria population growth. Occasionally the bacteria can build up to such a point that they can affect filtration and pumping. The vessel should then be partially drained. Care must be taken to ensure that a sharp change in the groundwater chemistry does not kill the bacteria (such as a sudden change in pH). Dual-phase extraction utilizes a soil vapor extraction system that produces a high vacuum resulting in the extraction of both contaminated vapors as well as a limited amount of contaminated groundwater. This method is somewhat inefficient due to large amount of energy required by pulling water by vacuum compared to pushing water with a submersible pump. Mycoremediation is a form of bioremediation, the process of using fungi to return an environment (usually soil) contaminated by pollutants to a less contaminated state.  In an experiment conducted in conjunction with Batelle, a major contributor in the bioremediation industry, a plot of soil contaminated with diesel oil was inoculated with mycelia of oyster mushrooms; traditional bioremediation techniques (bacteria) were used on control plots. After four weeks, more than 95% of many of the PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) had been reduced to non-toxic components in the mycelial-inoculated plots. It appears that the natural microbial community participates with the fungi to break down contaminants into carbon dioxide and water. Wood-degrading fungi are particularly effective in breaking down aromatic pollutants (toxic components of petroleum), as well as chlorinated compounds (certain persistent pesticides; Battelle, 2000). Hair mats inoculated with oyster mushrooms were successfully employed in the clean-up of the San Francisco Bay area oil spill in 2007.  The key to mycoremediation is determining the right fungal species to target a specific pollutant. Certain strains have also been reported to successfully degrade the nerve gases VX and sarin. Mycofiltration is a very similar process, using mycelial mats to filter toxic waste and microorganisms from polluted water. Community consultation and information. In preparation for any significant remediation there should be extensive community consultation. The proponent should both present information to and seek information from the community. The proponent needs to learn about ""sensitive"" (future) uses like childcare, schools, hospitals, and playgrounds as well as community concerns and interests information. Consultation should be open, on a group basis so that each member of the community is informed about issues they may not have individually thought about. An independent chairperson acceptable to both the proponent and the community should be engaged (at proponent expense if a fee is required). Minutes of meetings including questions asked and the answers to them and copies of presentations by the proponent should be available both on the internet and at a local library (even a school library) or community centre. Incremental health risk. Incremental health risk is the increased risk that a receptor (normally a human being living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of incremental health risk is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist at the same time causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking. Emissions standards. Standards are set for the levels of dust, noise, odour, emissions to air and groundwater, and discharge to sewers or waterways of all chemicals of concern or chemicals likely to be produced during the remediation by processing of the contaminants. These are compared against both natural background levels in the area and standards for areas zoned as nearby areas are zoned and against standards used in other recent remediations. Just because the emission is emanating from an area zoned industrial does not mean that in a nearby residential area there should be permitted any exceedances of the appropriate residential standards. Monitoring for compliance against each standards is critical to ensure that exceedances are detected and reported both to authorities and the local community. Enforcement is necessary to ensure that continued or significant breaches result in fines or even a jail sentence for the polluter. Penalties must be significant as otherwise fines are treated as a normal expense of doing business. Compliance must be cheaper than to have continuous breaches. Transport and emergency safety assessment. Assessment should be made of the risks of operations, transporting contaminated material, disposal of waste which may be contaminated including workers' clothes, and a formal emergency response plan should be developed. Every worker and visitor entering the site should have a safety induction personalised to their involvement with the site. Impacts of funding remediation. The rezoning is often resisted by local communities and local government because of the adverse effects on the local amenity of the remediation and the new development. The main impacts during remediation are noise, dust, odour and incremental health risk. Then there is the noise, dust and traffic of developments. Then there is the impact on local traffic, schools, playing fields, and other public facilities of the often vastly increased local population. Example of a major remediation projects. Homebush Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Homebush Bay, New South Wales, Australia has been the subject of a controversial remediation project.[http://rhodesnsw.org] In this case the proposed rezoning, remediation and redevelopment has a wealth of material available through the internet from http://rhodesnsw.org: This rezoning, remediation and redevelopment of land contaminated by Union Carbide, ICI and others also involves the remediation of a strip of dioxin contaminated sediments in Homebush Bay, New South Wales. The Homebush Bay area was home to the main events of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. The soil contamination was addressed in the Commission of Inquiry into the Lednez site formerly owned by Union Carbide, but not to the satisfaction of local community activists. The remediation of Homebush Bay is important because of its impact on the food chain which extends through benthos not only to local protected and threatened species of birds, but also to JAMBA and CAMBA protected species and species which use other Ramsar-protected wetlands. Ultimately human health is affected through the food chain. Homebush Bay has a complete fishing ban, there is a commercial fin fishing ban west of the Gladesville Bridge, and based on submissions of the remediator and NSW Waterways and EPA the complete fishing ban ought be extended to the whole of the Parramatta River west of Homebush Bay and at least as far East as the Ryde Traffic Bridge. Bakar Ex Cokeing Plant Site, Croatia. An E.U. contract for immobilization a polluted area of 20.000 m3 in BAKAR Croatia based on Solidification/Stabilization with ImmoCem is currently in progress. After 3 years of intensive research by the Croatian government the E.U. funded the immobilization project in BAKAR. The area is contaminated with large amounts of TPH, PAH and metals. For the immobilization the contractor chose to use the mix-in-plant procedure. "
wikipedia-16647091," Harish Salve  Harish Salve (हरीश साल्वे) is one of India's leading lawyers, who primarily practices at the Supreme Court of India. He also appears in various high courts and in international arbitral disputes, sometimes as a counsel and other times as an adjudicator. Salve served as the Solicitor General of India from November 1, 1999 to November 3, 2002. He succeeded Santosh Hegde, after the latter was appointed as a judge to the Supreme Court. Salve is a well-known practitioner of constitutional, commercial and taxation laws.  Early life and career. Salve qualified as a Chartered Accountant in the CA Examination, and practiced on the taxation side before qualifying as a lawyer and moving to the legal profession. He was inspired by Nani Palkhivala, an eminent tax lawyer from Bombay. Salve was later designated as a Senior Counsel by the Delhi High Court. He began his career at J. B. Dadachandji & Co first as an intern in and later as a full-time lawyer by 1980. During this time he assisted Palkivala in the Minerva Mills case (case citation: AIR 1980 SC 1789). Salve worked with former Attorney General, Soli Sorabjee from 1980–1986. He declined to be nominated for a second 3-year term due to ""personal reasons"" when his first term ended in November 2002. He later clarified that his wife was unhappy about him bringing work home and continuing to be worried as he watched the evening news.  He was appointed Amicus Curiae by the Supreme Court in cases mostly relating to the preservation of the environment. However, in 2011, he recused himself from this position during a hearing on illegal mining, on the grounds that he had previously appeared for one or more of the parties. Major cases and clients. Salve frequently represents large corporations like Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Limited in big ticket cases like the Krishna Godavari Basin gas dispute case against the latter's brother Anil Ambani's Reliance Natural Resources Limited. Salve's other noteworthy client include the Tata Group and ITC Limited whom he has represented on various matters. He has appeared for several Tata group companies, including for Ratan Tata himself in a privacy petition concerning the leakage and publication of the Niira Radia conversations which exposed an alleged politico-corporate crony capitalistic nexus, causing a huge scandal in late 2010 (see Radia tapes controversy). He appeared for ITC's famous 803 cr excise matter as well as several other matters successfully. Salve represented Vodafone in its $2.5 billion tax dispute with the Indian government. He initially lost the case in the Bombay High Court, but later won it at the Supreme Court. Salve has been extremely critical of the Indian government for passing a retrospective clarification to the Income Tax law in the 2012 Union Budget, which nullified the Supreme Court's decision. ""I think this is morally obnoxious,"" said Salve in an interview, adding ""This is waging war on foreign investment. If a client asked me ‘should I invest in India today?’ I would say ‘no’."" Salve appeared for Bilkis Bano, a victim of the Gujarat Riots, at the behest of the National Human Rights Commission in 2003. In 2009, ""India Today"" magazine ranked him the 18th most powerful person in the country. He counts Subhash Chandra of Zee Network and Naresh Goyal of Jet Airways amongst his close friends. Controversies. Salve has attracted a fair share of controversy after his resignation as Solicitor General of India, perhaps because he has managed to stake an appearance in nearly every big case (measured either by pecuniary value or sheer public/media interest) over the last decade. Although he has a very successful track record, he has suffered a few blows to his reputation. In September 2009, Salve initiated a motion of contempt against Prashant Bhushan for an interview the latter gave in which he alleged corruption in the higher judiciary, particularly amongst former Chief Justices of India. Salve was made amicus curiae in the case. Bhushan later objected to Salve appearing as amicus in the case, citing a conflict in him being able to assist the court objectively. In February 2009, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), an activist group, represented by lawyer Kamini Jaiswal, alleged that Salve was not fit to be amicus curiae in the Gujarat Riots cases due to his indifferent attitude to their complaints of a shoddy investigation by the special team. In 2011, an article in ""Tehelka"" claimed that Salve was misusing his position as amicus curiae in the Gujarat Riots case, by simultaneously lobbying for companies with state government officials, who were part of the investigation he was overseeing for the court. The magazine's correspondent made allegations: ""Can the renowned lawyer do justice to the 2002 Gujarat riot victims while referring business deals to the Narendra Modi government? Ashish Khetan has the evidence of impropriety and conflict of interest"". Later, in an interview to Khetan, Salve, while not denying any of the article's factual assertions, rejected any possibility of a quid pro quo or conflict in his role as an amicus in the case. ""I am appearing against Narendra Modi and his government’s misdeeds. I’m not appearing against Gujarat. If a project is good for Gujarat I will again direct it to Gujarat. If you can show that I have received one rupee from this I will leave this profession and go,"" said Salve in the interview, denying that he had any pecuniary interest in making recommendations on behalf of Eros Energy, a company promoted by London-based billionaire Kishore Lulla. Family and background. His father, N. K. P. Salve, was also chartered accountant and member of the Indian National Congress party.

wikipedia-3779347," Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta  The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) is one of the largest militant groups in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The organization claims to expose exploitation and oppression of the people of the Niger Delta and devastation of the natural environment by public-private partnerships between the Federal Government of Nigeria and corporations involved in the production of oil in the Niger Delta. ""The Economist"" has described the organization as one that ""portrays itself as political organisation that wants a greater share of Nigeria’s oil revenues to go to the impoverished region that sits atop the oil. In fact, it is more of an umbrella organisation for several armed groups, which it sometimes pays in cash or guns to launch attacks."" MEND has been linked to attacks on petroleum operations in Nigeria as part of the Conflict in the Niger Delta, engaging in actions including sabotage, theft, property destruction, guerrilla warfare, and kidnapping. MEND's stated goals are to localize control of Nigeria's oil and to secure reparations from the federal government for pollution caused by the oil industry. In an interview with one of the group's leaders, who used the alias Major-General Godswill Tamuno, the BBC reported that MEND was fighting for ""total control"" of the Niger Delta's oil wealth, saying local people had not gained from the riches under the ground and the region's creeks and swamps.""  In a January 2006 email, MEND warned the oil industry, ""It must be clear that the Nigerian government cannot protect your workers or assets. Leave our land while you can or die in it... Our aim is to totally destroy the capacity of the Nigerian government to export oil."" Additionally MEND has called upon President Olusegun Obasanjo to free two jailed Ijaw leaders — Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, who is jailed and charged with treason, and Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a former governor of Bayelsa State convicted of corruption. Obasanjo's successor, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua authorised the release of Dokubo-Asari and Alamieyeseigha in 2007. Origins and context. For the roughly fifty years since Nigeria declared independence from British colonial rule, oil has been produced in Nigeria. Throughout this period, corporate politics has intersected with successive dictatorships. Under these dictatorships the Nigerian government has signed laws that appropriated oil resources and placed these under the control of multinational oil companies, such as Chevron Corporation and most notoriously, Royal Dutch Shell. From the point of view of MEND, and its supporters, the people of the Niger Delta have suffered an unprecedented degradation of their environment due to unchecked pollution produced by the oil industry. As a result of this policy of dispossessing people from their lands in favor of foreign oil interests, within a single generation, many now have no ability to fish or farm. People living in the Niger Delta have found themselves in a situation where their government and the international oil companies own all the oil under their feet, the revenues of which are rarely seen by the people who are suffering from the consequences of it. Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, has said of the situation, """"The oil companies can't pretend they don't know what's happening all around them. The Nigerian government obviously has the primary responsibility to stop human rights abuse. But the oil companies are directly benefiting from these crude attempts to suppress dissent, and that means they have a duty to try and stop it."""" Eghare W.O. Ojhogar, chief of the Ugborodo community, said: """"It is like paradise and hell. They have everything. We have nothing... If we protest, they send soldiers."""" Over the last twenty years various political movements and activists have emerged in opposition to the perceived injustices perpetrated upon the people of the Niger Delta by the government and the oil companies. These were usually nonviolent; Ken Saro-Wiwa was the most famous activist. Saro-Wiwa was an Ogoni poet-turned-activist who was executed by the Nigerian government in 1995 on what many believe to be deliberately false charges with the aim of silencing his vocal opposition to the oil interests in Nigeria. In Saro-Wiwa's footsteps came others who, having seen the government's reaction to nonviolent activism, advocated violence as resistance to what they regarded as the enslavement of their people. Militants in the delta enjoy widespread support among the region's approximately 20 million people, most of whom live in poverty despite the enormous wealth generated in the oil-rich region. Following a string of Boko Haram bombings in Nigeria in the 2010s, and many attacks against Christian targets, MEND threatened to bomb mosques and assassinate Muslim clerics. MEND spokesman Jomo Gbomo said a campaign will start on 31 May ""to save Christianity in Nigeria from annihilation. The bombings of mosques, haj camps, Islamic institutions, large congregations in Islamic events and assassinations of clerics that propagate doctrines of hate will form the core mission of this crusade."" However, Operation Barbarossa would be called off if Christian organisations and the Henry Okah intervene; it further called on Boko Haram to stop attacking Christians and churches. It then announced a suspension of the plans after calls from religious groups and prominent citizens such as Henry Okah. Constituency and organization. MEND is closely connected with Asari's Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force, a rebel group with similar aims. MEND reportedly seeks ""a union of all relevant militant groups in the Niger Delta."" However, the identity of MEND is somewhat obscure since its leaders like to remain faceless and its cause has been taken up by completely unrelated groups inspired by the original MEND, one of which is claiming responsibility for some of the violence that has occurred. However, the original members of MEND (recognized as MEND by the United States government and Chevron security), have claimed that impostors are causing some of the violence that is now occurring. MEND's evolving approach to conducting warfare has been described as ""open source"", so called because it is analogous to the decentralized communal development process now prevalent in the software industry, making it extremely quick to innovate and move new technologies and tactics rapidly from cell to cell without the direction of a vulnerable leadership hierarchy. Former United States Air Force ""counter-terrorism"" officer, technology analyst, and software entrepreneur, John Robb, in a Wired Magazine interview about the emergence of ""open source guerrillas"", alleged that MEND ""doesn’t even field its own guerillas. They hire their experts and fighters mostly from criminal gangs and tribal warrior cults to do their operations.""  Tactics. MEND's attacks involve substantially more sophisticated tactics than those of previous militant groups in the Niger Delta. MEND's recent tactics have included: The militants have repeatedly bombed pipelines, triggering an international increase in the cost of oil. They have also kidnapped foreign oil workers. Timeline of activities. 2006. Nine officials for the Italian petrol company Eni SpA were killed when armed members of MEND attacked Eni SpA's security forces in Port Harcourt. MEND militants briefly occupied and robbed a bank near the Eni SpA base, leaving at about 3:30 p.m, about an hour after they showed up. A company official stated, ""Eni has temporarily evacuated staff and contractors from the area of the base affected by the incident and the situation is currently under control."" MEND issued a statement regarding the oil workers: ""Be assured therefore that the hostages in return, will remain our guests... the hostages are in good health and have adapted fairly well to the conditions under which the people of the Niger Delta have been kept."" On May 10, 2006, an executive with the United States-based oil company Baker Hughes was shot and killed in the south-eastern city of Port Harcourt. At the time of the shooting, it was not immediately known if MEND had any involvement or not. Witnesses say the attacker appeared to be specifically targeting the US executive. On June 2, 2006 a Norwegian rig offshore Nigeria was attacked and 16 crew members were kidnapped. According to the news agency Reuters, MEND has not taken responsibility for this attack. On August 20, 2006, 10 MEND members were killed by the Nigerian military. The members were working on releasing a Royal Dutch Shell hostage. In an email to REUTERS, MEND stated, ""Our response to Sunday's killings will come at our time, but for certain it will not go unpunished."" On October 2, 2006, 10 Nigerian soldiers were killed off the shore of the Niger Delta in their patrol boat by a MEND mortar shell. Earlier that day a Nigerian/Royal Dutch Shell convoy was attacked in the Port Harcourt region resulting in some people being wounded.

The hostages were released less than 24 hours later, stating they had intended to destroy the vessel and did not want more hostages. 23 May 7 hostages were taken from a pipelay barge of Nimbe area of Bayelsa they were released 23 days later. they included Brittins Americans and one South African. On May 8, 2007, three major oil pipelines (one in Brass and two in the Akasa area) were attacked, shutting down oil production and cutting power to a facility run by Italian oil company Agip, part of the ENI energy group. An e-mail statement from a MEND spokesperson said, ""Fighters of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) attacked and destroyed three major pipelines in Bayelsa state... We will continue indefinitely with attacks on all pipelines, platforms and support vessels."" On September 23, 2007, a MEND spokesperson named Jomo Gbomo announced, through a communiqué to the Philadelphia Independent Media Center, that media reports of his arrest and detention were false; and then further informed, through the letter, that MEND had officially declared war, effective 12 midnight, September 23, 2007, and that they would be commencing ""attacks on installations and abduction of expatriates."" On November 13, 2007, MEND militants attacked Cameroonian soldiers on the disputed Bakassi peninsula, killing more than 20 soldiers; three days after this incident, a southern Cameroonian rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack. 2008.

On June 20, 2008, MEND naval forces attacked the Shell-operated Bonga oil platform, shutting down 10% of Nigeria's oil production in one fell swoop. The oil platform, Shell's flagship project in the area capable of extracting a massive of oil a day, was widely assumed to be outside the reach of the militants due to its location 120 km off-shore. This attack has demonstrated a level of prowess and sophistication never before seen by the rebels and it is now known that all of Nigeria's oil platforms are within range of MEND attack. On September 14, 2008, MEND inaugurated Operation Hurricane Barbarossa with an ongoing string of militant attacks to bring down the oil industry in Rivers State. In September 2008, MEND released a statement proclaiming that their militants had launched an ""oil war"" throughout the Niger Delta against both pipelines and oil production facilities, and the Nigerian soldiers that protect them. In the statement MEND claimed to have killed 22 Nigerian soldiers in one attack against a Chevron-owned oil platform. The Nigerian government confirmed that their troops were attacked in numerous locations, but said that all assaults were repelled with the infliction of heavy casualties on the militants. On September 27, a week after declaring an oil war and destroying several significant oil production and transportation hubs in the delta, the group declared a ceasefire until ""further notice"" upon the intervention of Ijaw and other elders in the region. 2009. MEND called off its ceasefire on January 30, 2009.

On May 15, 2009, a military operation undertaken by a Joint Task Force (JTF) began against MEND. It came in response to the kidnapping of Nigerian soldiers and foreign sailors in the Delta region. Thousands of Nigerians have fled their villages and hundreds of people may be dead because of the offensive. MEND has claimed responsibility for pipeline attacks on June 18–21 on three oil installations belonging to Royal Dutch Shell in the Niger Delta. In a campaign labeled by the group as ""Hurricane Piper Alpha"", Chevron was also warned that it would ""pay a price"" for allowing the Nigerian military use of an oil company airstrip.

wikipedia-1940781," The Blunder Years  ""The Blunder Years"" is the fifth episode of ""The Simpsons""’ thirteenth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 9, 2001. The episode sees Homer, after being hypnotized by the hypnotist Mesmerino while having dinner at the restaurant Pimento Grove, reminded by a repressed traumatic experience from his childhood. The Simpsons set out to find the corpse that triggered Homer's psychological trauma, which evolves into a murder mystery later in the episode. The episode was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham while Steven Dean Moore served as the director. The original idea for the episode came from current show runner Al Jean, which involved the murder mystery in the episode. The writers then incorporated Homer's flashbacks, at which point the episode was titled ""The Blunder Years"", a parody on the television show ""The Wonder Years"". Following the release of ""The Simpsons""' thirteenth season on DVD and Blu-ray, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Plot. After tricking his wife Marge into believing that the model for the Burly paper towel corporation Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. Mesmerino attempts to hypnotize him back into reality, but Homer still keeps on screaming. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are hiking in the woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe. Upon noticing that his bar was empty, the present-day Moe arrives at the Simpsons' home and begins to recall the events of that day. Moe remembers that while they sat by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. Though Homer admits that he remembers falling into the mud, he also recalls that there was no water in the quarry because something was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, all the water came out and he finds a rotting corpse on top of his legs, causing him to scream incessantly. Since Homer never told about his painful memory of the corpse to anyone, the Simpsons realise that corpse is still in the old quarry and decide to investigate. They go to the old quarry where they meet Chief Wiggum, who comes with them. Marge uses Burly paper towels to drain the water from the quarry. Then, they find the body, now a skeleton, and go into the inlet pipe to see where the body came from. They find that the pipe leads to a hatch which, in turn, leads to Mr. Burns's office in the nuclear power plant. They confront him about the body after he accidentally says 'corpse hatch' once they opened the hatch. Knowing that this would come, Burns confesses to them that the dead man is Smithers' father, Waylon Smithers Senior. However, Burns swore that he did not murder him, and to prove his point, he shows an old surveillance tape, filmed during the imminent meltdown in which Smithers' father goes into an unstable reactor core to prevent the meltdown. Smither's father succeeds in saving the city, but he dies of radiation poisoning, leaving Burns to raise Smithers as his own son out of empathy. Burns tells the Simpsons and Wiggum that he dumped Smithers Sr.'s body into the sewer pipe 'since cover ups were all the rage back then', and that he kept the truth from Waylon Jr. because he was an infant back then; Smithers then enters the room, having heard the entire story. Burns apologizes to Smithers for lying to him, saying he wanted to spare him from the trauma of his father's real death. However, Smithers admits that he is glad that his father died as a real hero rather than being killed from a tribe of savage Amazon women, which Burns told him earlier. Declaring the case of the haunted quarry solved, Homer stores the skull in his ""Memories"" box, despite Marge's insistence to give it to Smithers, to which Homer responds that Smithers will just bury it again. Production. ""The Blunder Years"" was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 9, 2001. Although the episode was written by Maxtone-Graham, the original idea for the episode, which involved Homer finding Smithers' father's corpse, was conceived by writer and current show runner Al Jean. At that point, the episode was titled ""Smithers' Father's Apparent Murder"" until the writers incorporated flashbacks to Homer's childhood that resembled the story of the film ""Stand By Me"", based on the novella ""The Body"" by Stephen King. At this point, the writers changed the episode title to ""The Blunder Years"". Homer's first flashback shows a clip of him falling down Springfield Gorge on a skateboard, a scene taken from the episode ""Bart the Daredevil"". The ""Simpsons""' staff were concerned that this would make people think the episode was in fact a clip show, so they kept the clip short. The staff also debated how horrific Smithers' father's corpse would look. The first design was ""more horrific"" than the one seen in the episode, and it more closely resembled Smithers. The corpse seen in the episode was an altered version of the first design. The video recorded by Mr. Burns' security camera was originally supposed to be shot in the same angle as a real security camera, but according to director Steven Dean Moore, to follow the narrative, the staff ""had to lose camera angle"". This led to some confusion, since one of the shots were from inside the core, making it look as if the security camera was actually inside it. The staff intended to cut the shot, but they later decided to keep it in; Jean explained in the DVD audio commentary for the episode that ""Nobody ever notices it"". The end of the episode originally had Chad Sexington showing up for his date with Marge, causing Homer to scream uncontrollably again; however, it was cut in favor of Hank Azaria's improvisation as Moe, which, according to ""Simpsons"" writer Carolyn Omine, was Azaria's ""favorite thing had ever done"" on ""The Simpsons"". American actor and director Paul Newman guest starred as himself in the episode, however he had only one line of dialogue. Newman recorded approximately five or six takes of his line over the phone from the set of a movie he was shooting at the time. According to Maxtone-Graham, Newman recorded his line with no rigmarole; ""He just said, 'Sure, I'll do it', and he did it instantly."" The episode also features Joe Mantegna, who plays a young Fat Tony. Welsh singer-songwriter Judith Owen, wife of ""Simpsons""' cast member Harry Shearer, also makes an appearance in the episode. Cultural references. The episode's title is a reference to the television show ""The Wonder Years"". Homer's flashbacks to his childhood were based on the plot of the film ""Stand By Me"", which in turn is based on Stephen King's novella ""The Body"". However, the scenes in the quarry were based on the coming of age film ""Breaking Away"", directed by Peter Yates. Burly, the brand of paper towels featured in the episode, is based on the real brand Brawny Paper Towels. The model for Burly paper towels, called Chad Sexington, was based on the Brawny paper towels' logo; however, the logo, within ""a year or two of episode"", was changed into a more ""right-of-center"" looking brunette, according to Dean Moore. One of the walls in Pimento Grove shows photos of several characters and guest stars who have appeared on ""The Simpsons"", including Birch Barlow, Stephen Hawking, and Ringo Starr. Mesmerino later reads a letter in a similarly to Carnac the Magnificent, played by Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"". Reception. Following the release of the thirteenth season of ""The Simpsons"" on DVD and Blu-ray, ""The Blunder Years"" received mixed reviews from critics. Giving the episode a positive review, Dominic von Riedermann of ""suite101"" stated that the episode was one of the season's ""comedy gems"", praising Paul Newman's guest appearance in particular. Writing for ""DVD Verdict"", Jennifer Malkowski gave a favorable review of the episode, giving a B rating and pointed at the scene in which ""Homer says finding a corpse explains everything that's gone wrong in his life—especially his fear of corpses"" as the highlight of the episode. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide was positive, calling the episode a ""reasonably amusing spoof ""Stand By Me"""". He enjoyed ""Marge's lust for Burly"" and ""Homer's rampaging fear"", and concluded by saying that, while nothing in the episode ""dazzles"", it still ""adds up to a good episode"". Ron Martin of 411mania was less enthusiastic about the episode. Calling the episode a ""bad parody of ""Stand By Me"""", Martin wrote that ""any moments this episode might have had are annulled by the constant annoyance of Homer screaming through the first half of the episode"". Writing for Project:Blu, Nate Boss was critical, specifically denouncing the episode's plot as unoriginal. He concluded his review by writing ""How crap is this? I. Don't. Know! More crap than dinner with Chad Sexington, the model for Burly towels, that's for sure."" "

Cardinal Georges Cottier, Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household and now Cardinal-Deacon of ""Santi Domenico e Sisto"" the University Church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ""Angelicum"" was influential in drafting the encyclical. The encyclical primarily treats the relationship between faith and reason. The Pope posits that faith and reason are not only compatible, but essential together. Faith without reason, he argues, leads to superstition. Reason without faith, he argues, leads to nihilism and relativism. He writes: Although reason creates a ""systematic body of knowledge,"" the Pope avers, its completeness is illusory:  Without a grounding in spiritual truth, he continues, reason has:  On the wrong turns in modern philosophy and the duty of the magisterium: In sum, the Pope ""makes this strong and insistent appeal"" that ""faith and philosophy recover the profound unity which allows them to stand in harmony with their nature without compromising their mutual autonomy. The parrhesia of faith must be matched by the boldness of reason."" "

wikipedia-7271235," Kingdom of Gwent  Gwent () was a medieval Welsh kingdom, lying between the Rivers Wye and Usk. It existed from the end of Roman rule in Britain in about the 5th century until the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century. Along with its neighbour Glywyssing, it seems to have had a great deal of cultural continuity with the earlier Silures, keeping their own courts and diocese separate from the rest of Wales until their conquest by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Although it recovered its independence after his death in 1063, Gwent was the first of the Welsh kingdoms to be overrun following the Norman conquest. History. Establishment. The area has been occupied since the Paleolithic, with Mesolithic finds at Goldcliff and evidence of growing activity throughout the Bronze and Iron Age. Gwent came into being after the Romans had left Britain, and was a successor state drawing on the culture of the pre-Roman Silures tribe and ultimately a large part of their Iron Age territories. It took its name from the ""civitas"" capital of ""Venta Silurum"", perhaps meaning ""Market of the Silures"". In the post Roman period, the territory around Venta became the successor kingdom of Guenta, later Gwent, deriving its name directly from the town through the normal sound change in the Brythonic languages from ""v"" to ""gu"". The town itself became Caerwent, ""Fort Venta"". Unlike in other Welsh territories, inhabitants of Caerwent and Caerleon retained the use of defensible Roman town walls throughout the period. Early Gwent. The medieval kingdom was traditionally taken to be the area between the Usk, the Wye, and Severn estuary. To the north, the area adjoined Ewyas and Ergyng (later known as ""Archenfield""). According to one Old Welsh genealogy, the founder of the kingdom was Caradoc Freichfras. The earliest centre of the kingdom may have been at Caerwent, the Roman administrative centre, or perhaps Caerleon, formerly a major Roman military base. Welsh saints like Dubricius, Tatheus and Cadoc Christianized the area from the 5th century onwards. According to tradition, in about the 6th century Caradoc moved his court from Caerwent to Portskewett, perhaps meaning nearby Sudbrook. Other suggestions are that Gwent was founded by Erb, possibly a descendant of Caradoc, who may have been a ruler of Ergyng east of the Black Mountains who won control of a wider area to the south. A later monarch was the Christian King Tewdrig who was mortally wounded repelling a pagan Saxon invasion. His son Meurig may have been responsible for uniting Gwent with Glywysing to the west in the 7th century, through marriage. It has been suggested that Meurig's son, Athrwys, may be the origin for King Arthur, although others consider this unlikely. At times in the 8th century, Gwent and Glywysing appear to have formed a single kingdom. Gwent may also have extended east of the River Wye into areas known as ""Cantref Coch"", which later became the Forest of Dean. Its eastern boundary later became established as the Wye, perhaps first determined by Offa of Mercia in the late 8th century, and certainly by Athelstan of England in 927. The area west of the River Usk was Gwynllŵg, which formed part of Glywysing. Morgannwg. In 931, Morgan ab Owain of Gwent, later known as Morgan Hen (Morgan the Old), was one of the Welsh rulers who submitted to Athelstan's overlordship, and attended him at court in Hereford. However, Gwent remained a distinct Welsh kingdom. In about 942, Gwent and Glywysing were again temporarily united under the name of Morgannŵg by Morgan Hen, but they were broken up again after his death. In 1034 Gwent was invaded by Canute. Destruction. Gwent's existence as a separate kingdom again temporarily ended when Gruffydd ap Llywelyn won control of the area and Morgannŵg in 1055, so extending his rule over the whole of Wales. However, after Gruffydd's death in 1063, Caradog ap Gruffudd re-established an independent kingdom in Gwent. In 1065 the area was invaded by Earl Harold of Hereford, who attempted to establish a base at Portskewett, but it was razed to the ground by Caradog, and Harold - having by then been crowned King of England - was killed at the Battle of Hastings the following year. With the Norman invasion of Britain extending westwards after 1067, Caradog's area of control moved into Deheubarth to the west, until his death in 1081. By that time most of Gwent had become firmly under Norman control. However, conflict with the Welsh continued intermittently until 1217, when William Marshal sent troops to retake the castle at Caerleon from the Welsh. The Normans divided the area, including those areas which they controlled beyond the River Usk, into the Marcher Lordships of Abergavenny, Caerleon, Monmouth, Striguil (Chepstow) and Usk. They built permanent stone castles, many originating from a network of earlier motte and bailey castles. The density of castles of this type and age is amongst the highest in Britain and certainly the rest of the Welsh Marches, with at least 25 castle sites remaining in Monmouthshire alone today. Legacy. Despite the extinction of the kingdom by 1091, the name Gwent remained in use for the area by the Welsh throughout this period and later centuries. It was traditionally divided by the forested hills of Wentwood () into ""Gwent Uwch-coed"" (""beyond the wood"") and ""Gwent Is-coed"" (""below the wood""). These terms were transliterated into English as Overwent and Netherwent, the entire area sometimes being known as ""Wentland"" or ""Gwentland"". The Marcher Lordships were the basic units of administration for the next 450 or so years, until Henry VIII passed the Laws in Wales Act 1535. This Act abolished the Marcher Lordships and established the County of Monmouthshire, combining the Lordships east of the Usk with Newport (Gwynllŵg or Wentloog) and Caerleon to the west of it. In the 19th and 20th centuries, writers again began using the name 'Gwent' in a romantic literary way to describe Monmouthshire. In the local government re-organisations of 1974/5, several new administrative areas within Wales were named after medieval kingdoms - Gwent, Dyfed, Powys, and Gwynedd. Gwent as a local government unit again ceased to exist in 1996, when replaced by the unitary local authorities of Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen, Caerphilly (which included parts of Mid Glamorgan), and Monmouthshire. The name remains as one of the preserved counties of Wales used for certain ceremonial purposes, and also survives in various titles, e.g. Gwent Police, Royal Gwent Hospital, Coleg Gwent and the Newport Gwent Dragons rugby team.

wikipedia-8969248," Royal fish  Under the law of the United Kingdom, whales and sturgeons are royal fish, and when taken become the personal property of the monarch of the United Kingdom as part of his or her royal prerogative. In England and Wales. According to William Blackstone's ""Commentaries on the Laws of England"", the ""superior excellence"" of whale and sturgeon made them uniquely suited for the monarch's use. Sir Matthew Hale added porpoise as one of the royal fish. Near the English coast they belong to the monarch immediately upon being caught, while ownership is also transferred to the monarch when a catch from any location is cast up on the shores. The kings of Denmark and the dukes of Normandy enjoyed a similar prerogative. The monarch's right to royal fish was recognized by a statute enacted during the reign of Edward II. According to Henry de Bracton, ""de balena vero sufficit . . . si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam"": the king owns the head of the whale, the queen owns the tail. In ""Moby-Dick"", Herman Melville quoted the speculations of jurist William Prynne, that the queen received the tail, in order to be supplied with whalebone for her corsets and stays (although as Melville points out, ""whalebone"" is in fact baleen, from the ""mouths"" of certain whales). If Prynne's suggestion as to the purpose of the rule is followed, the situation may be reversed when a queen regnant is the Monarch; a definitive ruling has not yet been made. Under current law, the Receiver of Wreck is the official appointed to take possession of royal fish when they arrive on English shores. The law of royal fish continues to excite some notice and occasional controversy, as evidenced when a fisherman caught and sold a sturgeon in Swansea Bay in 2004. In Scotland. In Scotland, the monarch's property right inheres in those whales too large to be pulled to land by a ""wain pulled by six oxen""; in practice, this is interpreted as requiring the whales to be over 25 feet long. Authority to collect them on behalf of the monarch is given to the Scottish Government Marine Directorate. In Ireland. In Ireland the Crown, as part of the Lordship of Ireland, also claimed the prerogative, which extended to porpoises and dolphins.There is record of a dispute between the Crown and Baron Howth c.1440 over ownership of a grampus (Risso's Dolphin) stranded on Howth peninsula in Dublin Bay, the Crown claiming it as royal fish, Lord Howth as the immemorial right of his family to every grampus and porpoise taken on the peninsula.

wikipedia-573313," Physical disability  A physical disability is any disability which limits the physical function of one or more limbs. Other physical disabilities include impairments which limit other facets of daily living, such as respiratory disorders, blindness and epilepsy. Causes of physical disabilities. Prenatal causes: Those disabilities that are acquired before birth. These may be due to diseases that have harmed the mother during pregnancy, embryonic or fetal developmental accidents or genetic disorders. Perinatal causes: Those disabilities that are acquired during birth. This could be due to prolonged lack of oxygen or the obstruction of the respiratory tract, damage to the brain during birth (due to the accidental misuse of forceps, for example) or the baby being born prematurely. Post-natal causes: Those disabilities gained after birth. They can be due to accidents, infection or other illnesses. Types of physical disabilities. Mobility impairment is a category of disability that includes people with varying types of physical disabilities. This type of disability includes upper limb disability, manual dexterity and disability in co-ordination with different organs of the body. Disability in mobility can either be a congenital or acquired with age problem. This problem could also be the consequence of some disease. People who have a broken skeletal structure also fall into this category of disability. Visual impairment is another type of physical impairment. There are hundreds of thousands of people that greatly suffer from minor to various serious vision injuries or impairments. These types of injuries can also result in some severe problems or diseases like blindness and ocular trauma. Some of the common types of vision impairments include scratched cornea, scratches on the sclera, diabetes-related eye conditions, dry eyes and corneal graft. Hearing impairment is the category of physical impairment that includes people that are completely or partially deaf. People who are only partly deaf can sometimes make use of hearing aids to improve their hearing ability. Stigma management. Individuals with physical disabilities often experience stigma concerning their physical competence and bodily appearance. This leads to impairment in social interactions and devaluation of an individual. Diane E. Taub, Elaine M. Blinde, and Kimberly R. Greer examined if involvement in sport and physical activity may help to manage stigma among people with physical disabilities. Twenty-four male college students with physical disabilities were interviewed on how they feel about involvement in physical activities. The study found that such participation in sport and physical activity helps manage stigma associated with a disabled body by demonstrating a fit, healthy, muscular, and liberated body. Thus, their involvement in sport and physical activity help them to reduce discrediting attributes toward disabled bodies. "
wikipedia-1079263," Accompong  Accompong (Acheampong) is a historical maroon village, located in the hills of St. Elizabeth Parish in Jamaica, consolidated by a treaty in 1739. It is located in one of the two areas where runaway slaves settled, originally with the Taínos, isolated enough to be safe first from the Spanish and then later from the British. The town of Accompong was named after the Maroon leader Accompong, who was the brother of a number of other Maroon leaders: Quao, Cuffy, Cudjoe, and Nanny, from an Ashanti family. History. In Accompong Town, rebel slaves and their descendants wrested land from the colonial plantation-military regime and transformed a marginal mountainous reservation, imposed by a colonial legal treaty, into a sacred landscape rooted in common land. Cudjoe (also Kojo), a leader of the Maroons, is said to have united the Maroons in their fight for autonomy under the Kindah Tree - a huge, ancient mango tree that is still standing (2009). Accompong was founded in 1739 after the Maroons signed a peace treaty with the British at nearby ""Peace Cave"". The treaty granted the Maroons their long sought autonomy. However a second Maroon war broke out in 1795. The Accompong Maroons remained neutral and the British left them alone. At the end of the war all the other Maroon settlements in Jamaica were destroyed, Accompong alone remained.  The fruitful Kindah Tree itself, with its sign proclaiming ""We are Family"", symbolizes the common kinship of the corporate creole community on its common land. In the 1990s the Myal Dance became a tourist attraction and a symbol of Jamaican nationhood, forged through a history of conflict and alliance. Culture. The inhabitants of Accompong share practices and a culture similar to their African culture originating 200–300 years ago. Every 6 January (Cudjoe's birthday) at Accompong, descendants and friends of the Maroons come together at a festival in celebration of the treaty. In 2007, the festival took on a more political flavor, as attenders protested increased bauxite mining. "

wikipedia-8242738," Languages of Denmark  The Kingdom of Denmark has only one official language, Danish, the national language of the Danish people, but there are several minority languages spoken through the territory. These include German, Faroese, and Greenlandic. A large majority (86%) of Danes also speak English as a second language; it is mandatory for Danish students to learn from the third grade in ""Folkeskole"".

wikipedia-2137952," Maiduguri  Maiduguri, also called Yerwa by its locals, is the capital and the largest city of Borno State in north-eastern Nigeria. It is popularly called ""Home of Peace"". The city sits along the seasonal Ngadda River which disappears into the ""Firki"" swamps in the areas around Lake Chad. Maiduguri was founded in 1907 as a military outpost by the British and has since grown rapidly with a population exceeding 1 million by 2007. History. The region was home to the Kanem-Bornu Empire for centuries. Maiduguri actually consists of two cities: Yerwa to the West and Old Maiduwuri to the east. Old Maiduwuri was selected by the British as their military headquarters while Yerwa was selected at approximately the same time by Shehu Abubakar Garbai of Borno to replace Kukawa as the new traditional capital of the Kanuri people. Demographics. Maiduguri is estimated to have a population of 1,197,497 by 2009 as of 2007. Its residents are mostly Muslim including Kanuri, Hausa, Shuwa, Bura, Marghi, and Fulani ethnic groups.

wikipedia-22008603," Back boiler  A back boiler is a device which is fitted to a residential heating stove or open fireplace to enable it to provide both room heat and domestic hot water or central heating. The device is a water filled heat exchanger enclosed at the rear of the burning chamber with a hot water output at the top of the chamber and a cold water feed at the bottom. Water circuit. The back boiler is typically used with a gravity feed circuit to the hot water cylinder, with a vent or overflow to prevent excess pressure build up. It can also be connected to a series of radiators to provide central heating but requires an electrical pump to be fitted to circulate the hot water. Advantages. A back boiler can improve the efficiency of a stove by acting as a heat-sink and can also act as a method of extracting additional heat from the flue system which would otherwise have been lost. Manufacturers of stoves with back boilers quote efficiency figures of up to 80% on oil-fed models. Safety. Back boilers require that the hot water or central heating system be able to disperse all of the heat captured from the fire, otherwise boiling or overheating of the water can occur. Back boilers are strictly regulated in Ireland and the UK following explosions relating to incorrectly serviced or installed back boilers. "

Some elections involve the student body, some the faculty staff, and some both. Often there is some pre-selection of candidates by the school executive. To be elected as school captain is a high honor, and the student who fills the position usually has earned particular distinction among the student body as well as among the staff. They are usually a student that has achieved a higher degree of commitment, dedication, experience, and knowledge above that of the average student. In some schools the captain is the head prefect. However, the Head Girl and Head Boy and the school captain can both exist within the same school, and where hierarchy determines that the head boy/girl is ranked higher than the school. The school captain can act as a liaison between the students at large and the faculty staff, and between the school and the community. If a student gets into trouble, it can reflect badly upon the captain. An example of a School Captain is Jack Stephens. "

Bartholomew's tenure has been characterized by inter-Orthodox cooperation, inter-Christian and inter-religious dialog, as well as by formal trips to Orthodox and Muslim countries seldom previously visited. He has exchanged numerous invitations of Church and State dignitaries. His efforts to promote religious freedom and human rights, his initiatives to advance religious tolerance among the world’s religions has been widely noted. Among his many positions, he currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute Early life and career. Bartholomew I was born in the village of Zeytinli (Άγιος Θεόδωρος) in the island of Gökçeada (Ίμβρος ""Imvros"" in Greek), son of Christos and Merope Archontónis. His secular birth name is ""Dimitrios Arhondonis"" (Δημήτριος Αρχοντώνης, Dimítrios Archontónis). He is a Turkish citizen and he belongs (ethnically) to the small remnants of the native Greek community in Turkey. Dimitrios Archontonis attended elementary school in his native Imvros and continued his secondary education in the famous Zographeion Lyceum in Istanbul. Soon afterwards, he studied Theology as an undergraduate at the Patriarchal Theological school or Halki seminary, from which he graduated with highest honours in 1961, and was immediately ordained deacon, receiving the name Bartholomew. Bartholomew fulfilled his military service in the Turkish army as a non regular officer between 1961 and 1963. From 1963 to 1968, Bartholomew pursued his postgraduate studies at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome, the Ecumenical Institute of Bossey in Switzerland and the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich in Germany. His doctoral research was on the Canon Law. The same year he became a lecturer in the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. After returning to Istanbul in 1968, he took a position at the Patriarchal Theological Seminary of Halki, where he was ordained a priest in 1969, by Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I. When Demetrius I became Ecumenical Patriarch in 1972 and established the Patriarchal Office, he selected Bartholomew as its director. On Christmas of 1973, Bartholomew became Metropolitan of Philadelphia, and was renamed as director of the patriarchal office until his enthronement as Metropolitan of Chalcedon in 1990. From March 1974 until his enthronement as Ecumenical Patriarch, he was a member of the Holy Synod as well as of many Synodical Committees.

As Ecumenical Patriarch, he has been particularly active internationally. One of his first focuses has been on rebuilding the once-persecuted Eastern Orthodox Churches of the former Eastern Bloc following the fall of Communism there in 1990. As part of this effort he has worked to strengthen ties amongst the various national Churches and Patriarchates of the Eastern Orthodox Communion. He has also continued the reconciliation dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church started by his predecessors, and initiated dialogue with other faiths, including other Christian sects, Muslims, and Jews.

The patriarchal Seminary of Halki in the Princes' Islands remains closed since 1971 on government orders. During his trip to Turkey in November 2006, Pope Benedict XVI traveled to Istanbul on the invitation of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I.

In an interview published on 19 November 2006 in the daily newspaper ""Sabah"", Bartholomew I addressed the issues of religious freedom and the then upcoming papal trip to Turkey. He also referred to the closing of the Halki seminary by saying: ""As Turkish citizens, we pay taxes. We serve in the military. We vote. As citizens we do everything. We want the same rights. But it does not happen... If Muslims want to study theology, there are 24 theology faculties. Where are we going to study?"" He also addressed the issue of his Ecumenical title and it not being accepted by the Turkish government: ""We've had this title since the 6th century... The word ecumenical has no political content. [...] This title is the only thing that I insist on. I will never renounce this title.""

Scioli has described himself as a loyal man devoted to his stable and intimate circle, and an understanding but demanding father. He is married to former model and entrepreneur Karina Rabolini and has a daughter called Lorena, who was accepted by Scioli as his daughter when she was 18 years old. Regarding this issue, he says, ""It helped me to grow and to give me peace of mind. My relation with Lorena improved my life, and that’s why now I can also enjoy Father’s Day"". Education. Scioli attended Colegio Ward’s primary school in Villa Sarmiento, where he lived until he was 17 years old.

He took part in swimming, tennis, basketball and a form of badminton, representing his city in each. His passion for offshore powerboat racing took off when a friend invited him for a ride in a powerboat. Some time later he competed in his first Offshore Powerboat race in Mar del Plata, in which he finished last.

Scioli started to compete in offshore powerboat racing in 1986 in 1987 he joined the Italian powerboat designer, builder and engineer Fabio Buzzi who ran FB Design, one of the most successful powerboat racing teams in the world. On December 4, 1989 he lost his right arm in an accident whilst racing on the Paraná river in the 1000 km Delta Argentino race.

In 1991 the Swedish company Electrolux, which had left the Argentine market on account of the country’s instability, nominated him as the agent of its brand for Argentina.  In 1994 Scioli encouraged the firm to re-establish in Argentina, an effort which gave rise to Electrolux Argentina, of which he became the director, a post he held until 1997. Political career. Scioli’s political career took off in 1997, when he decided to run for a seat in the House of Representatives on behalf of the Justicialist Party in the city of Buenos Aires. He won that election and on December 10 of that year he became a Deputy in the Argentine Congress. He was nominated president of the Sports Committee of the House for a two-year tenure, a nomination that was renewed for another two-year period on the basis of a unanimous vote.

Quotes. ""More important than to be on the left or on the right is to be at the center together with the people."" ""In Argentina we work from the government to recover values and the family"" (statement by Scioli to Pope Benedict XVI). ""I’ve got my feet on the ground, many times this is what marks my difference from some politicians"" ""I don’t like to cling to material goods. I had a beautiful motorboat and one day it turned over and sank, I had an apartment and it caught fire, I had a lot of things and lost them. My security lies in my inner strength, in my bond to the spiritual dimension"". ""I like to look toward the future with faith, hope and optimism. I think that the misfortunes and adversity I have experienced have given me poise and assurance. They have prepared me to shoulder the responsibilities I now have"" ""We have to double our efforts to generate the awareness that the family is of fundamental importance for the growth of the country"". ""We have to attain an overall recovery of the country. This goes beyond the economic aspect"". ""The Argentine woman deservedly takes up ever more space in the institutional and economic life of the country. In the Senate 40% of the seats are held by women and this shows in the quality of the debates we engage in, where economic questions are not the only important issues. Topics concerning the family, childhood and adolescence, health and education are gaining in importance"". ""To husband our soil certainly means to defend our investments in energy and agriculture. The great challenge ahead of us is to achieve that our rural areas be not only the source of foods, but of alternative and renewable energy. The encroachment of livable land on desert areas is a calamity that has a strong global impact. All of us who share this planet and its care-taking need to have a strong commitment to these principles"". "

wikipedia-2276437," Now and Zen  Now and Zen is an album by the former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant, released in 1988 (see 1988 in music) under the label Es Paranza. The album made the top 10 in both the U.S. and the UK, reaching #6 in the former, and #10 in the latter. The album was certified triple platinum by the RIAA on September 7, 2001. With a new band and a new perspective on his music, Plant returned in late 1987 with more of the sound that had previously defined him in Led Zeppelin. Although Plant continued to utilize computerized audio technology in a similar fashion to his previous solo albums, for this album Plant integrated the blues that had all but been abandoned on his most recent album ""Shaken 'n' Stirred"" (1985). A prominent guitar sound and an exotic feel to the recordings also marked another change in direction for the artist, who now added Middle Eastern tones in songs like ""Heaven Knows"". This is a direction that he would eventually follow in the 1990s with Page and Plant. The tracks ""Heaven Knows"" and ""Tall Cool One"" featured Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. (On the liner notes, Page's participation on the songs was noted with a Zoso symbol.) In response to the Beastie Boys' unauthorized sampling of some Led Zeppelin songs on their 1986 album ""Licensed to Ill"", Plant also used samples from Led Zeppelin songs (""Whole Lotta Love"", ""The Ocean"", ""Black Dog"", and ""Custard Pie"") on ""Tall Cool One"", additionally singing words from ""When the Levee Breaks"". ""Walking Towards Paradise"" was originally a bonus track available only on CD versions of the album and as the B-side of the single ""Heaven Knows"". Rhino Entertainment released a remastered edition of the album, with bonus tracks, on 3 April 2007. Plant performed ""Ship of Fools"", ""Tall Cool One"" and ""Heaven Knows"" at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert in 1988. ""Ship of Fools"" was also featured on the final two-hour episode of ""Miami Vice"" titled ""Freefall"". It is the musical accompaniment to Crockett and Tubbs return to Miami via motor yacht after rescuing General Bourbon (a thinly veiled Manuel Noriega-type character) from the fictional Central American nation of Costa Morada. In an interview he gave to ""Uncut"" magazine in 2005, Plant commented that ""by the time ""Now and Zen"" came out in '88, it looked like I was big again. It was a Top 10 album on both sides of the Atlantic. But if I listen to it now, I can hear that a lot of the songs got lost in the technology of the time.""

wikipedia-762317," Chuck Noll  Charles Henry ""Chuck"" Noll (born January 5, 1932) is a former professional American football player, assistant coach and head coach. His sole head coaching position was for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League from 1969 to 1991. Noll has more Super Bowl wins (4) than any other head coach in NFL history, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993. Biography. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Noll attended Benedictine High School where he played running back and tackle, winning All-State honors. He won a football scholarship to the University of Dayton. Noll was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in 1953, where he played until his retirement in 1959 at the age of 27. Coaching career. Assistant coaching career. Noll was an assistant coach for the American Football League's San Diego Chargers and the NFL Baltimore Colts before becoming the NFL Pittsburgh Steelers' head coach. He is considered part of Sid Gillman's coaching tree. Noll was the defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Colts (under head coach Don Shula) during their 13–1 season in 1968, in which the team set an NFL record of fewest points allowed (144). The 1968 Colts won the NFL championship by stomping the Cleveland Browns 34–0 in Cleveland, but the heavily favored Colts were shocked by the upstart AFL champion New York Jets, 16–7, in Super Bowl III at the Orange Bowl in Miami. Pittsburgh Steelers. Noll was named the 14th head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 27, 1969, after Penn State coach Joe Paterno turned down an offer for the position. Steelers owner Art Rooney would later credit Don Shula as the person that recommended Noll as a head coach. Noll implemented a defensive system in Pittsburgh that became the legendary ""Steel Curtain"" defense. His coaching style earned him the nickname of The Emperor Chaz by sports announcer Myron Cope. Noll is the only head coach to win four Super Bowls, coaching the Steelers to victory in Super Bowl IX (1975), Super Bowl X (1976), Super Bowl XIII (1979), and Super Bowl XIV (1980). The key to Noll's coaching success during this unprecedented run was the Steelers' skill in selecting outstanding players in the NFL college player draft. Noll's first round one pick was Joe Greene, a defensive tackle from North Texas State, who went on to become a perennial All-Pro and anchor the defensive line. During the next few years, the Steelers drafted quarterback Terry Bradshaw (Louisiana Tech) and running back Franco Harris (Penn State) as round one picks. In the 1974 draft, Noll and the Steelers achieved a level of drafting success never seen before or since, when they selected four future Hall of Fame players with their first five picks: wide receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth, middle linebacker Jack Lambert, and center Mike Webster. To this day, no other draft by any team has included more than two future Hall of Famers. A very meticulous coach, Noll was well-known to coach players on fundamentals in practice, such as the three-point stance, that players were already expected to know. For instance, Andy Russell, already a Pro Bowl linebacker before Noll arrived and one of the few players Noll kept after purging the roster his first year, was told by Noll that he didn't have his feet positioned right. Russell went on to become a key member for the first two Super Bowl teams and started the linebacker tradition that continues today in Pittsburgh as a result of Noll's attention to detail. While most of his contemporaries (as well as current NFL head coaches) enforced strict curfew rules on its players, Noll was very lax on off-the-field behavior. This was shown at Super Bowl IX. While Noll's counterpart — Minnesota Vikings head coach Bud Grant — strictly kept his team in their hotel rooms except for practice before the game, Noll told his team upon arriving in New Orleans to go out on Bourbon Street ""and get the partying out of your system now."" It can be argued that Noll allowing his players to go out while in New Orleans helped them be more relaxed when they played the Vikings and allowed them to win 16-6. The hallmark of the team during the 1970s was a stifling defense known as the Steel Curtain, loaded with All-Pros. The starting eleven (linemen L. C. Greenwood, Joe Greene, Ernie Holmes (later Steve Furness), Dwight White, linebackers Jack Ham, Jack Lambert, Andy Russell (later Loren Toews), defensive backs Mel Blount, J.T. Thomas, and safeties Glen Edwards (later Donnie Shell) and Mike Wagner had a collective level of talent unseen before in the NFL. The teams that won Super Bowls IX and X used a run-oriented offense, primarily featuring Franco Harris and blocking back Rocky Bleier. Over the next few years, Terry Bradshaw matured into an outstanding passer, and the teams that won Super Bowls XIII and XIV fully utilized the receiving tandem of Lynn Swann and John Stallworth. Noll was never a coach who sought a lot of media attention, and his 1970s teams were so talented that his contributions as head coach (and architect of the team) often were overlooked. In 1989, Noll finally achieved some recognition as NFL Coach of the Year, when he guided the Steelers into the second round of the playoffs. The team was not especially talented, and lost its first two regular season games by scores of 51–0 and 41–10. However, Noll did a remarkable job in keeping the team focused and steadily improving its play, as they made the playoffs and played competitively in two playoff games. Post-coaching life. Noll retired as Steelers head coach after the 1991 season with a record of 209–156–1, regular season and postseason combined. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993. His last team he coached gave him a gift of a stationary bicycle, which he still avidly uses. Noll still has a residence in suburban Pittsburgh. However, he spends most of his time at his home in Florida. His mobility has been limited by chronic back problems. Noll holds the ceremonial title of Administration Adviser in the Pittsburgh Steelers' front office, but has had no real role in the team's operations since his retirement. He spends about half the year in Pittsburgh, with his wife Marianne. They have a son named Chris who is a teacher in a private high school in Connecticut.  Legacy. Noll's legacy included providing opportunities for African Americans. Under Noll, Joe Gilliam became the league's first African American starting quarterback, just a few seasons after the AFL started Marlin Briscoe and James Harris (Gilliam started ahead of Terry Bradshaw briefly during the 1974 season). In 1975, Franco Harris became the first African American to win the Super Bowl MVP award. During the 1980s, Tony Dungy (who briefly played under Noll in the late 1970s) got his start as an NFL assistant coach, initially as the Steelers' Defensive Backs Coach and later the first African-American Coordinator in the NFL. Noll strongly promoted Dungy as a well-qualified head coaching candidate, but it did not happen with the Steelers when Noll retired after the 1991 season. However, Dungy did become head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later became the first African American coach to win a Super Bowl (XLI) with the Indianapolis Colts. On August 2, 2007, the field at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania was dedicated and renamed Chuck Noll Field in honor of the former coach. For more than 40 years the Steelers have held their summer camp at St. Vincent College, as it was Noll's idea to take the team away from the distractions in the city to prepare for the season each year. Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has admitted to checking into hotels under the alias ""Chuck Noll"". Chuck Noll was honored on October 7, 2007 at Heinz Field during the pre-game ceremonies. On September 30, 2011 Pittsburgh honored Noll by naming a new street after him. Chuck Noll Way connects North Shore Drive to West General Robinson St. The street runs along Stage AE, on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. "
wikipedia-380358," Star Wars sources and analogues  ""Star Wars"", the popular space opera saga, and cultural touchstone, is acknowledged to have been inspired by many sources. These include Hinduism, Qigong, Greek philosophy, Greek mythology, Roman history, Roman mythology, parts of the Abrahamic religions, Confucianism, Shintō, and Taoism, not to mention countless cinematic precursors. George Lucas has said that chivalry, knighthood, paladinism, and related institutions in feudal societies inspired some concepts in the ""Star Wars"" movies, most notably the Jedi Knights. The work of the mythologist Joseph Campbell, most notably his book ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"", directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of ""Star Wars"". The supernatural flow of energy known as The Force is believed to have originated from the concept of ""prana"", or ""ki/qi/chi"", ""the all-pervading vital energy of the universe"". Amongst the celebratory 30th Anniversary of ""Star Wars"", The History Channel premiered a 2-hour event covering the entire ""Star Wars"" saga entitled ""."" Featuring interviews from the likes of Stephen Colbert, Newt Gingrich, Nancy Pelosi, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Peter Jackson, acclaimed scholars, and others, the program delved further into the Heroic Epic concept and the influences of mythology, and other motifs that were important in making ""Star Wars"". Subjects include sins of the father and redeeming the father, coming of age, exiting the ordinary world, and others. Similarities. Literature. The science fiction writer Isaac Asimov stated on several occasions that George Lucas's galaxy-wide Empire bore a close resemblance to the galaxy depicted in Asimov's Foundation Series. The greatest differences are that Asimov's Galaxy contains almost no robots and no non-human aliens. Asimov addressed both issues directly in the saga's later volumes, most notably ""Foundation's Edge"" and ""Foundation and Earth"". Since Asimov's death in 1992, the ""Star Wars"" cinematic universe has gained new Asimov-esque elements: """" introduced the planet Coruscant, which bears a close resemblance to Asimov's Trantor (Coruscant technically originated from ""Heir to the Empire"" by Timothy Zahn, a ""Star Wars"" Expanded Universe novel published in 1991). In a 2005 interview, George Lucas was asked the origins of the name ""Darth Vader"", and replied: ""Darth is a variation of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it's basically Dark Father."" (Rolling Stone, June 2, 2005). ""Vader"" is the Dutch word for ""father"" (the Dutch word is instead pronounced ""vah-der""), and the German word for ""father"" (Vater) is similar. However, in the earliest scripts for ""Star Wars"", the name ""Darth Vader"" was given to a human Imperial general with no apparent relationships. Historical. The stormtroopers from the movies share a name with the Nazi stormtroopers (see also Sturmabteilung). Imperial officers' uniforms also resemble some historical German Army uniforms (see Wehrmacht) and the political and security officers of the Empire resemble the black clad SS down to the imitation silver death's head insignia on their officer's caps. World War II terms were used for names in ""Star Wars""; examples include the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces), a Chancellor as the leader, and Hoth (Hermann Hoth was a German general who served on the snow laden Eastern Front) and Tatooine (Tatouine - a province south of Tunis in Libya, roughly where Lucas filmed for the planet. Libya was a WWII arena of war). The Great Jedi Purge alludes to the events of The Holocaust, the Great Purge, the Cultural Revolution, and the Night of the Long Knives. In addition, Lucas himself has drawn parallels between Palpatine and his rise to power to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler. The final medal awarding scene in ""A New Hope"", however, references Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"". "

This marks the first appearance by any UCLA organization on the cover of the magazine. But it is usually not listed along with the other cover appearances by UCLA athletes. (As of 2006, UCLA athletes have appeared on 105 covers, the most of any university and also any sporting organization.)  In the 1960s and 1970s the band emulated the Queen's Guard.

wikipedia-13440554," The Heroic Slave  The Heroic Slave, a heartwarming Narrative of the Adventures of Madison Washington, in Pursuit of Liberty is a short piece of fiction written by famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass. When the Rochester Ladies' Anti Slavery Society asked Douglass for a short story to go in their collection, ""Autographs for Freedom"", Douglass responded with ""The Heroic Slave"". The novella, published in 1852 by John P. Jewett and Company, was Douglass' first and only published work of fiction (though he did publish several autobiographical narratives). ""The Heroic Slave"" is a fictional work inspired by Madison Washington, an enslaved cook on the brig Creole, who led a rebellion on the ship by 19 slaves in November 1841. They succeeded in taking control of the ship en route from Virginia to New Orleans, and ordered it sailed to Nassau in the Bahamas. A total of 128 slaves gained freedom there as Britain had abolished slavery in 1839.  Part I opens as Madison Washington carries a heavy load through the woods, lamenting his condition under slavery. Mr. Listwell, a free white man, secretly watches him in silence.  In Part II, the story moves ahead five years. Mr. Listwell is sitting at the table with his wife when they hear a knock at the door. Madison Washington is running from slavery, and Mr. Listwell is more than willing to help him escape. As they talk, Mr. Listwell tells Madison he remembers him from so many years before, and asks him where he has been all of this time. Madison reveals that on the day Mr. Listwell saw him, he left his wife and children to escape and seek freedom. Unable to find his way to the North, a week later he returned to his plantation. He met with his wife who regularly gave him food and provision, and for five years hid in the woods. However, a great fire caused Madison to lose his hiding place, which is why he ran to see Mr. Listwell. Mr. Listwell gives Madison a new coat and provisions and helps him escape to Canada.  In Part III, Mr. Listwell is in a tavern and reveals that he has traveled 40 miles that day. As he drinks, he sees a slave-gang on their way to market, and is surprised to see Madison Washington among the slaves. Madison reveals that he reached Canada, but he missed his wife so much that he returned to the United States to help her escape. He reached her bedroom window, but he scared her so much that he woke up her master. The couple were chased by the master and his dogs. His wife was shot down and killed, and he had been sold to traders who would take him to the Deep South. Mr. Listwell realizes there's nothing he can do for Madison in these conditions, but implores the man to put his trust in God. As he is leaving, Mr. Listwell buys 3 files; he gives them and $10 secretly to Madison. Part III ends with Madison taken aboard a ship and sailing to the South for re-sale.  In Part IV, men speak about ""unfortunate"" events that occurred aboard the ship ""Creole"". Madison Washington gained the trust of all of the overseers on board and, using the files Mr. Listwell had given him, cuts through his fetters and leads the slaves in rebellion. Nineteen slaves survived the battle. Madison declared himself captain of the ship, which sailed to Nassau. It was located in the British colony of the Bahamas, and Britain had abolished slavery in 1839. In Nassau, a group of black soldiers declared that they only protected property, and people were not property, so the nineteen slaves became free.  "

wikipedia-2288189," Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System  The Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS), known as SIMDUT, Système d'information sur les matières dangereuses utilisées au travail in French) is Canada's national workplace hazard communication standard. The key elements of the system, which came into effect on October 31, 1988, are cautionary labelling of containers of WHMIS controlled products, the provision of material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and worker education and site-specific training programs. WHMIS is an example of synchronization and cooperation amongst Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments. The coordinated approach avoided duplication, inefficiency through loss of scale and the interprovincial trade barriers that would have been created had each province and territory established its own hazard communication system. Legislative framework. The federal ""Hazardous Products Act"" and associated ""Controlled Products Regulations"", administered by the National Office of WHMIS residing in the federal Department of Health Canada, established the national standard for chemical classification and hazard communication in Canada and is the foundation for the workers' ""right-to-know"" legislation enacted in each of Canada's provinces and territories. Under the Constitution of Canada, labour legislation falls primarily under the jurisdiction of Canada's provinces and territories. The Labour Program, of the federal government Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, is the occupational health and safety (OHS) regulatory authority for the approximately 10% of workplaces designated to be under federal jurisdiction. As such, each of the thirteen federal, provincial and territorial (FPT) agencies responsible for OHS has established employer WHMIS requirements within their respective jurisdiction. These requirements place an onus on employers to ensure that controlled products used, stored or handled in the workplace are properly labelled, that material safety data sheets are made available to workers, and that workers receive education and site-specific training to ensure the safe storage, handling and use of controlled products in the workplace. Public engagement. The WHMIS initiative represents an excellent example of consensus-building public engagement. Industry, organized labour and all governments actively participated in the development of WHMIS; i.e., Canada's national workplace hazard communication system represents a consensus amongst stakeholders. The system, a shared responsibility, continues to evolve through consensus. This system of identifying Hazardous Materials is taught to students and employees working within Canada. "

wikipedia-25901656," The Windup Girl  The Windup Girl is a biopunk science fiction novel written by Paolo Bacigalupi and published in September 2009. It was named as the ninth best fiction book of 2009 by ""TIME"" magazine, and as the best science fiction book of the year in the Reference and User Services Association's 2010 Reading List. This book is a 2009 Nebula Award and a 2010 Hugo Award winner (together with China Miévilles ""The City & the City""), both for best novel. This book also won the 2010 Compton Crook Award and the 2010 Locus Award for best first novel. Setting. ""The Windup Girl"" is set in 23rd century Thailand. Global warming has raised the levels of world's oceans, carbon fuel sources have become depleted, and manually wound springs are used as energy storage devices. Biotechnology is dominant and mega corporations like AgriGen, PurCal and RedStar (called ""calorie companies"") control food production through 'genehacked' seeds, and use bioterrorism, private armies and economic hitmen to create markets for their products. Frequent catastrophes, such as deadly and widespread plagues and illness, caused by genetically modified crops and mutant pests, ravage entire populations. The natural genetic seed stock of the world's plants has been almost completely supplanted by those that are genetically engineered to be sterile. The current monarch of Thailand is a child queen. The capital city is below sea level and is protected from flooding by levees and pumps. The three most powerful men in Thailand are the Somdet Chaopraya (regent for the child queen), the chief of the Environment Ministry General Pracha, and the chief of the Trade Ministry Akkarat. Plot. Anderson Lake is an economic hitman and the AgriGen Representative in Thailand. He owns a kink-spring factory trying to mass-produce a revolutionary new model that will store gigajoules of energy. The factory is a cover for his real mission: discovering the location of the Thai seedbank. He leaves the running of the factory to his Chinese manager, Hock Seng, a refugee from the Malaysian purge of the ethnic Chinese. A businessman in his former life, Seng plots to regain his former glory even as he struggles to survive day to day as a refugee. He waits patiently for an opportunity to steal the kink-spring designs kept in Anderson's safe, and embezzles copiously. Emiko is a ""windup girl,"" (they refer to themselves as ""New People"") a humanoid GM organism used as a slave, genetically programmed to seek and obey a master. Emiko has been abandoned in Thailand by her Japanese master, and as an illegal resident in Thailand is subject to summary execution or ""mulching"" if she is caught. Raleigh, a sex club owner, gives her some measure of safety by bribing the police to let her live, but at the price of forcing her to work in his club where she is routinely abused and sexually humiliated. Among other genetic modifications, Emiko has a genetically altered pore structure which makes her skin extremely smooth but prone to overheating, a life-threatening problem in the hot climate of Thailand. One of her customers tells her of the secret seedbank and a mysterious man named Gibbons. Anderson gleans this information from her and, in return, tells her about a refuge in the north of Thailand where people of Emiko's kind live together. This becomes fixated in her mind, and from then on she strives to pay off Raleigh and escape to this refuge. Anderson's factory is destroyed by a rogue megodont (a GM elephant used to run the power train). Also destroyed are algae baths, which are critical to the manufacturing process, and whose spares are costly and must be smuggled into Thailand via dirigible. Anderson orders Hock Seng to fix up the factory as soon as possible, threatening him with the loss of his job if he doesn't do so. Hock Seng's job is made difficult by the fact that he has failed to bribe the customs officials, as he had embezzled the bribe money. Knowing that his time has come, he makes a money-for-plans deal with the Dung Lord, a gangster. Jaidee Rojjanasukchai, an upright and courageous captain of the white shirts (the armed, enforcement wing of the Environment Ministry), intercepts the dirigible containing, among other things, Anderson's much needed spare tanks, and destroys the contraband. This raises the hackles of the white, foreign trading community in Thailand and they pressure Akkarat to make Jaidee back off. To 'persuade' Jaidee, known as the Tiger of Bangkok for his ""muay thai"" skills and courage, and an icon among the white shirts, they kidnap his wife. Jaidee submits and makes a public apology. False charges are made against him and he is condemned to monkhood for 9 years. Unknown to Jaidee, his wife has already been murdered. A triumphant Anderson and his main collaborator, Richard Carlyle, negotiate with Akkarat for access to the seedbank and lowering of the trade barriers. Akkarat refuses, saying there are limits to his greed. Jaidee, determined to track his wife's murderers, escapes from the monastery and infiltrates the Trade Ministry. He is caught, killed, and his mutilated body is deposited in front of the Environment Ministry. As the white shirts revere him as a hero, they declare him a martyr, and rise up against the Trade Ministry. General Pracha appoints Lieutenant Kanya, Jaidee's protégé, as the new Captain and unleashes a reign of terror on Bangkok. Meanwhile, Mai, a child labourer in Anderson's factory, has discovered that her fellow workers are falling to a new plague that had previously made the algae tanks malfunction. She reports this to Hock Seng, who arranges to have the bodies disposed of surreptitiously. As the white shirts take control of Bangkok, he steals all of Anderson's petty cash, takes Mai with him and tries to escape. Meanwhile, through a chance encounter Anderson saved Emiko's life, and becomes infatuated with her.  Anderson discovers Hock Seng's flight and goes into hiding with Richard Carlyle. Kanya, who is Akkarat's mole, discovers the new plague and sets about trying to contain it. (We learn that years earlier Kanya had been rescued as a young girl by Akkarat when her own home village was destroyed in the course of containing a genehacked plague.) She reluctantly seeks help from Gibbons, who is revealed to be a renegade AgriGen scientist. Gibbons is a brilliant geneticist and the last hope for the Thai defense against the plagues. He easily identifies the new plague and gives clues to Kanya. Anderson and Carlyle meet with Akkarat and the Somdet Chaopraya, who is the regent to the young Thai Queen and the most powerful person in all of Thailand. Anderson offers to supply a new strain of GM rice and a private army to repel the white shirts in exchange for access to the seedbank and lowering of the trade barriers. He also introduces the Somdet Chaopraya to Emiko. When the Somdet Chaopraya's acts prove too humiliating, Emiko snaps and kills the Somdet Chaopraya, Raleigh and eight other men. Then she seeks refuge with Anderson.  Because she has killed such a powerful man and all of his bodyguards, Akkarat assumes Emiko to be a military windup and accuses General Pracha of assassinating the Somdet Chaopraya. He also proceeds to arrest Anderson and Carlyle as suspects in the assassination conspiracy. Emiko escapes in the nick of time. Kanya traces the origin of one of the plague victims to a village near Bangkok, and from information she gets there is able to identify Anderson's kink-spring factory as a possible source. She sterilizes the village with lye. Hock Seng fails to steal the kink-spring designs, so he decides to capture Emiko for ransom. He takes Mai with him.  Kanya is informed of the suspected assassination plot by her handler. Recognizing the harm the incident could cause, she visits the Japanese company that designed Emiko, learns of the true facts, and tries to explain it to Akkarat. But Akkarat has already decided to blame General Pracha for the assassination as a pretext for regime change and mobilizes his reserves to destroy Pracha and the white shirts. The capital is plunged into civil war. Anderson is released and discovers that he may have contracted the new plague. Hock Seng encounters Emiko in Anderson's apartment and holds her at gunpoint. Anderson and Carlyle arrive at the same time. They make a deal: Hock Seng would be patronized by AgriGen and Emiko would remain with Anderson. Eventually, Pracha and most of the top Environment Ministry men are killed. Akkarat, now all-powerful, appoints his spy Kanya as the chief of the Environment Ministry. He also opens up Thailand to the world, and grants AgriGen access to the seedbank. Kanya, who acts subdued at first, reneges and executes the AgriGen team in the seedbank. She then proceeds to move the seedbank to a safer place with the help of the monks. With the hidden arsenal in the seedbank, she orchestrates an uprising and coup d'état. She destroys the levees, flooding Bangkok. Bangkok's people and the capital relocate to the site of Ayutthaya, a previous Thai capital. There is now a new Tiger, a grim, unsmiling woman (Kanya), and it is implied that the Child Queen now reigns without a regent. Hock Seng is let free by Kanya to leave Bangkok with Mai to start a new life, although we never learn if they manage to escape the doomed city. Akkarat becomes a monk to atone for his failure of protecting the capital. The plague slowly kills Anderson as Emiko nurses him through the agony. She is alone in the flooded city when Gibbons arrives with his androgynous (kathoey or ""ladyboy"") companion. He promises Emiko that he will use her DNA to engineer a new race of fertile New People, thus fulfilling her dream of living with her own kind. Awards and honors.

wikipedia-9142521," Marilyn Sitzman  Marilyn Sitzman (December 14, 1939, Lafayette, Colorado – August 11, 1993, Mesquite, Texas) was a witness to the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. She was with her boss, Abraham Zapruder, as he made the Zapruder film, the most studied record of the assassination. Zapruder's clothing company, Jennifer Juniors, was one block from Dealey Plaza, through which the presidential motorcade would be passing on November 22. When Zapruder arrived at work that morning without his 8 mm movie camera, his secretary Lillian Rogers encouraged him to go home to retrieve it. Zapruder, with Sitzman his receptionist standing behind him to steady him, filmed the presidential motorcade as both were standing on a 4-foot (1.2 m) high pedestal which extends from a retaining wall that was part of the John Neely Bryan concrete pergola on the grassy knoll north of Elm Street, in Dealey Plaza. The fatal head shot struck President Kennedy as his limousine passed almost directly in front of their position, 65 feet (20 m) from the center of Elm Street. Sitzman went on record about the direction of the shots she heard, stating that they came from the direction of the Texas School Book Depository. Sitzman rejected the theory that one or more shots came from behind the 5-foot (1.5 m) high stockade fence atop the knoll: Between Sitzman and the stockade fence was a 3.3-foot (1 m) high, L-shaped concrete alcove along the path from the stairway up the knoll to the area behind the pergola. Some assassination researchers, studying vague shapes in a photograph taken by Mary Moorman from across the street just after the fatal head shot, saw the so-called ""badge man"" aiming a rifle from this area. Another person, Gordon Arnold, came forth in 1978 to claim that he had been standing in that area taking a film of the motorcade. However, in a long-forgotten interview with researcher Josiah Thompson from 1966, rediscovered in 1985, Sitzman gave eyewitness testimony to who was in the alcove below her and about nine yards (8.2 m) to her right: a young black couple was sitting on a bench, eating lunch and drinking sodas. When the shots rang out, the couple ran along the path to the area behind the pergola. Sitzman recalled hearing a soda bottle breaking as they ran. Asked if she saw anyone else in this area between the concrete wall and the stockade fence, Sitzman said no, only the couple. Sitzman attended the University of Colorado at Boulder before moving to Dallas. She died of cancer at age 53. Sitzman was portrayed by Lynne Rostochil in Oliver Stone's 1991 film ""JFK"". "
wikipedia-1426406," Hoabinhian  The term Hòa Bình culture (, in French “Culture de Hoà Bình”) was first used by French archaeologists working in Northern Vietnam to describe Holocene period archaeological assemblages excavated from rock shelters. The related English adjective ""Hoabinhian"" (French ""hoabianien"") has become a common term in the English based literature to describe stone artifact assemblages in Southeast Asia that contain flaked, cobble artifacts, dated to c. 10,000–2000 BCE. The term was originally used to refer to a specific ethnic group, restricted to a limited time period with a distinctive subsistence economy and technology. More recent work (e.g. Shoocongdej 2000) uses the term to refer to artifacts and assemblages with certain formal characteristics. Bacsonian is often regarded as a variation of the Hoabinhian industry characterized by a higher frequency of edge-grounded cobble artifacts compared to earlier Hoabinhian artifacts, dated to c. 8000–4000 BCE. History of definitions. In 1927 Madeleine Colani published some details of her nine excavations on northern Vietnamese province of Hòa Bình. As a result of her work the First Congress of Prehistorians of the Far East in 1932 agreed to define the Hoabinhian as  Despite the general terms of the definition, Colani's Hoabinhian is an elaborate typology as indicated by the 82 artefacts from Sao Dong that Colani classified into 28 types (Matthews 1966). The original typology is so complicated that most Hoabinhian sites are identified simply by the presence of sumatraliths (White & Gorman 1979). The chronology of Hoabinhian artifacts was assumed to be Holocene because of the extant fauna found in the assemblages and the absence of extinct fauna by Colani and others working before the availability of radiocarbon dating methods in the 1950s. Problems with Colani's typology were exposed by Matthews (1964) who analysed metric and technological attributes of unifacially flaked cobble artifacts from Hoabinhian levels at Sai Yok Rockshelter, Kanchanaburi Province, west-central Thailand. His aim was to determine if Hoabinhian artefact types described by Colani could be defined as clusters of constantly recurring attributes such as length, width, thickness, mass, length-width ratio and cortex amount and distribution. Matthews found that Hoabinhian types did not really exist and instead Hoabinhian artifacts reflect a continuous range of shapes and sizes. Following his archaeological excavation and surveys in Mae Hong Son Province, northwest Thailand, Chester Gorman (1970) proposed a more detailed definition as follows Gorman's work included a number of radiocarbon dates that confirmed the Holocene age of the Hoabinhian. The term was redefined in 1994 by archaeologists attending a conference held in Hanoi. At this conference Vietnamese archaeologists presented evidence of Hoabinhian artifacts dating to 17,000 years before the present. A vote was held where is was agreed that  Geographical distribution. Since the term was first used to describe assemblages from sites in Vietnam, many sites throughout mainland and island Southeast Asia have also been described as having Hoabinhian components. The apparent concentration of more than 120 Hoabinhian sites in Vietnam reflects intense research activities in this area rather the location of a centre of the prehistoric Hoabinhian activity. Archaeological sites in Terengganu, Sumatra, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia have been identified as Hoabinhian, although the quality and quantity of descriptions vary and the relative significance of the Hoabinhian component at these sites can be difficult to determine. Beyond this core area some archaeologists argue that there are isolated inventories of stone artifacts displaying Hoabinhian elements in Nepal, South China, Taiwan and Australia (Moser 2001). The Hoabinhian and plant domestication. Gorman (1971) claimed that Spirit Cave included remains of ""Prunus"" (almond), ""Terminalia"", ""Areca"" (betel), ""Vicia"" (broadbean) or ""Phaseolus"", ""Pisum"" (pea) or ""Raphia Lagenaria"" (bottle gourd), ""Trapa"" (Chinese water chestnut), ""Piper"" (pepper), ""Madhuca"" (butternut), ""Canarium"", ""Aleurites"" (candle nut), and ""Cucumis"" (a cucumber type) in layers dating to c. 9800-8500 BP. None of the recovered specimens differed from their wild phenotypes. He suggested that these may have been used as foods, condiments, stimulants, for lighting and that the leguminous plants in particular 'point to a very early use of domesticated plants' (Gorman 1969:672). He later wrote (1971:311) that 'Whether they are definitely early cultigens (see Yen n.d.:12) remains to be established... What is important, and what we can say definitely, is that the remains indicate the early, quite sophisticated use of particular species which are still culturally important in Southeast Asia.' In 1972 W.G. Solheim, as the director of the project of which Spirit Cave was part, published an article in ""Scientific American"" discussing the finds from Spirit Cave. While Solheim noted that the specimens may 'merely be wild species gathered from the surrounding countryside', he claimed that the inhabitants at Spirit Cave had 'an advanced knowledge of horticulture'. Solheim's chronological chart suggests that 'incipient agriculture' began at about 20,000 B.C. in southeast Asia. He also suggests that ceramic technology was invented at 13,000 B.C. although Spirit Cave does not have ceramics until after 6800 B.C.  Although Solheim concludes that his reconstruction is 'largely hypothetical', his overstatement of the results of Gorman's excavation has led to inflated claims of Hoabinhian agriculture. These claims have detracted from the significance of Spirit Cave as a site with well-preserved evidence of human subsistence and palaeoenvironmental conditions during the Hoabinhian. "
wikipedia-33637770," Mary Beth Harshbarger  Mary Beth Harshbarger (born February 19, 1965) is an American woman who rose to media attention when she shot her husband, Mark Harshbarger, during a hunting trip in Newfoundland, Canada. Her subsequent controversial claim that she mistook her husband to be a black bear has been subject to a lengthy investigation and trial. Biography. Harshbarger was born in Meshoppen. On June 23, 2001, she married Mark Harshbarger with whom she had two children. Shooting incident. On September 14, 2006, Mary Beth, her husband Mark and their two young children, and Mark’s brother Barry Harshbarger, were on a hunting trip outside of Buchans Junction in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The facts of the case state that Mary Beth was sitting in the back of a Chevy pickup truck with her children, armed with a rifle, on a logging road late in the day. She waited with her children while Mark and a local hunting guide walked through the nearby spruce woods in the hopes of flushing out a black bear. Barry was at a hunting blind elsewhere in the woods. Mark began to walk back toward the truck with the guide, the guide stopping to urinate in the woods. At this point Mark walked towards the van, ahead of the guide, in dark clothing without an orange hunting hat or vest to improve his visibility. At 7:55 pm (NT) As he emerged from the woods, Mary Beth told police that she saw a dark shape that she believed was a black bear, and fired using her armed rifle. What she shot was not a black bear however, but was instead her husband Mark. When he was shot, Mark Harshbarger was approximately 200 feet from the truck in which his wife Mary Beth and two children were seated. In recounting the incident to RCMP officers at the lodge where they were staying immediately after the shooting, Mary Beth said she had looked through the scope twice to make sure what she was seeing really was a bear. She insisted that she had not seen the blue of Mark Harshbarger’s pants, but instead seen the black of a bear. According to Dr. Nash Denic, the St. John’s, Newfoundland pathologist who autopsied him, Mark Harshberger died of one gunshot wound to the abdomen. Dr. Denic revealed during Mary Beth Harshberger’s trial that Mark would most likely have been leaning over when he was struck by a bullet. Trial. Following a lengthy investigation, Canadian officials issued charges in April 2008. After several years of appeals, Mary Beth Harshbarger was ordered by U.S. District Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie to surrender to the U.S. Marshals Service by 2pm on May 14, 2010. She was then extradited to Canada to stand trial for criminal negligence in the case of her husband’s shooting in 2006. Mary Beth Harshbarger arrived in Newfoundland on May 17 to face the charges. If convicted, Mary Beth faced a minimum of four years in prison. Prior to the trial, Mark Harshbarger’s father Leonard Harshbarger was quoted in the media as saying “It isn’t an accident to mistake someone for something else and kill him. That’s a negligent act, and I hope and believe justice will be served”. Mary Beth Harshbarger was tried in the Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court in Grand Falls-Windsor on a count of criminal negligence. The case was heard without a jury in the courtroom of Justice Richard LeBlanc. During the trial both Mary Beth and Harshbarger’s family responded emotionally when a video depicting Mark Harshbarger’s body was shown in the courtroom. The video showed Mark Harshbarger’s body on the ground, with a bullet hole visible on the bib of his blue denim overalls. During a re-enactment that was used as evidence by the defense during the trial, hunting guide Lambert Greene and Reg White owner of the Moosehead Lodge where the Harshbargers stayed during their trip, said what they saw through Harshbarger’s rifle scope looked more animal than human. Police who conducted two re-enactments said that all they could make out through Mary Beth’s rifle scope was a “black mass” and that it was “plausible” that she thought she was aiming at a bear. The prosecution argued that Mary Beth knew her husband was in those woods, and that it was possible he would be emerging from the site at any time, wearing dark clothing. Mary Beth was found not guilty of criminal negligence causing death in the shooting death of her husband. Justice Richard LeBlanc concluded that the Crown had failed to prove Harshbarger displayed a complete disregard for the safety of others, and that the death was “a result of an accident and nothing more”. Controversy. While Mary Beth maintained that she believed she shot at a bear and that her mistake could be attributed to her poor visibility and Mark’s dark clothing, the Harshbarger family has insisted that the shooting was deliberate. They maintain that Mary Beth is an experienced hunter and markswoman who knew exactly what she was looking at that day. There are reports that Mary Beth had increased her husband Mark’s life insurance not long before the hunting trip. Mary Beth collected on life insurance policies worth $550,000 (US). Mark Harshbarger’s family noted that despite collecting on the policies, Mary Beth failed to post her $200,000 bail. After Mark Harshbarger’s death from injuries sustained during the shooting incident, his brother Barry Harshbarger moved into the marital home that his brother had shared with Mary Beth. However, when Mary Beth Harshbarger left the home to stand trial in Canada in May 2011, Barry Harshbarger engaged in a relationship with another woman who is now his wife. Following the trial on November 1, 2011, Mark Harshbarger’s brother Barry Harshbarger obtained a temporary protection from abuse order (PFA) against Mary Beth, citing ‘I am in fear for my life’ due to her unstable behaviour and past violence. In the order Barry Harshbarger wrote that Mary Beth had threatened him by pointing a loaded rifle at him at some point prior to October 18, 2011. Court date has been set for December 2, 2011 after a rescheduling by the judge. The protection order includes Barry's father and siblings and their respective families. Barry also seeks return of 130 guns which he states are his and in Mary Beth Harshbarger's possession. After a contested hearing, the judge found that the evidence was not enough to keep the protective order in place. In Mary Beth’s defense, Dr. Denic, the pathologist that conducted an autopsy on Mark Harshbarger after his fatal accident concluded that Mark was most likely learning or hunched over when he was struck by the bullet. The issue of his posture was significant to the trial as Mary Beth had steadily maintained that she thought her husband was a black bear. Several witnesses during the trial suggested that it was too dark for any hunter to have shot with confidence. Media coverage. The shooting incident that ultimately killed Mark Harshbarger and the subsequent trial of his wife Mary Beth Harshbarger have garnered significant media interest. The story was televised by Dateline NBC under the title ""As Darkness Fell"", The Fifth Estate in a special entitled ""Til Death Do Us Part"" and Snapped on the Oxygen Network. Outdoor Canada magazine conducted an in-depth investigative report into the story in their Winter 2010 issue entitled ‘Another Fine Day Afield’. "
wikipedia-80749," Uthman ibn Affan  Uthman ibn Affan (, strict transliteration: """") (577 – 20 June 656) was one of the companions of Islamic prophet, Muhammad. He played a major role in early Islamic history as the third of the Sunni ""Rashidun"" or Rightly Guided Caliphs. Uthman was born into the Umayyad clan of Mecca, a powerful family of the Quraish tribe. He was a companion of Muhammad who assumed the role of leader (caliph) of the Muslim Empire at the age of 65 following Umar ibn al-Khattab. Under his leadership, the empire expanded into Fars in 650 (present-day Iran), some areas of Khorasan (present-day Afghanistan) in 651 and the conquest of Armenia was begun in the 640s. Some of Uthman's notable achievements were the economic reforms he introduced, and the compilation of the Qur'an into the unified, authoritative text that is known today. Early life. Uthman was born in Ta’if, which is situated on a hill, and the presumption is that he was born during the summer months, since wealthy Meccans usually spent the hot summers in the cooler climate of Ta’if. He was born into the wealthy Umayyad (Banu Umayya) clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca, seven years after Muhammad. Uthman's father, Affan, died young while travelling abroad but left a large inheritance to Uthman. Uthman followed the same profession as his father, and his business flourished, making him one of the richest men among the Qurayshi tribe. Conversion to Islam. On returning from a business trip to Syria in 611, Uthman found out that Muhammad had declared his mission. After a discussion with his friend Abu Bakr, Uthman decided to convert to Islam, and Abu Bakr took him to Muhammad to whom he declared his faith. Uthman thus became the one of the earliest converts to Islam, following Ali, Zayd, Abu Bakr and few others. His conversion to Islam angered his clan, the Banu Ummayyah, who strongly opposed Muhammad's teachings. He is said to have spent a great amount of his wealth on charity, therefore he gained the epithet """"Uthman Ghani"""", which means ""Uthman the giver"". Migration to Abyssinia. Uthman and his wife Ruqayya migrated to Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) in 614–615, along with 11 men and 11 women, all Muslims. As Uthman already had some business contacts in Abyssinia, he continued to practise his profession as a trader. He worked hard and his business soon flourished. After two years the news had spread among the Muslims in Abyssinia that the Quraysh of Mecca had accepted Islam, and that persuaded Uthman, Ruqayya and some other Muslims to return. However when they reached Mecca it transpired that the news about the Quraysh's acceptance of Islam was false. Some of the Muslims who had come from Abyssinia returned but Uthman and Ruqayya decided to stay. In Mecca Uthman had to start his business afresh, but the contacts that he had already established in Abyssinia worked in his favour and his business prospered once again. Migration to Medina. In 622, Uthman and his wife, Ruqayya, migrated to Medina. They were amongst the third batch of Muslims who migrated to Medina. On arrival in Medina, Uthman stayed with Abu Talha ibn Thabit of the Banu Najjar. After a short while, Uthman purchased a house of his own and moved there. Being one of the richest merchants of Mecca, and having amassed a considerable fortune, Uthman did not need any financial help from his Ansari brothers, as he brought all his wealth with him to Medina. In Medina, the Muslims were generally farmers and were not very interested in trade, and thus most of the trading that took place in the town was handled by the Jews. Thus, there was considerable space for the Muslims in promoting trade and Uthman took advantage of this position, soon establishing himself as a trader in Medina. He worked hard and honestly, and his business flourished, soon becoming one of the richest men in Medina. Life in Medina. In 624 some Muslims from Medina departed to assist in the capture of a Quraysh caravan. At this time Uthman's wife, Ruqayya, suffered from malaria and then caught smallpox. Uthman stayed at Medina to look after the ailing Ruqayya and did not join those who left with Muhammad. Ruqayya died during the time the Battle of Badr was being fought, and the news of the victory of Badr reached Medina as she was being buried. Because of the battle Muhammad could not attend the funeral of his daughter. After the Battle of Uhud Uthman married Muhammad's second daughter, Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad. The next year Fahida bint ghazwan's son, Abd-Allah ibn Uthman, died. When the Battle of the Trench was fought in 627, Uthman was in charge of a sector of Medina. After the battle a campaign was undertaken against the Jews of Banu Qaynuqa, and when they were taken captive the question of the disposal of the slaves became a problem. Uthman solved the issue by purchasing all the slaves and depositing their price in the ""Bayt al-mal"" (Treasury). Any of these slaves who accepted Islam were set free by Uthman in the name of Allah. When Ali married Fatimah Ali still had no money, nothing for a dowry, nothing for the customary gifts of jewels for his bride or the expenses of marriage. Fortunately Uthman stepped in at the moment. Fixed the value of Ali's newly won body armor at a generously high price, he insisted on buying it for five hundred dirhams. Four hundred could then be set aside as a dowry for Fatimah, leaving a hundred for all other expenses. Later Uthman presented the armor back to Ali as a wedding present. Treaty of Hudaibiyah. In March 628 (6 Hijri), Muhammad set out for Mecca to perform the ritual pilgrimage of Umra. The Quraysh denied the Muslims entry into the city and posted themselves outside Mecca, determined to show resistance, even though the Muslims had no intention or preparation for battle. Muhammad camped outside Mecca, at Hudaybiyyah, and sent Uthman as his envoy to meet with the leaders of Quraysh and negotiate Muslim entry into the city. The Quraysh made Uthman stay longer in Mecca than he originally planned and refused to inform the Muslims of his whereabouts. This caused the Muslims to believe that Uthman had been killed by the people of Quraysh. On this occasion, Muhammad gathered his nearly 1,400 Followers and called them to pledge to fight until death and avenge the rumoured death of Uthman, which they did by placing a hand on top of Muhammad's. It is reported that Muhammad placed one of his hands on top of the other and pledged on behalf of Uthman as well. This pledge took place under a tree and was known as the Pledge of the Tree and was successful in demonstrating to the Quraysh the determination of the Muslims. They soon released Uthman and sent down an ambassador of their own, Suhail ibn Amr to negotiate terms of a treaty that later became known as the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. Muhammad's last years. In 629 CE, Uthman fought in the Battle of Khaybar and later that year, he followed Muhammad to perform Umrah in Mecca. While in Mecca, he visited his mother and found that his family was not as hostile to Islam as they used to be. In 630 CE, the Quraysh broke the treaty of Hudaibiyah, and the Muslims attacked and conquered Mecca. General amnesty was granted to the people of the city, although an exception was made in the case of half a dozen people. Amongst those not granted amnesty was Abdullah ibn Saad, a foster brother of Uthman. Later, following an appeal by Abdullah's mother to Uthman, he was forgiven by Muhammad. Following the Conquest of Mecca Uthman's family converted to Islam and he rejoined his mother and siblings. Two weeks later, under the command of Muhammad, he participated in the Battle of Hunayn which was followed by the Siege of Ta'if. To Uthman, the conquest of Mecca and Ta’if were of particular significance, as he had considerable property in both cities, and he could now profitably develop them. He was also able to set up sub-offices for his businesses at Mecca and Ta’if. Uthman's wife, and the daughter of Muhammad, Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad, died soon after the conquest of Mecca. In 630 Muhammad decided to lead an expedition to Tabuk on the Syrian border. In order to finance the expedition Muhammad invited contributions from his followers. Uthman made the largest contribution: 1,000 dinars in cash, 1,000 camels for transport, and horses for the cavalry, which Muhammad greatly appreciated. In 631, along with other Muslims, Uthman moved to Mecca to perform Hajj under Abu Bakr while Muhammad stayed in Medina. In Mecca Uthman married Umm Saeed Fatima bint Al Walid b Abd Shams, a Qurayshi lady, and returned to Medina with her. In 632, along with Muhammad, Uthman participated in The Farewell Pilgrimage. In 632 Muhammad died. Caliph Abu Bakr's era (632–634). Uthman had a very close relationship with Abu Bakr, as it was due to him that Uthman had converted to Islam. When Abu Bakr was selected as the Caliph, Uthman was the first person after Umar to offer his allegiance. During the Ridda wars (Wars of Apostasy), Uthman remained at Medina, acting as Abu Bakr's adviser. On his deathbed, Abu Bakr dictated his will to Uthman, saying that his successor was to be Umar. Caliph Umar's era (634–644). Uthman was the first person to offer his allegiance to Umar. During the reign of Umar, Uthman remained at Medina as his adviser, and a member of his advisory council. Umar did not allow the companions, including Uthman, to leave Medina. The reason for this was that Umar didn't wish for the companions, who were famous and respected among the Muslims, to spread and have their own followers, which would, it was felt, have resulted in unnecessary divisions in Islam. During the reign of Umar, considerable wealth flowed into the public treasury. Uthman advised that some amount be reserved in the treasury for future needs, instead of giving all of it as stipends to the Muslims, and this was accepted by Umar. A controversy then arose about the land in conquered areas. The army was of the view that all lands in conquered territories should be distributed among the soldiers of the conquering army, but others thought that the lands should remain as the property of the original owners, and the lands without claimants should be declared as state property. Uthman supported the latter view and this view was ultimately accepted. At the time of the conquest of Jerusalem the Christians asked that Umar come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city. Uthman was of the view that it was not necessary for the Caliph of the Muslims to go to Jerusalem and that the enemy, when defeated, would surrender the city unconditionally. There was much force in Uthman's argument, but in order to win the good will of the Christians, Umar decided to go to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city. In the time of Umar, a severe famine broke out in the country and a large caravan belonging to Uthman that was carrying a large supply of food grains served the poor well. Election of Uthman. Umar, on his deathbed formed a committee of six people to choose the next Caliph from amongst themselves. This committee was: Umar asked that, after his death, the committee reach a final decision within three days, and the next Caliph should take the oath of office on the fourth day. If Talhah joined the committee within this period, he was to take part in the deliberations, but if he did not return to Medina within this period, the other members of the committee could proceed with the decision. Abdur Rahman bin Awf withdrew his eligibility to be appointed as Caliph in order to act as a moderator and began his task by interviewing every member of the committee separately. He asked them for whom they would cast their vote. When Ali was asked, he didn't reply. When Uthman was asked, he voted for Ali, Zubayr said for ""Ali or Uthman"". and Saad said ""for Uthman"". After Abdul Rahman consulted the other leaders of public opinion in Medina, who were in favour of Uthman, he arrived at the conclusion that the majority of the people favoured the election of Uthman. On the fourth day after the death of Umar, 11 November 644, 5 Muharram 24 Hijri, Uthman was elected as the third Caliph, with the ""title"" ""Amir al-Mu'minin"". Reign as a Caliph (644–656). On assuming office, Uthman issued a number of directives to the officials all over the dominions, ordering them to hold fast the laws made by his predecessor Umar. Uthman's realm extended in the west to Morocco, in the east to South east of present day Pakistan, and in the north to Armenia and Azerbaijan. During his caliphate, the first Islamic naval force was established, administrative divisions of the state were revised, and many public projects were expanded and completed. Uthman sent prominent sahabas (""companions of Muhammad"") as his personal deputies to various provinces to scrutinize the conduct of officials and the condition of the people. In total, Uthman ruled for twelve years. The first six years were marked by internal peace and tranquillity, and he remained the most popular Caliph among the Rashidun; but during the second half of his caliphate a rebellion arose. Uthman had the distinction of working for the expansion of Islam, and he sent the first official Muslim envoy to China in 650. The envoy, headed by Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas, arrived in the Tang capital, Chang'an, in 651 via the overseas route. The Hui people generally consider this date to be the official founding of Islam in China. ""The Ancient Record of the Tang Dynasty"" recorded the historic meeting, in which the envoy greeted Emperor Gaozong of Tang and tried to convert him to Islam. Although the envoy failed to convince the Emperor to embrace Islam, the Emperor allowed him to proselytize in China and ordered the establishment of the first Chinese mosque in the capital to show his respect for the religion. Uthman also sent official Muslim envoys to Sri Lanka. Uthman and Muawiyah. Uthman and Muawiyah were both from the Umayyad clan. In 639 Muawiyah I was appointed the Governor of Syria by Umar after his elder brother Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan (Governor of Syria) died in a plague, along with Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah the governor before him and 25,000 other people. To stop the Byzantine harassment from the sea during the Arab-Byzantine Wars, in 649 Muawiyah set up a navy; manned by Monophysitise Christians, Copts and Jacobite Syrian Christians sailors and Muslim troops. This resulted in the defeat of the Byzantine navy at the Battle of the Masts in 655, opening up the Mediterranean. Reforms of Uthman's era. Economic reforms. Uthman was a shrewd businessman and a successful trader from his youth, which contributed greatly to the Rashidun Empire. Umar had fixed the allowance of the people and on assuming office, Uthman increased it by about 25%. Umar had placed a ban on the sale of lands and the purchase of agricultural lands in conquered territories. Uthman withdrew these restrictions, in view of the fact that the trade could not flourish. Uthman also permitted people to draw loans from the public treasury. Under Umar it had been laid down as a policy that the lands in conquered territories were not to be distributed among the combatants, but were to remain the property of the previous owners. The army felt dissatisfied at this decision, but Umar suppressed the opposition with a strong hand. Uthman followed the policy devised by Umar and there were more conquests, and the revenues from land increased considerably. The army once again raised the demand for the distribution of the lands in conquered territories among the fighting soldiers but Uthman turned down the demand and it favoured the Dhimmis (non-Muslims in Islamic state). In 651, the first Islamic coins were struck during the caliphate of Uthman, these were the Persian dirhams that had an image of the Persian emperor Yazdgerd III with the addition of the Arabic sentence Bismillah (بسم الله) (""in the name of Allah""). However the first original minting of the Islamic dirham was done in 695 during Umayyad period. Umar, the predecessor of Uthman was very strict in the use of money from the public treasury. Apart from the meagre allowance that had been sanctioned in his favour, Umar took no money from the treasury. He did not receive any gifts, nor did he allow any of his family members to accept any gift from any quarter. During the time of Uthman there was some relaxation in such strictness. Uthman did not draw any allowance from the treasury for his personal use, nor did he receive a salary, he was a wealthy man with sufficient resources of his own, but unlike Umar, Uthman accepted gifts and allowed his family members to accept gifts from certain quarters. Uthman honestly felt that he had the right to utilize the public funds according to his best judgment, and no one criticized him for that. The economic reforms introduced by Uthman had far reaching effects; Muslims as well as non-Muslims of the Rashidun Empire enjoyed an economically prosperous life during his reign. Public works. Under Uthman the people became economically more prosperous, and they invested their money in the construction of buildings. Many new and larger buildings were constructed throughout the empire. During the caliphate of Uthman as many as five thousand new mosques were constructed. Uthman enlarged, extended, and embellished the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi at Medina and the Kaaba as well. With the expansion of the army, the cantonments were extended and enlarged, more barracks were constructed for the soldiers and stables for the cavalry were extended. Uthman provided separate pastures for state camels. During the caliphate of Uthman, guest houses were provided in main cities to provide comfort to the merchants coming from faraway places. More and more markets were constructed and Uthman appointed Market Officers to look after them. In Iraq, Egypt and Persia numerous canals were dug, which stimulated agricultural development. In the cities, particular attention was directed towards the provision of the water supply. In Medina, a number of wells were dug to provide drinking water for the people and in Mecca the water supply was also improved. Water was brought to Kufa and Basra by canals. Shuaibia was the port for Mecca but it was inconvenient, so Uthman selected Jeddah as the site of the new seaport, and a new port was built there. Uthman also reformed the police departments in cities. Administration. In his testament, Umar had instructed his successor not to make any change in the administrative set up for one year after his death. For one year Uthman maintained the pattern of political administration as it stood under Umar, later making some amendments. Under Umar, Egypt was divided into two provinces, Upper and Lower Egypt. Uthman made Egypt one province and created a new province for Efriqya. Under Umar, Syria was divided into two provinces but Uthman made it one province. During Uthman’s reign the empire was divided into twelve provinces. These were: The provinces were further divided into districts (more than 100 districts in the empire) and each district or main city had its own Governor, Chief judge and Amil (tax collector). The governors were appointed by Uthman and every appointment was made in writing. At the time of appointment, an instrument of instructions was issued with a view to regulating the conduct of the governors. On assuming office, the governor was required to assemble the people in the main mosque, and read the instrument of instructions before them. Kinsmen as governors. Uthman appointed his kinsmen as governors of four provinces: Egypt, Syria, Basra and Kufa. The kindest explanation for this reliance on his kin is that the Rashidun Empire had expanded so far, so fast, that it was becoming extremely difficult to govern, and that Uthman felt that he could trust his own kin not to revolt against him. However Shiah did not see this as prudence; they saw it as nepotism, and an attempt to rule like a king rather than as the first among equals. Qur'an. Uthman is perhaps best known for forming the committee which produced multiple copies of the text of the Qur'an as it exists today. The reason was that various Muslim centres, like Kufa and Damascus, had begun to develop their own traditions for reciting the Qur'an and writing it down with stylistic differences. During the time of Uthman, by which time Islam had spread far and wide, differences in reading the Quran in different dialects of Arabic language became obvious. A group of companions, headed by Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, who was then stationed in Iraq, came to Uthman and urged him to ""save the Muslim ummah before they differ about the Quran"" . Uthman obtained the complete manuscript of the Qur'an from Hafsah, one of the wives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad who had been entrusted to keep the manuscript ever since the Qur'an was comprehensively compiled by the first Caliph, Abu Bakr . Uthman then again summoned the leading compiling authority, Zayd ibn Thabit, and some other companions to make copies of the manuscript. Zayd was put in charge of the task. The style of Arabic dialect used was that of the Quraysh tribe to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged. Hence this style was emphasized over all others. Zayd and his assistants produced several copies of the manuscript of the Qur'an. One of each was sent to every Muslim province with the order that all other Quranic materials, whether fragmentary or complete copies, be destroyed. As such, when the standard copies were made widely available to the Muslim community everywhere, then all other material was burnt voluntarily by the Muslim community themselves. The annihilation of these extra-Qur'anic documents remained essential in order to eradicate scriptural incongruities, contradictions of consequence or differences in the dialect from the customary text of the Qur'an. The Caliph Uthman kept a copy for himself and returned the original manuscript to Hafsah. While Shi'a and Sunni accept the same sacred text, the Qur'an, some claim that Shi'a dispute the current version, i.e. they add two additional surahs known as al-Nurayn and al-Wilaya. Nonetheless, Shi'as claim that they are falsely accused of this, as they believe, like Sunnis, that the Qur'an has never been changed and it is with reference from sunni hadeeth books that this inference is drawn not only by uninformed shias but sunnis too. Military expansion. Islamic empire expanded at an unprecedented rate under Caliph Umar, following the death of Caliph Umar, almost whole of the former Sassanid empire's territory rebelled from time to time until 650, when the last Sassanid emperor was assassinated. Caliph Uthman thus directed several military expeditions to crush rebellion and re-capture the Persia and their vassal states. The main rebellion was in the Persian provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Fars, Sistan, Tabaristan, Khorasan, and Makran. These provinces were across present days Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, Turkmenistan and Armenia. In addition to these provinces several other territories were also subdued in the region. After the death of Caliph Umar, Byzantine emperor Constantine III launched an attack but was repulsed, due to which Uthman ordered annual raids in Anatolia to cut off the power of Byzantine. From 647 to 651 major offensives were launched in Cappadocia, Caesarea Mazaca, Cilicia and Isauria in 650–651 forced the Byzantine emperor Constans II to enter into negotiations The truce that followed made it possible for Constans II to hold on to the western portions of Armenia. A naval force was built and island of Cyprus was captured in 649 followed by the capture of Crete and Rhodes. After a naval victory against Byzantine fleet a part of Sicily was also captured. In 654–655 Uthman ordered for the preparation of an expedition to capture Constantinopole, it was about to be launched when Uthman was murdered. North Africa was invaded in 647 and Byzantine Exarchate of Africa which had declared its independence under its King Gregory the Patrician was annexed. Nubia was invaded in 652 and its capital Dongola was sacked. Though battle remained inconclusive and a peace offer from Nubian King was accepted according to which no party will any aggressive moves against each other. In 652–653 the Iberian Peninsula was invaded and its coastal areas were captured, before further expansion could be made Caliph was murdered and forces were pulled back from Iberia and north Africa during Muslim civil war. Sabaites, Qurra and the Kharijities. Islamic empire expanded at an unprecedented rate, but there was a cost associated with this high rate of expansion. Many desert nomads and some bandits living between current day Iraq and Saudi Arabia also joined in, not out of commitment to Islam, but to share the spoils and benefit from the change in the social order, after the defeat of the Persian Empire. The Qur'an and Muhammad talked about racial equality and justice as in the The Farewell Sermon. Tribal and nationalistic differences were discouraged. But after Muhammad's passing the old tribal differences between the Arabs started to resurface. Before Islam, the Roman-Persian Wars and the Byzantine–Sasanian wars had occurred every few years for hundreds of years between 69 BC and 629 AD. High taxes were imposed on the populations in both the Byzantine Roman and Sassanid Persian empires to finance these wars. There was also continuous bloodshed of the people during these wars. The Arab tribes in Iraq were paid by the Persian Sassanids to act as mercenaries. While the Arab tribes in Syria were paid by the Byzantine to act as their mercenaries. The Persians maintained an Arab satellite state of Lakhm and the Byzantine Empire maintained the Arab satellite state of Ghassan which they used to fight each other. The Syrians and the Iraqis had been fighting each other for centuries. Therefore later, each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in their area. Later others like the Lakhm Arabs, many of whom became the Qurra, also wanted to rule Persia. Sects started to form, among them the Sabaites named after Abdala Ben Saba  At-Tabri (5:66) reported that when a man called ""Abdullah ibn Saba"" came to Syria, he met Adu Dharr. He Said ""Adu Dharr, aren't you amazed at Muawiya saying, ""The property is the property of Allah. Doesn't everything belong to Allah?' It seems he means to cut it off from the Muslims and erase the name of the Muslims!"" Adu Dharr therefore went to him and said ""What leads you to call the property of the Muslims the property of Allah?"" Muawiya said ""May Allah have mercy on you, Adu Dharr! Are we not the slaves of Allah and all property is His property and all creation is His creation and all the affair is His affair?"" Abu Dharr said ""Do not say that."" Muawiya said ""I do not say that it does not belong to Allah, but I say, 'The property of the Muslims'"" Adbullah ibn Saba came back to Abu Dharr who them said to him ""Who are you? By Allah, I think that you are a Jew."" Then Ibn Saba went to Abdullah ibn as-Samit and attempted to make his discontented. 'Adbullah took him to Muawiya and said ""By Allah this is one who sent Abu Dharr to you"". There is also Jewish literature from that time, regarding Adbullah ibn Saba. Much of the Jewish literature on Adbullah ibn Saba from that time regards Adbullah ibn Saba as an apostate from Judaism and asks Jews to keep away from him. There was also the movement towards more autonomous tribal groupings which was particularly strong in Kufa, in Iraq, they wanted to rule their own states. Amongst them developed a group called the Qurra who later became known as the Kharijities. The Qurra are referenced in many Hadith from the period of Muhammad, Abu Bakr and Umar in Sahih Al Bukhari (Volume 6, Book 60, Number 201 and Volume 6, Book 61, Number 509 and Volume 8, Book 75, Number 403): The Qurra had taken part in the Battle of Yamama. But the Qurra never listened to orders and would start battles even when they were ordered not to and were heavily out numbered. At Yamamah, Khalid ibn al-Walid wrote to them and Ikrimah to just observe the forces of Musaylimah at Yamamah, and told them not to start fighting until he had arrived. Shurahbil bin Hasanah was also dispatched to assist them. But even though they were heavily out numbered, they disobeyed their orders and started a battle and as a result suffered heavy casualties. They later disobeyed orders and started the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Saffin and did the same against Ali in the Battle of Nahrawan even through they were heavily out numbered. Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 201 :  Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit Al-Ansari ""...Abu Bakr sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of qurra' were killed). 'Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said, 'Umar has come to me and said, The people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the qurra' at other battle-fields ... Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 9, Book 92, Number 386 :  Narrated by Hammam Hudhaifa said, ""O the Group of Al-qurra! Follow the straight path, for then you have taken a great lead (and will be the leaders), but if you divert right or left, then you will go astray far away."" Al-Masudi calls them the ""ahl al-qar wa l-ashraf"" The earliest reference to these people are as Ajl al-Qura, the people of the village, those who fought with Abu Bakr against the desert tribes of Yamama during the Ridda when some of the tribes refused to pay taxes. The Qurra had political and economic interests that were different from those of Ali or Muawiyah. They had served in the Ridda wars and had been granted trusteeship over some of the lands in Sawad in Iraq and were now called Ahl al Ayyam, those who had taken part in the eastern conquests. They then became known as the Qurra and received the highest stipend of the Muslim army, the sharaf al ata and they had the use of the best lands which they came to regard as their private domain. The Qurra received stipends varying between 2,000 and 3,000 dirhams, while the majority of the rest of the troops received only 250 to 300 dirhams. The other Ridda tribesmen in Kufa, in Iraq, resented the special position given to the Qurra. The tension between the Ridda tribesmen and the Qurra threatened the Qurra's newly acquired prestige. The Qurra therefore felt obliged to defend their position in the new but rapidly changing society. Uthman's policies of reducing their status threatened their interests. The Qurra were mainly based in Kufa, in Iraq. They had not been involved in Syria. But later when Uthman declined to give them more lands in Persia they felt that their status was being reduced and therefore started to cause trouble. He also removed the distinction between the Ridda and pre-Ridda tribesmen which was not to their liking and lessened their prestige. The Qurra had previously been desert nomads and some were also bandits and had joined to Muslims so that they could gain lands and status and become the new aristocrats in Iraq Some of the people with their tribal names as Qurra had been expelled from Kufa, in Iraq, for fomenting trouble and were sent to Muawiyah in Syria. Muawiyah then said to them: ""You are people from the Arabs. You have importance and are heard. You have obtained nobility by Islam. You have conquered the nations and you have won their positions and their inheritance. I have heard that you resent the Quraysh. If it had not been for the Quraysh, you would have been considered abased as you were before, However, they are still your Imams today and your shelter, so do not impede your shelter. Your Imamns are patient with you in the face of your injustice and endure the trouble that you cause. By Allah, either you will cease or Allah will try you with someone who will be hard on you. Then you will share with them in what you brough about on the populace while you were alive and after your death. "" The Qurra Arabs had previously been desert nomads and bandits. One of them then spoke with great arrogance and said to Muawiyah ""How much you go on about authority and the Quraysh! The Arabs (meaning they the Qurra) were eating from the hilts of their swords while the Quraysh were nothing but merchants!"" He then said ""As for the shelter you mentioned, when the shelter is pierced, then come to us"" meaning that they will remove the Quraysh and will rule them selves. Muawiyah then said to him ""I remind you by Islam and yet you mention the Jahiliyya (meaning their days before Islam)"" Muawiyah then wrote to Uthman saying: ""Some people have come to me who have neither intellect nor deen (faith). Islam is burdensome to them and justice vexes them. They do not aim for Allah in anything nor do they speak by any proof. They are busy with sedition and appropriating the property of the non Muslims. Allah is the One who will test and try them. Then He will be the One to disgrace them and humiliate them. They are those who injure people."" Then they were sent to Abdur r Rahman ibn Khalid ibn Walid. He said to them: ""Tools of Shaytan! You have no welcome! Shaytan has returned in sorrow and yet you are still active! May Allah disappoint Abdur Rahman if he does not discipline you until he makes you feel regret! O company of a people whom I do not know to be Arab or non Arab, you will not say to me what I heard you said to Muawiyah! I am the son of Khalid ibn al-Walid. I am the son of the one who was tested by the teeth. I am the son of the one who knocked out the Ridda!"" He mentioned the Ridda and not the defeat of the Byzantine or the Persian because he recognized that these people were an internal threat. The Qurra had previously fought in the Ridda wars alongside Khalid ibn al-Walid but now had political and economic interests that were different from the rest of the Muslims. Abdur r Rahman ibn Khalid ibn Walid then sent them to Uthman in Madina. In Madina they took an oath that they will not cause trouble and following the example of Muhammad, Uthman accepted their word and let them go. They then split up and went to various different Muslim centers and started fomenting rebellion, particularly in Egypt. In the best selling book, Shadow of the sword, The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World, Tom Holland writes ""Uthman was not content to divide up the loot of the old empires in the time-honoured manner of a bandit chieftain sharing out plunder after a successful raid. The Arabs, so it seemed to the new Amir had moved on from that. The conquerors, if they were to make best use of the defeated superpowers bureaucracies, would themselves have to accept certain disciplines: a central administration, not least, and a clear-cut chain of command. Precisely the marks of slavery, in short, that the desert Arabs had always derided."" The Qurra then felt that Abu Musa al_Ashari could look after their interests better. Sa'id ibn al-As, the governor in Kufa, in Iraq, then wrote to Uthman ""I have no power at all over Kufa with Al-Ashtar and his friends who are called al-qurra, and they are idiots"" In 655/634 the Qurra stopped Uthans governor Sa'id ibn al-As at Jara'a, preventing him from entering Kufa and declared Abu Musa al-Ashari to be their governor. (Later the Qurra proposed Abu Musa al_Ashari as the arbitrator against the wished of Ali after the Battle of Saffin because they felt that he could also better represent their interests there and split away from Ali and became officially known as the Khawarij.) In 656, The Qurra approached Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr the son of Abu Bakr and the adopted son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and the great grandfather of Ja'far al-Sadiq and asked him why he was not a governor. They had fought under the service of his father in the Ridda wars. They also asked Uthman's adopted son, Muhammad bin Abi Hudhaifa, who Uthman had refused to appoint as a governor of any province, why he was not a governor. There were references to these people in earlier texts too. Abū Dharr narrated that Muhammad said: Aḥmad, Muslim, and Ibn Mājah “There will definitely be a people after me from my nation who recite the Quran yet it will not even reach beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through a target, then they will not return back to it. They are the worst of people, the worst of all creatures.” al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Abū Dāwūd, and al-Nasā`ī all recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al- Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) that he said: ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) sent some gold to the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) so divided and distributed it among four groups: al-Aqra’ Ibn Ḥābis al-Ḥanẓalī, al-Mujāshi’ī, ‘Uyaynah Ibn Badr al-Fazārī, and Zayd al-Ṭā`ī; a man from the Nabhān tribe and ‘Alqamah Ibn ‘Ulāthah al-‘Āmirī; then a man from the Kilāb tribe. (The Muslims of) Quraysh and the residents of Medina became upset and said, “He gives to the noble one from Najd and leaves us?” The prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said: “I am only trying to unite their hearts.” Then a man with sunken eyes, thick cheeks, a high forehead, a thick beard, and a shaven head came up and said, “Fear Allah, Muhammad!” He replied: “Who would obey Allah if I were disobedient (to Him)? Allah trusts me with regards to the people of the earth but you don’t trust me?” After the man left, he said: يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ مُرُوقَ السَّهْمِ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ يَقْتُلُونَ أَهْلَ الإِسْلامِ وَيَدَعُونَ أَهْلَ “From the progeny of this man,” or he said, “From the offspring of this man, there will come a people who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats. They will go through the religion like a arrow going through a target. They will murder the people of Islam while ignoring the people of idol-worship. If I were to reach them (their time), I would destroy them like the people of ‘Ād were destroyed.”  Some modern scholars like R. E. Brunnow trace the origins of the Qurra and the Kharitites back to Bedouin stock and desert tribesmen, who had become soldiers not out of commitment to Islam but to share the spoils. Brunnow held that the Kharijites were Bedouin Arabs (Beduinenaraber) or full blooded Arabs. Anti-Uthman sentiment. According to Muslim sources, unlike his predecessor, Umar, who maintained discipline with a stern hand, Uthman was less rigorous upon his people; he focused more on economic prosperity. Under Uthman, the people became economically more prosperous and on the political plane they came to enjoy a larger degree of freedom. No institutions were devised to channel political activity, and, in the absence of such institutions, the pre-Islamic tribal jealousies and rivalries, which had been suppressed under earlier caliphs, erupted once again. In view of the lenient policies adopted by Uthman, the people took advantage of such liberties, which became a headache for the state, and it culminated in the assassination of Uthman. According to some contemporary salafi scholars, the foreign powers became nervous at the success of the Muslims under the leadership of Uthman, and now their only hope lay in aiding and abetting subversive movements within the territories of Uthman's caliphate. According to some viewpoints, under such circumstances, leaders like Abdullah Ibn Saba, felt that it was a good opportunity to accomplish their aims of rebellion by starting arguments over religion. Wilferd Madelung from the Institute for Ismaili Studies discredits the alleged role of Abdullah ibn Saba in the rebellion against Uthman, Madelung observes that ‘’few if any modern historians would accept Sayf's legend of Ibn Saba’’ How ever there is much Jewish literature from that time, regarding Adbullah ibn Saba and the Jewish community in Iraq and the Exilarch. Much of the Jewish literature on Adbullah ibn Saba from that time regards Adbullah ibn Saba as an apostate from Judaism and asks Jews to keep away from him. Uthman's emissaries to the provinces. The situation was becoming tense and so the Uthman administration had to investigate the origins and extent of anti-government propaganda and its aims. Some time around 654, Uthman called all the governors of his 12 provinces to Medina to discuss the problem. In this Council of Governors, Uthman directed the governors that they should adopt all the expedients they had suggested, according to local circumstances. Later, in the Majlis al Shurah (council of ministry), it was suggested to Uthman that reliable agents should be sent to various provinces to investigate the matter and report about the sources of such rumours. Uthman accordingly sent his agents to the main provinces, Muhammad ibn Maslamah was sent to Kufa; Usama ibn Zayd was sent to Basra; Ammar ibn Yasir was sent to Egypt, while `Abd Allah ibn Umar was sent to Syria. The emissaries who had been sent to Kufa, Basra, and Syria submitted their reports to Uthman, that all was well in Kufa, Basra and Syria. The people were satisfied with the administration, and they had no legitimate grievance against it. Some individuals in various locations had some personal grievances of minor character, with which the people at large were not concerned. Abdullah ibn Saad, the governor of Egypt, reported about the activities of the opposition in Egypt. He wanted to take action against Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr (""The son of Abu Bakr adopted by Ali"") and Muhammad bin Abi Hudhaifa (""adopted son of Uthman""). However, Uthman did not want Abdullah ibn Saad to be harsh against them because he held them in high regard. After the Egyptian emissary's failure, Uthman looked for further developments in Egypt. Further measures. In 655, Uthman directed the people who had any grievance against the administration to assemble at Mecca for the Hajj. He promised them that all their legitimate grievances would be redressed. He directed the governors and the ""Amils"" throughout the empire to come to Mecca on the occasion of the Hajj. In response to the call of Uthman, the opposition came in large delegations from various cities to present their grievances before the gathering. Uthman addressed the people and gave a long explanation of the criticism about himself and his administration and then said: ""I have had my say. Now I am prepared to listen to you. If any one of you has any legitimate grievance against me or my Government you are free to give expression to such grievance, and I assure you that, I will do my best to redress such grievance."" The rebels realized that the people in Mecca supported the defence offered by Uthman and were not in the mood to listen to them. That was a great psychological victory for Uthman. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman’s cousin, suggested Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (referring to Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move. Agitation in Medina. After the Hajj of 655 things remained quiet for some time. With the dawn of the year 656, Medina, the capital city of Uthman, became a hotbed of intrigue and unrest. Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr returned to Medina from Egypt, and assisted in leading a campaign against the Caliphate of Uthman. When the crisis deepened in Medina, Uthman addressed the congregation in the Masjid-e-Nabawi and gave an explanation and rebuttal of all the claims against him. The general public was again satisfied with Uthman. He had hoped that after his speech in which he had explained his position, and offered full defence for his actions, the allegedly false propaganda against him would cease. Armed revolt against Uthman. The politics of Egypt played the major role in the propaganda war against the caliphate, so Uthman summoned Abdullah ibn Saad, the governor of Egypt, to Medina to consult with him as to the course of action that should be adopted. Abdullah ibn Saad came to Medina, leaving the affairs of Egypt to his deputy, and in his absence, Muhammad bin Abi Hudhaifa (""adopted son of Uthman"") staged a coup d'état and took power. On hearing of the revolt in Egypt, Abdullah hastened back but Uthman was not in a position to offer him any military assistance and, accordingly, Abdullah ibn Saad failed to recapture his power. The Qurra then felt that Abu Musa al_Ashari could look after their interests better. Sa'id ibn al-As, the governor in Kufa, in Iraq, then wrote to Uthman ""I have no power at all over Kufa with Al-Ashtar and his friends who are called al-qurra, and they are idiots"" In 655/634 the Qurra stopped Uthans governor Sa'id ibn al-As at Jara'a, preventing him from entering Kufa and declared Abu Musa al-Ashari to be their governor. (Later the Qurra proposed Abu Musa al_Ashari as the arbitrator against the wished of Ali after the Battle of Saffin because they felt that he could also better represent their interests there and split away from Ali and became officially known as the Khawarij.) In Basra the governor, Abdullah ibn Aamir, left for Hajj, and in his absence the affairs of the province fell into a state of confusion. The three main provinces of Egypt (which was already the center of the dissident movement), Kufa, and Basra became essentially independent from the Caliphate of Uthman, and became the center of revolt. Rebels in Medina. From Egypt a contingent of about 1,000 people were sent to Medina, with instructions to assassinate Uthman and overthrow the government. Similar contingents marched from Kufa and Basra to Medina. They sent their representatives to Medina to contact the leaders of public opinion. The representatives of the contingent from Egypt waited on Ali, and offered him the Caliphate in succession to Uthman, which Ali turned down. The representatives of the contingent from Kufa waited on Al-Zubayr, while the representatives of the contingent from Basra waited on Talhah, and offered them their allegiance as the next Caliph, which were both turned down. In proposing alternatives to Uthman as Caliph, the rebels neutralized the bulk of public opinion in Medina and Uthman's faction could no longer offer a united front. Uthman had the active support of the Umayyads, and a few other people in Medina, but the rest of the people of Medina chose to be neutral and help neither side. Siege of Uthman. The situation in Medina was a big gain for the rebels. When they felt satisfied that the people of Medina would not offer them any resistance, they entered the city of Medina and laid siege to the house of Uthman, essentially taking it over but not confining the Caliph. The rebels declared that no harm from them would come to any person who choose not to resist them. Uthman strongly instructed his supporters to refrain from violence but his various servants (about 40 of them) appealed for permission to fight against the rebels, along with a thousand other citizens of Medina. Uthman, who was a wealthy man even from the days before Islam, freed all 40 of his slaves and ordered them to stay away from the civil war between the Muslims. The early stage of the siege of Uthman’s house was not severe, the rebels merely hovered around the house and did not place any restrictions on him. Uthman went to the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi as usual, and led the prayers. The rebels offered prayers under the leadership of Uthman. While Uthman addressed the people in the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi he was criticized by opponents. At this the supporters of Uthman took up cudgels on his behalf. Tempers flared up on both sides, hot words were exchanged between the parties, and that led to the pelting of stones at one another. One of the stones hit Uthman, he fell unconscious and was carried to his house, still unconscious. The proceedings in the mosque showed that most of the people of Medina (or at least those in the mosque) preferred not to fight, but to watch developments. When the rebels felt that the people of Medina were not likely to offer active support to Uthman, they changed their strategy, and tightened the siege of the house of Uthman, thus confining Uthman to his home. Uthman was denied the freedom to move about and was not allowed to go to the mosque. As the days passed, the rebels intensified their pressure against Uthman. They forbade the entry of any food or provisions, and later water as well, into his house, even turning down a few widows of Muhammad. Ramlah bint Abi-Sufyan, a widow of Muhammad, came to see Uthman and brought some water and provisions for him but she was not allowed to enter. Another widow of Muhammad, and the daughter of the late Caliph Abu Bakr, Aisha, made a similar attempt, and she was also prevailed upon by the rebels to go back. When Ali first heard about the siege of Uthman, he sent his sons Hassan and Hussayn to protect Uthman. Zubayr ibn Awwam sent his son Abdullah ibn Zubair and Talha ibn Ubaydullah sent his son also sent his son to protect Uthman. With the departure of the pilgrims from Medina to Mecca, the hands of the rebels were further strengthened, and as a consequence the crisis deepened further. The rebels understood that after the Hajj, the Muslims gathered at Mecca from all parts of the Muslim world might march to Medina to relieve Uthman. They therefore decided to take action against Uthman before the pilgrimage was over. During the siege, Uthman was asked by his supporters, who outnumbered the rebels, to let them fight against the rebels and rout them. Uthman prevented them in an effort to avoid the bloodshed of Muslim by Muslim. Unfortunately for Uthman, violence occurred anyhow. The gates of the house of Uthman were shut and guarded by the renowned warrior, Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The sons of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, were also among the guards; while amongst those inciting the people to fight included Aisha, one of the wives of Muhammad. A skirmish erupted between the opponents and the supporters of Uthman at the gate, some anti-Uthman partisans were killed, and the rebels were finally pushed back. Among the supporters of Uthman, Hasan ibn Ali, Marwan and some other people were wounded. Assassination. Finding the gate of Uthman's house strongly guarded by his supporters, the Qurra climbed the back wall and sneaked inside, leaving the guards on the gate unaware of what was going on inside. Hassan and Hussein were also guarding Uthman at the time. The rebels entered his room and struck blows at his head. Naila, the wife of Uthman, threw herself on his body to protect him. Raising her hand to protect him she had her fingers chopped off and was pushed aside, and further blows were struck until he was dead. The supporters of Uthman then counterattacked the assassins and, in turn, killed them. There was further fighting between the rebels and the supporters of Uthman, with casualties on both sides, after which the rebels looted the house. According to Encyclopedia of Islam, Muawiyah sent a relief force led by Habib ibn Maslama al-Fihri to protect Uthman, but events moved so fast that Uthman got killed before they arrived, so they turned back from the wadi I kura According to al-Baladhuri one of the earliest books of these events, Ali was furious and slapped Hassan and Hussein saying ""How did he get killed when you were at the door?"" The rioters wanted to mutilate his body and were keen that he be denied burial. When some of the rioters came forward to mutilate the body of Uthman, his two widows, Nailah and Ramlah bint Sheibah, covered him, and raised loud cries which deterred the rioters. The rebels left the house and the supporters of Uthman at gate hearing it, entered, but it was too late. Thereafter the rioters maintained a presence round the house in order to prevent the dead body from being carried to the graveyard. Uthman was assassinated on the 18 Dhul Haj. Funeral. After the body of Uthman had been in the house for three days, Naila, Uthman's wife, approached some of his supporters to help in his burial, but only about a dozen people responded. These included Marwan, Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Huwatib bin Alfarah, Jabir bin Muta'am, Abu Jahm bin Hudaifa, Hakim bin Hazam and Niyar bin Mukarram. The body was lifted at dusk, and because of the blockade, no coffin could be procured. The body was not washed, as Islamic teaching states that martyrs' bodies are not supposed to be washed before burial. Thus Uthman was carried to the graveyard in the clothes that he was wearing at the time of his assassination. His body was buried by Hassan and Hussein Naila followed the funeral with a lamp, but in order to maintain secrecy the lamp had to be extinguished. Naila was accompanied by some women including Ayesha, Uthman's daughter. Burial. The body was carried to Jannat al-Baqi, the Muslim graveyard. It appears that some people gathered there, and they resisted the burial of Uthman in the graveyard of the Muslims. The supporters of Uthman insisted that the body should be buried in Jannat al-Baqi. They later buried him in the Jewish graveyard behind Jannat al-Baqi. Some decades later, the Umayyad rulers demolished the wall separating the two cemeteries and merged the Jewish cemetery into the Muslim one to ensure that his tomb was now inside a Muslim cemetery. The funeral prayers were led by Jabir bin Muta'am, and the dead body was lowered into the grave without much of a ceremony. After burial, Naila the widow of Uthman and Aisha the daughter of Uthman wanted to speak, but they were advised to remain quiet due to possible danger from the rioters. Ali later confronted the Kharijites. Ali later assumed the position of caliph. Following the Roman-Persian Wars and the Byzantine–Sasanian wars there were deep rooted differences between Iraq, formally under the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire. The Iraqis wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in Kufa so as to bring revenues into their area and oppose Syria. They convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish the capital in Kufa, in Iraq. Ali later moved the capital to Kufa. After making everyone else fight, the Qurra later turned against Ali. Ali wanted Malik Ashtar or Abdullah bin Abbas to be appointed as an arbitrator for the people of Kufa, Iraq, after the battle of Saffin, but the Qurra strongly demurred. They nominated Abu Musa al-Ashari as their arbitrator. (During the time of Uthman, they had appointed Abu Musa al-Ashari as the Governor of Kufa and removed Uthams governor before they started fighting Uthman) After the battle of Saffin the Qurra realised that Ali could not safeguard their interests and therefore split off and formed their own Party called the Kharijites and later developed into an anarchist movement  They also started killing Ali's supporters. They considered anyone who was not part of their group as an unbeliever. In the best selling book, Shadow of the sword, The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World, Tom Holland writes ""The Kharijites argued a true believer would have trusted his fate not to diplomacy but to ongoing warfare and God will decide."" Even though they them selves had put forward their representative and become a party of them selves, so that the negotiations could go in their favor and satisfy their own political and economic interests. Tom Holland says that ""they then condemned Ali as an unbeliever, as the man who had strayed from the Strait Path. The fact that he was Muhammad's nephew only confirmed them in their militancy of their egalitarianism; that the true aristocracy was one of piety and not blood. Even a Companion of the Prophet, if he did not pray until he developed marks on his forehead. If he did not look pale and haggard from regular fasting, if he did not live like a lion by day and a monk by night, ranked in the opinion of the Kharijites as no better than an apostate."" They then developed even more twisted views. Tom Holland writes ""Other Kharijites, so it was reported, might go out and with their swords into the markets while people would stand around not realizing what was happening; they would shout ""no judgment except God!"" and plunge their blades into whom ever they could reach and go on killing until they them selves were killed. In 659 Ali's forces finally moved against the Kharijites and they finally met in the Battle of Nahrawan. Although Ali won the battle, the constant conflict had begun to affect his standing. Tom Holland writes ""Ali won a victory over them as crushing as it was to prove pyrrhic: for all he had done, in effect was to fertilise the soil of Iraq with the blood of their martyrs. Three years later, and there came the inevitable blowback: a Kharijite assassin."". The Kharijites caused so much trouble that in both the Sunni and the Shia books Ali said:""With regard to me, two categories of people will be ruined, namely he who loves me too much and the love takes him away from rightfulness, and he who hates me too much and the hatred takes him away from rightfulness. The best man with regard to me is he who is on the middle course. So be with him and be with the great majority of Muslims because Allah’s hand of protection is on keeping unity. You should beware of division because the one isolated from the group is a prey to Satan just as the one isolated from the flock of sheep is a prey to the wolf. Beware! Whoever calls to this course sectarianism, kill him, even though he may be under this headband of mine.""(Nahjul Balagha, Sermon 126) Ali was assassinated by Kharijites in 661. On the 19th of Ramadan, while Praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, Ali was attacked by the Khawarij Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam. He was wounded by ibn Muljam's poison-coated sword while prostrating in the Fajr prayer. Scholars like Wellhausen have argued that the Kharijites when revolting against Ali used the same formula as they had previously applied against Uthman, when they revolted against Uthman. Wellhausen argues that for the Kharijite Ali's pact with Muawiyah compromised the Devine Right the same act which caused the insurgencies against Uthman and Muawiya as well. Scholars like Wellhausen argue that the Kharijites sprang from the Qurra and they did not start off as a marginal and clandestine sect, but were in full public eye. Wellhausen argues that: ""Their origins were essentially very different from those of the Abbasid and Fatimid parties. They did not have to resort to conspiracy and widespread propaganda and were not held together by a secret complex organization. They had only principles but these were always well known to the people and attracted supporters without them seeking them"". M. A. Shaban in his Islamic History A.D. 600-750 (A.H. 132): A new Interpretation (1971) Proclaims that the Qurra were the tribesmen who had the trusteeship of the conquered lands. This means that they shared the wealth and the prestige of the new system. Their special position and prestige in the Sawad in Iraq however was threatened by Uthmans policies. This explains their participation in removing Uthman. Although the policy of Ali was lucrative to the Qurra they realized that the new Caliph's inheritance of a divided community and turmoil would make his unable to protect their newly established economic status. Thus at this stage and during the Battle of Siffin (Ali's weakest moments) the Qurra decided to secede from Ali's coalition and become a party of their own.  In the article entitled ""The Emergence of the Kharijites: Religion and the Social Order in Early Islam"" (1989) Jeffrey T Kenny has argued that the Kharijites were just one of many factions that emerged from an intricate web of chaning socioeconomic policies in the newly established provinces of the Islamic Empire. M. A. Shaban in his book Islamic History A.D. 600-750 (A.H. 132): A new Interpretation (1971) writes the Qurra insisted on choosing Abu Musa al Ashari to be the Iraqi representative after the battle of Siffin despite Ali's vehement objection. Shaban writes that the same Qurra originally insisted on Abu Musa becoming the governor of Kufa and replaced Uthmans governor because Abu Musa had opposed Uthman's policy and therefore had been the choice of the Qurra as governor of Kufa, when they expelled Uthmans governor Sa'id b Al-As. Shaban adds that the Qurra tried to turn the negotiations between the Syrians and the Iraqis to their own advantage and that they wished to become a third party in the dispute. Thus it is at this point that the coalition of Ali ended and that the ex-qurra emerged as the Kharijites. While Watt argues that the Kharijites were not simply dissatisfied with a particular man or family or economics, rather their dissatisfaction was with the whole social structure which was represented by both Uthman and Ali. In the old way they had freedom in the affairs of the tribe. Now they were in the ""super-tribe"" of Islam and could not behave as they had behaved previously. They wanted to go back to their old tribal structure where they could glory and boast about their tribe. He writes ""Those who had been accustomed to tribal societies missed the security ... provided by the old system; nothing in the new system quite replaced it After the death of Ali the Kharijites got stronger in Iraq and Hassan made a peace agreement with Muawiya. Two decades later, after years of planning and scheming and making every one else fight, Marwan came to power in Syria and the Qurra (the Kharijites) established a state in Southern Iraq. The very thing Hassan signed a treaty with Muawiyah to avoid. Now there were three camps, the Scholars in Madina, the Kharijites in Iraq and Umayyads in Syria. In Sahih Al Bukhari the people still referred to the Kharijites by their old name Qurra and most Muslims resented these civil wars and felt that the Arabs had left the teachings of Muhammad and gone back to their old ways of fighting over wealth. Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 9, Book 88, Number 228:  Narrated by Abu Al-Minhal When Ibn Ziyad and Marwan were in Sham and Ibn Az-zubair took over the authority in Mecca and Qurra' (the Kharijites) revolted in Basra, I went out with my father to Abu Barza Al-Aslami till we entered upon him in his house while he was sitting in the shade of a room built of cane. So we sat with him and my father started talking to him saying, ""O Abu Barza! Don't you see in what dilemma the people has fallen?"" The first thing heard him saying ""I seek reward from Allah for myself because of being angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were in misery and were few in number and misguided, and that Allah has brought you out of all that with Islam and with Muhammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which you see now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you. The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain: and those who are among you, by Allah, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and that one who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-zubair) by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain."" Family of Uthman. Uthman belonged to the Umayyad branch of the Quraish tribe. He was the son of Affan ibn Abi al-'As and Urwa bint Kariz. Urwa bore only two children from Affan: Uthman and his sister Amna. After the death of Affan, Urwa married Uqbah ibn Abu Mu'ayt, to whom she bore three sons and a daughter: Pre-conversion. He had following children from them, Amr, was the eldest son of Uthman, and during the pre-Islamic period, Uthman was known by the surname of ""Abu'Amr"". Post-conversion. Uthman was nicknamed Thun-Nurayn (Zunnorain) (, literally: possessor of two lights), because of his marriage with two of Prophet Muhammad's daughters. When she died, Uthman was married to her sister, Legacy. Islamic history, particularly Sunni history, remembers Uthman in positive terms, calling him handsome, generous, and plain rather than luxurious. It is said that Uthman was one of the most handsome and charming men of his time. Uthman was well known for his reported generosity. During Muhammad's time, while in Medina, he financed the project for the construction of the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and purchased the well ""Beer Rauma"", which he dedicated to the free use of all Muslims. Uthman’s generosity continued after he became caliph. Uthman apparently led a simple life even after becoming the Caliph of the Rashidun Empire, though it would have been easy for a successful businessman such as him to lead a luxurious life. The caliphs were paid for their services from bait al-mal, the public treasury, but Uthman never took any salary for his service as a Caliph, as he was independently wealthy. Uthman also developed a custom to free slaves every Friday, look after the widows and orphans, and give unlimited charity. His patience and endurance were among the characteristics that made him a successful leader. He was a devoted Muslim, As a way of taking care of Muhammad’s wives, he doubled their allowances. Uthman wasn't completely plain and simple, however: Uthman built a Palace for himself in Medina, known as Al-Zawar, with a notable feature being doors of precious wood. Although Uthman paid for the palace with his own money, Shia Muslims consider it his first step towards ruling like a King. Uthman's sister Amna bint Affan was married to Abdur Rahman bin Awf, one of the closest companion of Muhammad. Sunni view of Uthman. According to the Sunni account of Uthman, he was married to two of Muhammad’s daughters at separate times, earning him the name ""Zun-Nurayn (Dhun Nurayn)"" or the ""Possessor of Two Lights."". In this he was supposed to outrank Ali, who had married only one of Muhammad's daughters. Sunni Muslims also consider Uthman as one of the ten Sahaba (companions) for whom Muhammad had testified that they were destined for Paradise . He was a wealthy and very noble man. When he became khalifa, he used the same method Umar did. Uthman is regarded by Sunnis as a beacon of light who refused to participate in the civil conflict. The claims against his wealth do not detract from his personal sacrifice against the rebels. Amal. Uthman was a prominent figure in Islam and history in general and a successful business man, however accounts of his amal (good actions) are numerous and suggested a different side to Uthman, a side that rarely gets publicized. In the times of Umar there was a severe famine. All the people of Madinah were suffering due to the shortage of food. A caravan made up of a thousand camels loaded with a large stock of food grains belonging to Uthman arrived from Shaam (Syria). Several merchants offered to buy all of it. He asked them what profit they would pay. ""Five per cent,"" they said. He answered that he could get higher profit than that. They began to argue with him, saying that they did not know of any merchant who would offer him more than their quote. He said to them, ""I know of one who repays a profit of more than seven hundred to a dirham (Arabian currency)."" He then recited the verse of the Quran in which Allah mentioned this profit. ""The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the Way of Allah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allah gives manifold increase to whom He pleases. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower."" (2:261). ""O traders! Bear witness with me that I donate all this to the poor people of Madinah!"" said Uthman. ‘Abdur-Rahman ibn ‘Uthman reported that, “One night I was praying when someone touched me on my back. I saw that it was ‘Uthman, the leader of the believers. I made space for him and then he started to pray. He recited the whole Qur’an in one single rakah and then came out of prayer. I said to him, ‘But you have prayed only one rakah’ “That is my Witr prayer.” he said.” Ruhaimah said, “‘Uthman used to fast all the time and used to stay awake the whole night in prayer, except for a short time after ‘Ishaa’.” Non-Muslims. Bernard Lewis, a 20th-century scholar, says of Uthman: According to Ronald Bodley, during Muhammad's lifetime Uthman was not an outstanding figure and was not assigned to any authority, and was not ever distinguished in any of Muhammad's campaigns. Bodley also believed that after Umar's assassination, Ali rejected the caliphate as he disagreed with governing according to regulations established by Abu Bakr and Umar, and that Uthman, being less honest than Ali, accepted those terms which he failed to administrate during his ten years Caliphate. He subjected most of the Islamic nation to his relatives, Bani Umayya, who were partially accursed during Muhamad's lifetime. Uthman compiled the Qur'an, and burnt its other copies. Uthman's governing policies and nepotism led to openly rise of dissatisfaction and resistance throughout most of the empire, especially among noble Companions of Muhammad  References.

wikipedia-2386953," Japan Air Self-Defense Force  The , or JASDF, is the aviation branch of the Japan Self-Defense Forces responsible for the defense of Japanese airspace and other aerospace operations. The JASDF carries out combat air patrols around Japan, while also maintaining an extensive network of ground and air early warning radar systems. The branch also has an aerobatic team known as Blue Impulse and has recently been involved in providing air transport in several UN peacekeeping missions. The JASDF had an estimated 45,000 personnel in 2005, and as of 2013 operates 791 aircraft. Of those 791 aircraft in service approximately 350 are fighter aircraft. History. Formation. Before forming the Japanese Self-Defense Forces after World War II, Japan did not have a separate air force. Aviation operations were carried out by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service. Following World War II the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy were dissolved and replaced by the JSDF with the passing of the 1954 Self-Defense Forces Law with the JASDF as the aviation branch. Organization. Major units of the JASDF are the Air Defense Command, Air Support Command, Air Training Command, Air Development and Test Command, and Air Materiel Command. The Air Support Command is responsible for direct support of operational forces in rescue, transportation, control, weather monitoring and inspection. The Air Training Command is responsible for basic flying and technical training. The Air Development and Test Command, in addition to overseeing equipment research and development, is also responsible for research and development in such areas as flight medicine. The Air Defense Command has northern, central, and western regional headquarters located at Misawa, Iruma, and Kasuga, respectively and the Southwestern Composite Air Division based at Naha on Okinawa. All four regional headquarters control surface-to-air missile units of both the JASDF and the JGSDF located in their respective areas. Ranks. Ranks are listed with the lower rank at right. Equipment. The JASDF maintains an integrated network of radar installations and air defense direction centers throughout the country known as the Basic Air Defense Ground Environment. In the late 1980s, the system was modernized and augmented with E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft. The nation relies on fighter-interceptor aircraft and surface-to-air missiles to intercept hostile aircraft. Both of these systems were improved from the beginning of the late 1980s. Outmoded aircraft were replaced in the early 1990s with more sophisticated models, and Nike-J missiles have been replaced with the modern Patriot PAC-2 system. The JASDF also provides air support for ground and sea operations of the JGSDF and the JMSDF and air defense for bases of all the forces. Although support fighter squadrons started being modernized in 1989, they lacked precision-guided weapons for support of ground operations and attacks on hostile ships, and JASDF pilots receive little flight training over oceans to prepare for maritime operations. Base defenses were upgraded in the late 1980s with new surface-to-air missiles, modern antiaircraft artillery and new fixed and mobile aircraft shelters. The JASDF is not allowed to have strategic bombers for that would go against the self-defense–only policy. ""See also List of military aircraft of Japan"" Future equipment. ""Sources:"" "
wikipedia-332215," Gobelins Manufactory  The Manufacture des Gobelins is a tapestry factory located in Paris, France, at 42 avenue des Gobelins, near the Les Gobelins métro station in the XIIIe arrondissement. It is best known as a royal factory supplying the court of Louis XIV and later monarchs; it is now run by the French Ministry of Culture, and open for guided tours several afternoons per week by appointment. Royal factory. The Gobelins were a family of dyers who, in the middle of the 15th century, established themselves in the , Paris, on the banks of the Bièvre. In 1602, Henry IV of France rented factory space for his Flemish tapestry makers on the current location of the Gobelins Manufactory adjoining the Bièvre river. In 1662 the works in the Faubourg Saint Marcel, with the adjoining grounds, were purchased by Jean-Baptiste Colbert on behalf of Louis XIV and made into a general upholstery factory, in which designs both in tapestry and in all kinds of furniture were executed under the superintendence of the royal painter, Charles Le Brun, who served as director and chief designer from 1663-1690. On account of Louis XIV's financial problems, the establishment was closed in 1694, but reopened in 1697 for the manufacture of tapestry, chiefly for royal use. It rivalled the Beauvais tapestry works until the French Revolution, when work at the factory was suspended. The Bourbons revived the factory during the Bourbon Restoration and, in 1826, the manufacture of carpets was added to that of tapestry. In 1871 the building was partly burned down by the Communards. The factory is still in operation as a state-run institution. Historical site. Today the manufactory consists of a set of four irregular buildings dating to the seventeenth century, plus the building on the avenue des Gobelins built by Jean-Camille Formigé in 1912 after the 1871 fire. They contain Le Brun's residence and workshops that served as foundries for most of the bronze statues in the park of Versailles, as well as looms on which tapestries are woven following seventeenth century techniques. The Gobelins still produces some limited amount of tapestries for the decoration of French governmental institutions, with contemporary subjects. "

It was the band's first album with the relatively large Beggars Banquet label, and was produced by John Leckie. Paul Hanley left the band immediately after the accompanying UK tour, ending the group's distinctive ""twin drummers"" period. Three older songs were returned to during these sessions. ""Oh! Brother"" and ""Copped It"" dated back to the group's earliest incarnation and ""Draygo's Guilt"" was being performed live in 1981. The album's cover artwork (like its predecessor Perverted By Language) was painted by Danish-born artist Claus Castenskiold. On its original release, it was available in two formats – on vinyl, and as an extended cassette entitled ""Escape Route from aie Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall"" which added all the material from the three singles the group issued in 1984. ""The Wonderful and Frightening World"" was released as a 4-CD ""Omnibus Edition"" by Beggars Banquet in October 2010. Production. The album was produced by John Leckie.

wikipedia-11172503," The Tractors  The Tractors are an American country rock band composed of a loosely associated group of musicians, headed by guitarist Steve Ripley. Under the band's original lineup, The Tractors was signed to Arista Records in 1994, releasing their self-titled debut album that year; the album only produced one Top 40 hit on the ""Billboard"" country charts. To date, the band has followed up with five more albums. Since their foundation, most of the band's original members have moved on to separate projects, although they often collaborate with frontman Ripley on The Tractors' more recent recordings. Ripley is the only official member of the group; he has stated that The Tractors is more of a ""state of mind"", and the band contains a largely undefined cast of unofficial contributors. Biography. The Tractors were formed in 1988, with the original lineup comprising Ron Getman (electric guitar, slide guitar), Jamie Oldaker (drums), Walt Richmond (bass vocals, keyboards), Steve Ripley (guitar, lead vocals), and Casey van Beek (bass guitar, baritone vocals). All five members had previously been backing musicians for other notable artists, including Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt, and Leonard Cohen. Oldaker had also worked with Bob Seger and Eric Clapton. By 1990, the group was signed to Arista Records, a newly formed record label based in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1994, the group released its self-titled debut album. The album, which produced the single Baby Likes to Rock It, soon became the fastest-selling debut album from a country group to go platinum. That album was soon followed by a Christmas album called ""Have Yourself a Tractors Christmas"". The Tractors was nominated for two Grammy Awards., The Tractors won the Country Weekly 1995 Golden Pick Award for Favorite New Group.  The group's true follow-up, ""Farmers in a Changing World"", was released in 1998. The band's members, except for Ripley, soon departed for other projects, although they and Ripley remained close friends, and made cameo appearances on subsequent albums. Ripley, along with several other musicians, released the next Tractors album, ""Fast Girl"", on Audium Entertainment in 2001. After ""Fast Girl"", the Tractors left Audium as well, and soon formed its own label, Boy Rocking Records. In 2009 ""Trade Union"" was released on E1. Sound. The Tractors achieved their distinctive sound in several ways, most notably from the use of only one microphone, or recording a song in only one take. Ripley often constructs guitars and cords for use in the band. "
wikipedia-4214," Bioinformatics  Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops and improves on methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data. A major activity in bioinformatics is to develop software tools to generate useful biological knowledge. Bioinformatics uses many areas of computer science, mathematics and engineering to process biological data. Complex machines are used to read in biological data at a much faster rate than before. Databases and information systems are used to store and organize biological data. Analyzing biological data may involve algorithms in artificial intelligence, soft computing, data mining, image processing, and simulation. The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical foundations such as discrete mathematics, control theory, system theory, information theory, and statistics. Commonly used software tools and technologies in the field include Java, C#, XML, Perl, C, C++, Python, R, SQL, CUDA, MATLAB, and spreadsheet applications. Introduction. History. Building on the recognition of the importance of information transmission, accumulation and processing in biological systems, in 1970 Paulien Hogeweg, coined the term ""Bioinformatics"" to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems. This definition placed bioinformatics as a field parallel to biophysics (the study of physical processes in biological systems) or biochemistry (the study of chemical processes in biological systems). Examples of relevant biological information processes studied in the early days of bioinformatics are the formation of complex social interaction structures by simple behavioral rules, and the information accumulation and maintenance in models of prebiotic evolution. One early contributor to bioinformatics was Elvin A. Kabat, who pioneered biological sequence analysis in 1970 with his comprehensive volumes of antibody sequences released with Tai Te Wu between 1980 and 1991. Another significant pioneer in the field was Margaret Oakley Dayhoff, who has been hailed by David Lipman, director of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, as the ""mother and father of bioinformatics."" At the beginning of the ""genomic revolution"", the term bioinformatics was re-discovered to refer to the creation and maintenance of a database to store biological information such as nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences. Development of this type of database involved not only design issues but the development of complex interfaces whereby researchers could access existing data as well as submit new or revised data. Goals. In order to study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data. This includes nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures. The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as computational biology. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include: The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal. Examples include: pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning algorithms, and visualization. Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding, genome assembly, drug design, drug discovery, protein structure alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene expression and protein–protein interactions, genome-wide association studies, and the modeling of evolution. Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data. Over the past few decades rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes. Approaches. Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing DNA and protein sequences, aligning different DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures. There are two fundamental ways of modelling a Biological system (e.g., living cell) both coming under Bioinformatic approaches. A broad sub-category under bioinformatics is structural bioinformatics. Major research areas. Bioinformatics has become an important part of many areas of biology. In experimental molecular biology, bioinformatics techniques such as image and signal processing allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics and genomics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations. It plays a role in the textual mining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data. It plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in the comparison of genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of systems biology. In structural biology, it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA, RNA, and protein structures as well as molecular interactions. Sequence analysis. Since the Phage Φ-X174 was sequenced in 1977, the DNA sequences of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode polypeptides (proteins), RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a species or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of molecular systematics to construct phylogenetic trees). With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today, computer programs such as BLAST are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms, containing over 190 billion nucleotides. These programs can compensate for mutations (exchanged, deleted or inserted bases) in the DNA sequence, to identify sequences that are related, but not identical. A variant of this sequence alignment is used in the sequencing process itself. The so-called shotgun sequencing technique (which was used, for example, by The Institute for Genomic Research to sequence the first bacterial genome, ""Haemophilus influenzae"") does not produce entire chromosomes. Instead it generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology). The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the human genome, it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly will usually contain numerous gaps that have to be filled in later. Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today, and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research. Another aspect of bioinformatics in sequence analysis is annotation. This involves computational gene finding to search for protein-coding genes, RNA genes, and other functional sequences within a genome. Not all of the nucleotides within a genome are part of genes. Within the genomes of higher organisms, large parts of the DNA do not serve any obvious purpose. This so-called junk DNA may, however, contain unrecognized functional elements. Bioinformatics helps to bridge the gap between genome and proteome projects — for example, in the use of DNA sequences for protein identification. Genome annotation. In the context of genomics, annotation is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. The first genome annotation software system was designed in 1995 by Owen White, who was part of the team at The Institute for Genomic Research that sequenced and analyzed the first genome of a free-living organism to be decoded, the bacterium ""Haemophilus influenzae"". White built a software system to find the genes (fragments of genomic sequence that encode proteins), the transfer RNAs, and to make initial assignments of function to those genes. Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA, such as the GeneMark program trained and used to find protein-coding genes in ""Haemophilus influenzae"", are constantly changing and improving. Computational evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology is the study of the origin and descent of species, as well as their change over time. Informatics has assisted evolutionary biologists in several key ways; it has enabled researchers to: Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex tree of life. The area of research within computer science that uses genetic algorithms is sometimes confused with computational evolutionary biology, but the two areas are not necessarily related. Literature analysis. The growth in the number of published literature makes it virtually impossible to read every paper, resulting in disjointed sub-fields of research. Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources. For example: The area of research draws from statistics and computational linguistics. Analysis of gene expression. The expression of many genes can be determined by measuring mRNA levels with multiple techniques including microarrays, expressed cDNA sequence tag (EST) sequencing, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) tag sequencing, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), RNA-Seq, also known as ""Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing"" (WTSS), or various applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization. All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate signal from noise in high-throughput gene expression studies. Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous epithelial cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells. Analysis of regulation. Regulation is the complex orchestration of events starting with an extracellular signal such as a hormone and leading to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more proteins. Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process. For example, promoter analysis involves the identification and study of sequence motifs in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA. Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare microarray data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the cell cycle, along with various stress conditions (heat shock, starvation, etc.). One can then apply clustering algorithms to that expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example, the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented regulatory elements. Examples of clustering algorithms applied in gene clustering are k-means clustering, self-organizing maps (SOMs), hierarchical clustering, and consensus clustering methods such as the Bi-CoPaM. The later, namely Bi-CoPaM, has been actually proposed to address various issues specific to gene discovery problems such as consistent co-expression of genes over multiple microarray datasets. Analysis of protein expression. Protein microarrays and high throughput (HT) mass spectrometry (MS) can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample. Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected. Analysis of mutations in cancer. In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genome sequences and germline polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as oligonucleotide microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called comparative genomic hybridization), and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect known ""point mutations"". These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate terabytes of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or noise, and thus Hidden Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes. Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found to be recurrent among many tumors. Comparative genomics. The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between genes (orthology analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectra of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and approximation algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian analysis of problems based on probabilistic models. Many of these studies are based on the homology detection and protein families computation. Network and systems biology. Network analysis seeks to understand the relationships within biological networks such as metabolic or protein-protein interaction networks. Although biological networks can be constructed from a single type of molecule or entity (such as genes), network biology often attempts to integrate many different data types, such as proteins, small molecules, gene expression data, and others, which are all connected physically and/or functionally. Systems biology involves the use of computer simulations of cellular subsystems (such as the networks of metabolites and enzymes which comprise metabolism, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. Artificial life or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms. High-throughput image analysis. Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content biomedical imagery. Modern image analysis systems augment an observer's ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving accuracy, objectivity, or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both diagnostics and research. Some examples are: Structural bioinformatic approaches. Prediction of protein structure. Protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics. The amino acid sequence of a protein, the so-called primary structure, can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the bovine spongiform encephalopathy – a.k.a. Mad Cow Disease – prion.) Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. For lack of better terms, structural information is usually classified as one of ""secondary"", ""tertiary"" and ""quaternary"" structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. Most efforts have so far been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time. One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of homology. In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene ""A"", whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene ""B,"" whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share A's function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called homology modeling, this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably. One example of this is the similar protein homology between hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes (leghemoglobin). Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Though both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes. Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and ""de novo"" (from scratch) physics-based modeling. ""See also:"" structural motif and structural domain. Molecular Interaction. Efficient software is available today for studying interactions among proteins, ligands and peptides. Types of interactions most often encountered in the field include – Protein–ligand (including drug), protein–protein and protein–peptide. Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational algorithms, termed docking algorithms for studying molecular interactions. ""See also:"" protein–protein interaction prediction. Docking algorithms. In the last two decades, tens of thousands of protein three-dimensional structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography and Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (protein NMR). One central question for the biological scientist is whether it is practical to predict possible protein–protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without doing protein–protein interaction experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the Protein–protein docking problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field. Software and tools. Software tools for bioinformatics range from simple command-line tools, to more complex graphical programs and standalone web-services available from various bioinformatics companies or public institutions. Open-source bioinformatics software. Many free and open-source software tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s. The combination of a continued need for new algorithms for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative ""in silico"" experiments, and freely available open code bases have helped to create opportunities for all research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics and the range of open-source software available, regardless of their funding arrangements. The open source tools often act as incubators of ideas, or community-supported plug-ins in commercial applications. They may also provide ""de facto"" standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of bioinformation integration. The range of open-source software packages includes titles such as Bioconductor, BioPerl, Biopython, BioJava, BioRuby, Bioclipse, EMBOSS, .NET Bio, Taverna workbench, and UGENE. In order to maintain this tradition and create further opportunities, the non-profit Open Bioinformatics Foundation have supported the annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) since 2000. Web services in bioinformatics. SOAP- and REST-based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms, data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world. The main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads. Basic bioinformatics services are classified by the EBI into three categories: SSS (Sequence Search Services), MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment), and BSA (Biological Sequence Analysis). The availability of these service-oriented bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web-based bioinformatics solutions, and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data format under a single, standalone or web-based interface, to integrative, distributed and extensible bioinformatics workflow management systems. Bioinformatics workflow management systems. A Bioinformatics workflow management system is a specialized form of a workflow management system designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow, in a Bioinformatics application. Such systems are designed to Currently, there are at least four platforms giving this service: Galaxy, Kepler, Taverna and Anduril. Rosalind. Rosalind is an educational resource and web project for learning bioinformatics through problem solving and computer programming. Rosalind users learn bioinformatics concepts through a problem tree that builds up biological, algorithmic, and programming knowledge concurrently. Each problem is checked automatically, allowing for the project to also be used for automated homework testing in existing classes.

It is often used in Japanese cuisine, such as a topping for ""sekihan"". It is also sometimes sprinkled over plain rice or ""onigiri"". Some commercially sold gomashio also has sugar mixed in with the salt. The sesame seeds used to make ""gomashio"" may be either tan or black in color. They are toasted before being mixed with the salt. Occasionally the salt is also toasted. The ratio of sesame seeds to salt varies according to taste and diet, generally ranging between 5:1 (5 parts sesame seeds to 1 part salt) and 15:1. ""Gomashio"" is often homemade, though it is also commercially available in glass or plastic containers. ""Gomashio"" is also a part of the macrobiotic diet, where it is used as a healthier alternative to ordinary salt. Generally, the ""gomashio"" used in macrobiotic cuisine will contain less salt than traditional Japanese ""gomashio"" (a ratio of 18 parts sesame seeds to 1 part salt is recommended for some individuals with a particularly restricted diet) and made by hand grinding in a suribachi.

wikipedia-8427779," Armenian Air Force  The Armenian Air Force () is the air arm formed by independent Armenia in 1992 in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It is organized and equipped principally to provide Armenian ground forces with tactical air support in the form of ground attack and airlift in mountainous terrain. It provided effective support during the battles with Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh region from 1992–1994, albeit without much fanfare. It currently lacks air superiority fighters, but air defense is provided by MiG-29s of the Russian Air Force under a military cooperation treaty. Since 2003, the Armenian government has been funding a modernization and enlargement of the air fleet. History. Although Armenia began working to establish an independent Armenian armed forces as early as 1989, due to a lack of resources, suitably trained personnel and useful infrastructure, the government delayed formally creating an air force until August 1992, and commenced combat operations in October. However, this may not represent the first use of armed aircraft by the Armenians; an Azeri report states that the Armenians allegedly used modified civilian Mi-8 helicopters for bombing civilian targets in the Geranboi region of Azerbaijan in January 1990. The Azeris also claimed Armenian Mi-24 attack helicopters were employed in support of an assault on Shusha in February 1992. Azerbaijani helicopter gunships were also used in fighting in the region. According to its December 1992 declaration for the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, Armenia had inherited only three operational combat aircraft and at least 13 armed helicopters from the former Soviet Union, along with a portion of its air defense network. The armed helicopter came from the former 7th Guards Helicopter Regiment and were taken over in 1991. The identities of the three combat aircraft are uncertain, but may have included one MiG-25 interceptor and two Su-25 ground-attack aircraft, probably from the former Soviet 80th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment (Russian: 80-й истребительно-бомбардировочный авиаполк (ИБАП)) at Sitalçay air base in Azerbaijan; the helicopter force comprised Mi-8 transport and Mi-24 attack versions that had been based near Yerevan, Armenia. Other aircraft reportedly taken over by the Armenians in 1991 include six An-2, one An-24 and one An-32 transports, as well as ten Yak-52 trainers. Territorial conflicts with Azerbaijan instigated a major expansion of Armenia’s air and air defense forces in 1993–1994. The bulk of Armenia’s aviation-related investment, however, went to greatly strengthening the Armenian Air Defense organization. With Russian technical assistance and contributions of anti-aircraft weapons and equipment, within a year Armenia was able to integrate most of the Soviet radars and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) left in its territory into a coherent and effective air defense system, which it officially declared operational in April 1994. Aircraft additions were few, but by the end of 1994 the Armenian Air Force’s inventory had reached an estimated 5–6 operational Su-25s (one has long been non-operational) and possibly one MiG-25 combat aircraft; two L-39 and ten Yak-52 trainers; six An-2, two An-72, one Tu-134, one Tu-154 transport aircraft; and two Mi-2, seven Mi-8/Mi-17, 15 Mi-24 helicopters. To help redress its relative military weaknesses compared to Azerbaijan and Turkey, on 16 March 1995 Armenia signed a treaty with Russia giving the latter a 25-year-long military presence in Armenia. A follow-on agreement defining terms and conditions was signed 27 September 1996 which authorized the establishment of Russian bases at Gyumri and Yerevan. Russian aviation forces in Armenia comprise 18 MiG-29 fighters of the 426th Fighter Squadron [""426 Istrebitel’naya Aviatsionnaya Eskadril’ya (426 IAE)""] and the 700th Air Traffic Control Center, both at the 3624th Air Base [""3624 Aviatsionnaya Baza (3624 AB)""] at Erebuni Airport outside Yerevan. Russian MiG-29s arrived in four separate batches: five on 16 December 1998, five on 26 February 1999, four more on 18 June and the final four on 22 October 1999. This serial deployment of Russian aircraft to their Armenian base was initially misinterpreted as deliveries to the Armenian Air Force. The Russian MiG-29s may have supplanted an earlier deployment of MiG-23 fighters, as there have been unconfirmed reports of the latter being in service around that time, with the combined number of MiG-23s and MiG-29s at Yerevan possibly reaching as many as 30 aircraft. (There have also been unsubstantiated rumors of Armenian MiG-23 receipts.) The Armenian Air Force experienced a major expansion and modernization in 2004–2005. It tripled its fixed-wing combat arm through the procurement of ten surplus Su-25 from Slovakia for a total of US$1 million in August 2004. These twenty-year-old aircraft – which had not been flown for a decade and required work to re-certify their flightworthiness – were delivered in September 2005. The Su-25 receipt was also originally mis-reported as an acquisition of ten Su-27 air superiority fighters, an aircraft the Slovak Air Force never operated. Also in 2004, Armenia received a pair of L-39C trainers from each of Russia and the Ukraine, as well as two Il-76 transports from Russia in May. Recently, there have been unverified reports that Armenia received up to ten Su-27 from Russia in 2006. This may have been presaged by an Azeri source which reported in October 2005 that Armenia had bought ""10 fighter jets"", but that, according to Azeri military sources, only 2–3 of the aircraft were Su-27; the remainder were purportedly Su-25 jets and Mi-24 attack helicopters. Ostensibly, these would have been procured on preferential terms under the provisions of the 2002 Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) agreement. To date, however, there has been no confirmation of the receipt of any of these aircraft, and it is possible that any appearance of Su-27s in Armenia may have been a deployment of Russia’s own aircraft to its airbase at Yerevan. (It has also been pointed out that the Soviets never based Su-27s in Transcaucasia because it was too difficult an environment for them to operate in. Armenia’s small size limits operational maneuver room and makes it difficult for them to climb to sufficient altitude.) Major operations. Nagorno-Karabakh War. Although Armenia began taking over Soviet weapons shortly following the collapse of the USSR in 1991, it would not be until October 1992 that its nascent air force was able to conduct offensive combat operations. Until then, Armenia was entirely reliant on the Russian Air Force for all air support in the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Armenia suffered its first combat loss on 12 November 1992 when an Mi-24 gunship operating in support of the Armenians’ Martuni Offensive was shot down near the village of Kazakh. On 23 November two Mi-8 transports were hit by groundfire, downing one and seriously damaging another; another Mi-8 was lost on 30 December. The Azeris initiated a new offensive on 1 January 1993 which was successful in cutting the Lachin corridor the following day, thereby isolating Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh from resupply from Armenia proper. The Armenian Air Force helped bring up reinforcements for a counterattack that began 7 January. The first day of this action, the Armenian Air Force suffered its worst single-day losses with an Mi-8, Mi-24 and a (possibly Russian) Su-25 shot down; the Su-25 may have been brought down by friendly fire. By the time the Azeri attack had been defeated at the end of the month, another three helicopters and possibly another fighter – reportedly a MiG-21 (and therefore probably Russian) – would be lost. In late March 1993, the Armenians kicked off a new offensive in the north aimed at opening a second supply route from Armenia. Operation Kelbajar involved a four-prong attack which was successful in routing Azerbaijan’s 2nd Army Corps and securing control of the region. Armenian Air Force losses for amounted to one Mi-8 helicopter (on 16 April). No aircraft losses were suffered during the subsequent summer offensives of 1993 or in the next year’s actions preceding the ceasefire of 16 May 1994. Organization. Little information has been made public about the Armenian Air Force’s organization. It is known that the Air Force operates within a joint Air and Air Defense Force structure, and in 2004 the Air Force comprised four functional units: the 121st Ground Attack Aviation Squadron [""121 Shturmovoy Aviatsionnaya Eskadril’ya (121 ShAE)""], based at Gyumri; 15th Mixed Aviation Regiment [""15 Smeshanniy Aviatsionniy Polk (15 SAP)""], a composite helicopter squadron based at Yerevan; a VIP transport unit probably based at Yerevan; and the 60th Aviation Training Squadron [""60 Uchebniy Aviatsionnaya Eskadril’ya (60 UAE)""], a training center at Arzni. As a result of a series of defense cooperation treaties beginning with the Commonwealth of Independent States’ (CIS) 1992 “Tashkent” Collective Security Treaty (CST) treaty (which was expanded into the CSTO in 2002) and the Russian-Armenian treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed 29 August 1997, Armenian and Russian air and air defense forces are closely integrated. The 1997 friendship treaty, in particular, provides for mutual assistance in the event of a military threat to either party – which goes further than the CSTO security pact – and also allows Russian border guards to patrol Armenia’s frontiers with Turkey and Iran. Armenia regularly participates in bilateral military exercises with forces from Russia’s Group of Forces in the Transcaucasus (GRVZ), and the Armenian Air Force also participates in the CSTO’s annual air defense exercises. Air Defense Force. The Air Defence Force is part of the joint Armenian Air Force and Air Defence, part of the larger Armed Forces of Armenia. It was equipped and organized as part of the military reform program of Ter-Grigoriants. Armenian Air Defence forces comprise an anti-aircraft missile brigade and two regiments armed with 100 missile launchers of mostly Soviet and now Russian manufacture. The Russian Chief of the General Staff, General Vladimir Mikhaylov, said: “On the one hand, Armenia’s national system of air defence makes us happy,” said. “On the other, we will keep helping you, including with means and forces existing at the Russian military base No. 102 which is stationed here.” Airbases. Armenia’s main airbases are located at Erebuni Airport in Yerevan and Shirak Airport in Gyumri, with the addition of a training base at Arzni. Equipment. The Conventional Forces Europe (CFE) treaty limits Armenia to 100 fixed-wing combat aircraft and 50 attack helicopters. Fixed-wing aircraft. Note: Several other aircraft types have been reported from time to time as in Armenian service, but their actual use has been unconfirmed to date by reliable independent sources. Recruitment, training and military education. In the summer of 1993, the Armenian Air Force had a personnel strength of 2,000; this had grown to 3,000 by 2004. Originally dependent on small numbers of returning experienced Armenian military personnel, reservists, conscripts, and contract foreign nationals, during 1993–1994 Armenia established its own military institutions from scratch, among which were its own aviation vocational institute at Yerevan and related training facilities. It remains reliant on conscripts, who serve for 24 months, but also employs volunteers on a contract basis with terms of 3–15 years. Pilots and technical personnel begin their training at the Military Aviation Institute in Yerevan, which was established in 1993. Pilot candidates undertake a basic and primary flying training course which includes 80 hours on the Yak-52 and is followed by 60 hours of jet conversion and advanced training on the L-39. This training is conducted at the airbase at Arzni (sometimes misidentified as Areni), a former Soviet DOSAAF base located northeast of Yerevan. In 2005, the facility also operated a single Yak-18 aerobatic trainer for drop training of paratroopers. A pair of Mi-2 helicopters were also kept available for training helicopter air crews. Type conversion and advanced tactical training are conducted at operational units. "
wikipedia-913740," Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross  Characters. Other characters. (Daisuke Gōri): The supreme general of the Southern Cross. A megalomaniac determined on wiping out the Zor at any cost, he begins to take extreme measures to ensure victory. His policies are heavily criticized by General Emerson. , and (Hirotaka Suzuoki): The leaders of the Zor. , , (Noriko Hidaka): The triplet sirens whose music inspires the Zor people. Musica begins doubting her people's ways and, after meeting Bowie, escapes the mother ship and defects to Glorie. She and Bowie quickly fall in love, and then flee into the woods to escape capture by Lana. Background. The world of Glorie was founded by the human race in an effort to find new worlds for humanity because the Earth had become uninhabitable as a result of a catastrophic nuclear holocaust. Relay stations have been established at Mars and Jupiter, and as a result the planet ""Liberté"" located in the Proxima solar system was colonized. The next planet, Glorie, was discovered in the Epsilon Eridani system. Similar in planetary scale and atmospheric conditions to Earth, Glorie still had an unexpectedly harsh natural environment. The planet has an elliptical orbit around the sun, with a cycle of 73 years. Sixty percent of the planet's surface area is land, and in the winter, fifty percent of that land is covered with glaciers. Originally the planetary temperatures in winter averaged between . Thanks to extensive military terraforming, Glorie was successfully turned into a suitable planet for terrestrial life. The government of Glorie is independent from that of Liberté but is an ally to that planet. In the year 2120 (when this story takes place), Glorie is now a self-sufficient planet in terms of food and resources. Southern Cross Army. The military organization (referred to as the Southern Cross Army) is under the jurisdiction of its prime minister. The units are divided among the land/sea forces and the aerospace force. There are also military police and security forces which are independent, but directly affiliated with Supreme General Headquarters. Headquarters are located in every major city. In the Southern Cross, each unit has a specialized vehicle for combat campaigns. Among them are: ATAC-01-SCA Spartas: It is a one-manned transformable hover vehicle used exclusively by the Alpha Tactics Armored Corps (ATAC). Each Spartas has the ability to transform into 3 modes: Hover (Sniping Clapper), GERWALK (Walking Cannon), and Robot (Battle Sniper). Models differ depending on the rank of the individual. TASC-01-SCF Logan: The Logan is a transformable aerial assault mecha used exclusively by the Tactics Armored Space Corps (TASC). The mecha has two modes: Fighter (Flying Cat) mode for high-speed flying combat and GERWALK (Flying Walker) mode suited for near ground assaults. The fighter has the ability to cover great distances. TASC-02-SCF Auroran: The Auroran was a late development during the war, that was constructed to replace the Logan. It has the capability to transform into three different modes: Fighter (Crusader), Heavy Combat Helicopter (Cross Fighter), and Robot (Cosmo Sniper). The new Robot mode was specifically designed to deal with the Zor Bioroid threat. Sylphide: The Sylphide is a fighter used by the Tactics Air Force. This fighter can also be distinguished by a center tail as well as vertical surfaces mounted in the middle of each wing. The weaponry of the Sylphide includes two guns in the fuselage and four missile hardpoints (two on the outside of either lower engine nacelle). Garm: The Southern Cross Glorie Military Police uses this mecha fielded exclusively for it. The unit is capable of identifying personnel and recording evidence in investigations. Its systems have access to the military legal code to assist in determining if the law has been broken. Salamander: The Strategic Corps uses the Salamander robot as their main combat robot for high-mobility heavy-weapons support. The arms have reinforced armor to assist in parrying attacks. There is a thruster in the rear to assist the mecha in leaping. Personal Armor. Every soldier of the Southern Cross Army is issued a personal combat suit known as an ""arming doublet."" The suit not only acts as protective armor but also improves combat performance. Each suit is equipped to serve different functions and can be altered depending on the mission requirements and needs of each division and rank. All suits are personally tailored for the physique of the individual, resulting in high mobility. Some variants of the arming doublet also have the ability to serve as self-sealed spacesuits. Zor. The are a race who serve as the antagonists for the Southern Cross Army. The Zor were the former inhabitants of the planet Glorie, but they had to evacuate due to an apocalyptic war. Their advances in biotechnology surpass that of humanity, and the weapons they employ called ""Bioroids"" serve as a formidable enemy to the units of the Southern Cross. They operate in groups of three. Each member is responsible for one of three functions: information, decision and action. As a whole, they present a powerful threat, but if one member is lost to the group, then they lose their stability and become unable to function. Characteristically, the Zor are human in appearance, tall and slender with violet eyes, silvery hair and pale skin. The Zor have a symbiotic relationship with a flower native to Glorie referred to as the Protozor, which, like them, exist in trinities. Bioroids. Since the Zor are not a race suited for combat, they employ biohumans to act as soldiers on their behalf. Biohumans are abducted personnel from the armies of the Southern Cross and Liberté forces who are brainwashed and forced to pilot the Bio-engineered mecha created by the Zor supreme commanders. The most impressive feature of Bioroid technology is the ability to convey the thoughts of the operator directly to the mecha. This increases the response promptness, making the Bioroids movements extremely more agile that those of the Southern Cross Mechas. In short the Bioroids are actually ""alive"" with the pilots acting as their ""brains"". The tactical advantage of the alien forces serves the Zor in two ways: (1) the use of the Bioroid serves as a superior fighter over the Southern Cross mecha, and (2) the use of biohumans serves as a psychological deterrent, as the human soldiers find they are fighting their fellow comrades at arms. During the time of the conflict, many variations of the Bioroid were implemented by the Zor in order to adapt to the ever-changing battle conditions experienced on the field. Production. This show was the third mecha anime series released under the ""Super Dimension"" moniker by the sponsor Big West in 1984. This science fiction mecha series followed two other series created by Studio Nue with Artland: ""Super Dimension Fortress Macross"" (1982–1983), produced by Tatsunoko, and ""Super Dimension Century Orguss"" (1983–1984), produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha. Unlike the previous two series, ""Southern Cross"" was created and produced almost entirely by Tatsunoko, with mechanical designs by its sister studio Ammonite. The series lasted for 23 episodes. The three titles share some of the same creators, and ""Macross"" is referenced by character cameos and inside references by the latter two series. However, the basic stories are unrelated. ""Southern Cross"" was the least successful installment of the ""Super Dimension"" brand, and was ultimately canceled due to low ratings, forcing the scriptwriters to hastily conclude the series. "
wikipedia-501402," Shannon Lucid  Shannon Matilda Wells Lucid (born January 14, 1943) is an American biochemist and a retired NASA astronaut. At one time, she held the record for the longest duration stay in space by an American, as well as by a woman. She has flown in space five times including a prolonged mission aboard the Mir space station. Early life and education. Lucid was born in Shanghai, China, to Baptist missionary parents Oscar and Myrtle Wells, but grew up in Bethany, Oklahoma and graduated from Bethany High School. She attended the University of Oklahoma and obtained a Ph.D. in biochemistry from that school in 1973. She is married to Michael F. Lucid of Indianapolis, Indiana and they have two daughters and one son, and five granddaughters and one grandson. Academic career. Lucid's experience includes a variety of academic assignments, such as teaching assistant at the University of Oklahoma's Department of Chemistry from 1963 to 1964; senior laboratory technician at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation from 1964 to 1966; chemist at Kerr-McGee, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 1966 to 1968; graduate assistant at the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center's Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from 1969 to 1973 and research associate with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, from 1974 until her selection to the astronaut candidate training program. NASA career. Lucid was selected for the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1978. Of the six women in this first class with female astronauts, Lucid was the only one who was a mother at the time of being selected. Lucid's first space flight was in June 1985 on Space Shuttle Discovery's mission STS-51-G. She also flew on shuttle missions STS-34 in 1989, STS-43 in 1991, and STS-58 in 1993. Lucid is best known for her fifth spaceflight, when she spent 188 days in space, from March 22 to September 26, 1996, including 179 days aboard ""Mir"", the Russian space station. Both to and from Mir, she travelled on Space Shuttle Atlantis, launching on STS-76 and returning on STS-79. Her stay on Mir was not expected to last so long but her return was delayed twice, extending her stay by about six weeks. During the mission she performed numerous life science and physical science experiments. As a result of her time aboard Mir, she held the record for the most hours in orbit by a non-Russian and most hours in orbit by a woman. On June 16, 2007, her record for longest duration spaceflight by a woman was exceeded by Sunita Williams aboard the International Space Station. From 2002 to 2003, Lucid served as the Chief Scientist of NASA. Starting in 2005, Lucid served as lead CAPCOM (capsule communicator) on the Planning (overnight) shift in Mission Control for a number of Space Shuttle missions, including: STS-114, STS-116, STS-118, STS-120, STS-122, STS-124, STS-125, STS-126, STS-127, STS-128, STS-129, STS-130, STS-132, STS-133, STS-134 and STS-135.  On January 31, 2012, Lucid announced her retirement from NASA. Spaceflights. STS-51G Discovery (June 17 to June 24, 1985) was a 7-day mission, during which the crew deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat) and the United States (AT&T Telstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite, which performed 17 hours of x-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials and participated in biomedical experiments. The mission was accomplished in 112 orbits of the Earth, traveling 2.5 million miles in 169 hours and 39 minutes. Landing was at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB), California. STS-34 Atlantis (October 18 to October 23, 1989) was a 5-day mission during which the crew deployed the Galileo spacecraft, on its journey to explore Jupiter, operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone and performed numerous secondary experiments involving radiation measurements, polymer morphology, lightning research, microgravity effects on plants and a student experiment on ice crystal growth in space. The mission was accomplished in 79 orbits of the Earth, traveling 1.8 million miles in 119 hours and 41 minutes. Landing was at Edwards Air Force Base, California. STS-43 Atlantis (August 2 to August 11, 1991) was a 9-day mission, during which the crew deployed the fifth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-E).

wikipedia-1504783," Robert Fleming & Co.  Robert Fleming & Co. was an asset manager and merchant bank founded in Dundee, Scotland, in 1873. In 1909 the firm moved its headquarters to London. It was sold to Chase Manhattan Bank for over $7 billion in 2000.  Flemings was a 50% partner in the highly successful Asian investment bank Jardine Fleming. At its height in 1997, Robert Fleming Holdings reported over 8,000 employees and operations in 44 countries. History. The firm of Robert Fleming & Co., known as Flemings, was founded in Dundee, Scotland in 1873 by Robert Fleming, a successful manufacturer of jute fabrics used for sandbags in the American Civil War. The firm was originally formed as a series of investment trusts, pooling money from Scottish investors into overseas ventures, and later moved into merchant banking. In 1909 the firm moved its headquarters to London. American railroads. In 1873, Robert Fleming cofounded the Scottish American Investment Company for the purpose of investing in high risk, high return American railroad bonds. The Scottish Widows was a significant early investor. In 1876, Flemings represented the bondholders' committee of the Erie Railway, then under the control of Jay Gould, and saw its plan for the financial reorganisation of the railroad largely adopted. Due to the successful Erie experience, and in its role as a significant railroad investor, Flemings was involved in the successful restructuring of numerous other North American railroads in the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s. Each restructuring produced significant gains for the Fleming investment trusts and drew more investors. Flemings assumed a central role in the 1886 battle with Jay Gould for control of the Texas & Pacific Railway, in which the Flemings bondholder group ultimately triumphed. Overall, Flemings claimed to have made a 40% return on investments in US railroads. By 1900, opportunities in railroads had subsided and Flemings largely left North America. In the 1990s, it entered into a US asset management venture with T. Rowe Price, a large US mutual fund company. Expansion in Asia and Africa. In the twentieth century, Flemings focusing its overseas energies on Asia and Africa. In 1971, Flemings opened a Tokyo office and in 1988 opened an office in Bangkok. After 1970, most of its Asian activities were conducted through Jardine Fleming (see next section). In addition, Flemings was a major player in Africa, particularly in the mining industry. As apartheid drew to a close, Flemings opened offices in southern Africa (Fleming Martin in South Africa, Edwards & Co. in Zimbabwe, and Stockbrokers Botswana in that country). It advised Glencore in its move from Johannesburg to London, where it was listed in 1997, as well as a similar move by Billiton (later BHP Billiton), which became a constituent of the FTSE 100 in 1997. Relationship with Jardine Matheson. In 1970, Flemings entered into an investment banking joint venture with Hong Kong based Jardine Matheson, forming Jardine Fleming. The tie-up was prompted by the long-standing family links between the Flemings and the Keswick family of Scotland, who have run Jardine Matheson since its founding. Flemings at the end of its days. In 1997, Robert Fleming Holdings had operations in 44 countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Americas and Africa. Its net assets as for the 1997 fiscal year were ÂŁ841 million and its profit before tax for the year was ÂŁ136.1 million. Its global asset management business managed ÂŁ63 billion on behalf of institutional and private investors around the world. These results included Jardine Fleming, which in its own right had operations in fifteen countries in the Asia-Pacific region, seats on twenty stock exchanges and some US$19.7 billion in funds under management. Jardine Flemingâs profit before tax for the year was US$41.4 million. The firmâs significant transactions included the privatization of state-owned Pakistan Telecommunication Co. Ltd. in 1994. Through its history, the firm wore its Scottishness on its sleeve. In addition to being controlled by the Scottish Fleming family, there were other signs of its Scots heritage. A bagpipe player regularly greeted visitors at its London headquarters until 2000. In the 1990s, its main non-Fleming family backers were Scottish institutions such as Baillie Gifford and Stewart Ivory. The firm also owned the most extensive private collection of Scottish art in existence, removed to an art foundation, The Fleming-Wyfold Art Foundation, created to protect the art works and prevent any buyers of the failing bank from selling off the collection. Scandal, crisis and restructuring. The Fleming name was tarnished by a scandal in 1996, when Jardine Fleming was ordered to pay $19 million to fund investors for alleged abusive and unsupervised securities allocation practices by asset management head Colin Armstrong. The 1997 Asian crisis severely hit both Robert Fleming and Jardine Fleming. Robert Fleming was forced to approve massive lay offs in late 1998. The firm restructured in 1999, buying the remaining fifty percent stake in Jardine Flemings in return for giving Jardine Matheson an eighteen percent stake in Robert Flemings Holdings. However, despite these efforts, Flemings continued to see its investment banking and asset management market share decline as global investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Lazard moved into their markets. Sale to Chase. In April, 2000, Robert Flemings Holdings was sold to Chase Manhattan Bank for $7.7 billion. Although the sale came about as partially as a result of Flemingsâ weakened position, it was part of two larger trends: consolidation in the financial services industry as large US commercial banks acquired investment banks upon the repeal of the GlassâSteagall Act, and the sale of UK merchant banks to foreign banks. Flemings, with almost no US assets, was considered a particularly good fit for increasingly globally minded Chase, whose assets lay largely in the United States. In the sale about 130 Fleming family members pocketed approximately $2.3 billion for their thirty percent stake. When Chase merged with J.P. Morgan & Co. in 2001, the Flemings asset management business was rebranded J.P. Morgan Fleming, and Fleming Premier Banking was sold to Abbey National's Cater Allen subsidiary. After 2000. The members of the Fleming family have since set up an asset management company, Fleming Family & Partners, chaired by former Morgan Grenfell head John Craven. In 2005, they sold twenty percent of the business to Standard Chartered Bank, a venerable Hong Kong institution like Jardine Matheson, for ÂŁ45 million. The bank business of Jardine Fleming was bought by Standard Bank, a large South African bank, in 2001. "
wikipedia-3459777," Time base correction  Time base correction is a technique to reduce or eliminate errors caused by mechanical instability present in analog recordings on mechanical media. Without time base correction, a signal from a videotape recorder (VTR) or videocassette recorder (VCR) cannot be mixed with other, more time stable devices found in television studios and post-production facilities. Most broadcast quality VCRs have simple time base correctors built in though external time base correctors (""TBC""s) are often used. Time base correction counteracts errors by buffering the video signal and releasing it at a steady rate. ""TBC""s also allow a variable delay in the video stream. By adjusting the rate and delay using a waveform monitor and a vectorscope, the corrected signal can now match the timing of the other devices in the system. If all of the devices in a system are adjusted so their signals meet the video switcher at the same time and at the same rate, the signals can be mixed. A single master clock or ""sync generator"" provides the reference for all of the devices' clocks. Video correction. As far back as 1956, professional reel-to-reel audio tape recorders relying on mechanical stability alone had no audible pitch distortion, and no need for time base correction. However, the higher sensitivity of video recordings meant that even the best mechanical solutions still resulted in detectable distortion of the video signals. A video signal consists of picture information but also sync and subcarrier signals which allow the image to be framed up square on the monitor, reproduce colors accurately and, importantly, allow the combination and switching of two or more video signals. Unlike audio, video signals cannot be successfully mixed if they are out of time with each other. Methods. Implicit in the idea of time base correction is that there must be some target time base that the corrector is aiming for. There are two time bases commonly used. The first method is to make the frames, fields and lines come out smoothly and uniformly, at the rates specified by the standards using an oscillator for time reference. The alternative to this method is to align the frames, fields, and lines with some external signal, a procedure called genlocking. Genlocking allows sources that are not themselves genlock-capable to be used with production switchers and A/B roll editing equipment. Stand-alone broadcast model time base correctors typically will genlock the signal to an external sync reference, and also allow the brightness, contrast, chrominance, and color phase (""tint"" or ""hue"") to be adjusted. Some TBCs featured a Drop Out Compensation (DOC) circuit that enabled videotape flaws caused by oxide drop-out to be temporarily corrected. The DOC circuit required dedicated cabling between the videotape player and the TBC in which irregularities were detected in portions of the video image. Previously captured and stored lines of video would then be superimposed over the flawed video lines. A variant of the time base corrector is the frame synchronizer which allows devices that cannot be ""steered"" by an advanced sync signal to also be time base corrected and/or timed into a system. Satellites, microwave transmitters and other broadcast signals as well as consumer VTRs cannot be sent an advance sync signal. A frame synchronizer stores at least a full frame of video. If the buffer over or under fills, the Frame Sync will hold the last good frame of video until another full frame's worth of video is received. Usually this is undetectable to viewers. "
wikipedia-2827137," Sunshine Coast Airport  Sunshine Coast Airport (formerly Maroochydore Airport) is an Australian airport serving Sunshine Coast, Queensland. It is the gateway to holiday destinations such as Noosa, Maroochydore, Mooloolaba and Caloundra. There are direct daily flights to Sydney and Melbourne, with frequent connecting flights to both domestic and international ports. In addition, Air New Zealand serves the city seasonally, with two weekly return flights from Maroochydore to Auckland. The Sunshine Coast Airport is situated at Marcoola north of Maroochydore, and is owned, operated, managed and developed by the Sunshine Coast Regional Council, which assumed the powers of the former Shire of Maroochy. It is the principal airport for the Sunshine Coast and is the only airport in the region capable of servicing jet aircraft operations. History. The Queensland Government granted a parcel of land to the Maroochy Shire Council in 1958 for use as a general aviation airstrip. The first test landing on a grass strip was on 16 August 1959. The airstrip was initially used by the Maroochy Aero Club and Queensland Parachute Club. Maroochy Shire Council funded the construction of a sealed runway, suitable for aircraft up to the Fokker F27 Friendship, which opened on 12 August 1961. With the commencement of regular public transport services, the airstrip was renamed Maroochydore Airport. Lights for night landings were provided in 1974. A terminal building was constructed in 1979. The runway was extended to in 1983 to allow the operation of Fokker F28 Fellowship and BAe 146 regional jets. The runway was upgraded again in 1993 to allow the operation of larger Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 jets. A new terminal building was completed in 1997 and the airport was renamed Sunshine Coast Airport. Today. The Airport supports a number of regular public transport services (with Boeing 737–800 and Airbus A320 aircraft) and a variety of general aviation activities. These activities are in keeping with the increasing demands of tourism, passenger traffic, general aviation and commercial development opportunities and flight training (Aero Dynamic Flight Academy) . The airport handles aircraft movements of around 87,000 per annum, has a capacity of 900,000 passenger movements per annum. In 2009, the airport handled 916,845 passengers making it the 15th busiest airport in Australia. On 3 June 2010, the airport changed its name from 'Maroochydore-Sunshine Coast Airport' to Sunshine Coast Airport and changed its ICAO code from YBMC to YBSU. In February 2012, Air New Zealand announced plans to launch a new twice-weekly between Auckland and Sunshine Coast Airport, to operate seasonally from July to September. This will be the airport's first international services. Sunshine Coast Airport will build customs, immigration and quarantine facilities ahead of the first flight. On 12 November, Air New Zealand had announced that the season will be in extended in 2013, with flights operating from June to October.  As of August 2012, the only scheduled domestic routes are to southern state capitals, Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. These are serviced by Jetstar and Virgin. There are no scheduled flights north or to any other destinations in Queensland. The national carrier Qantas do not service the airport. Terminal/facilities. The airport has one terminal. It has one-storey and thus there are no aerobridges, and passengers must take a short walk on the tarmac to reach their aircraft. The terminal is modern and of high-quality for a regional airport. Each of the three airlines operating have dedicated check-in desks. There are two baggage carousels, TV monitors, a taxi rank, shuttle bus services and hire-car desks. The departure lounge is fairly large, with seating available for about 300 people. Airport transport options. The airport has a range of transport options to and from the airport. The local taxi service is Suncoast Cabs and there are normally plenty of cabs waiting outside the terminal. The main airport shuttle service is run by SunAir. They provide a door to door shuttle transfer to Sunshine Coast hotels and private residences to all suburbs south of the Sunshine Coast Airport including Twin Waters, Maroochydore, Alexandra Headland, Mooloolaba, Kawana, Buderim, Caloundra, Golden Beach and Pelican Waters. For shuttle transfers to Noosa and northern suburbs, Henrys Airport Shuttle offers a similar door-to-door service as well as Quicksilver Limousines operate a door to door service to all suburbs and further afield. There is a car rental desk at the airport near the baggage claim area. The following car hire companies are represented: Avis, Budget, Europcar, Hertz & Thrifty. Highway access and the entrance road to the Sunshine Coast Airport have both recently been upgraded in mid-2010. There are rarely traffic problems into or out of the airport. Local traffic volume is low, flight volume is low and the recent highway upgrades provide more than enough capacity. Runways. The airport has two runways. The longer main runway, 18/36, handles the jets and the shorter runway 12/30 handles general aviation. The airport master plan proposes building a new Runway 13/31 some time before 2020. This would replace the runway 12/30 and allow operation of aircraft larger and with longer range than the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 with minimal impact on nearby residents. Use of wide body aircraft such as Airbus A330 and Boeing 767, 787 would allow direct flights to S.E.Asia, China and Hawaii. "

Maynard rose to success in 2012 when he was nominated for, and subsequently won, MTV's ""Brand New for 2012"" award. His debut single, ""Can't Say No"", was released in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2012. Biography. 1992–2011: Early life and career. Maynard was born in Brighton, England to an office worker mother, Helen and a builder father, Gary. He has a younger brother Jack and a younger sister Anna. Anna has appeared in some of Conor's covers on YouTube, including ""Run"" and ""If I were a girl"". On 19 May 2006, Maynard signed up to online video-sharing website YouTube and uploaded his very first video of him singing ""Breathe"" by fellow British musician Lee Carr. Throughout 2009–present, Maynard uploaded cover versions of songs with rapper and close friend, Anthony ""Anth"" Melo who resides in Virginia. Together they have covered a variety of songs, including: Chris Brown (""Crawl""), Taio Cruz (""Dynamite""), Rihanna (""Only Girl (In the World)""). Maynard was brought to label attention when American singer/songwriter Ne-Yo watched a cover version of his track ""Beautiful Monster"" – who contacted the musician soon afterwards, and Ne-Yo became Maynard's mentor. He signed to EMI/Parlophone and Turn First management. Turn First were responsible for developing the artist. CEO Sarah Stennett told HitQuarters that rather than telling him what songs to sing, they guided him through the songwriting process, finding what music he was listening to and what was inspiring him, and then matched him up with producers The Invisible Men and songwriter Sophie Stern. These sessions eventually resulted in first single ""Can't Say No"". Stennett described the song as: ""a tastemaker track. It sounded like something he was listening to, which was urban radio."" In November 2011, Maynard received a nomination for MTV's ""Brand New for 2012"" award, competing alongside Delilah, Michael Kiwanuka, Lana Del Rey and Lianne La Havas. It was announced on 31 January 2012 that Maynard had been crowned winner of the award, having received approximately 48% of the public vote. February 2012 saw the reveal that Maynard had been signed to label EMI subsidiary, Parlophone in late 2011 and that work would begin in the coming months on his debut studio album, ""Contrast"". Maynard released the music video for his debut single ""Can't Say No"" on 1 March 2012, which by September 2012 had already surpassed fourteen million views. The single was met with positive reviews, with Lewis Corner (of Digital Spy) describing it as """"playful, fun and immediately leaves you wanting another go"""", whilst others compared Maynard to Canadian singer Justin Bieber; both vocally and career-wise. However Conor disputes this claim, saying ""I'm not like Justin Bieber."" but recognises that they both gained popularity from being young and from being found through YouTube. 2012–2013: ""Contrast"". Maynard's debut single, ""Can't Say No"", was released in the United Kingdom on 15 April 2012 – debuting at number two on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending 28 April with 74,792 copies sold. The track also saw chart success in Ireland, where it peaked at number thirteen. On 1 May, Maynard released the album track ""Drowning"" as a free download (instant great) for any fans who pre-ordered the upcoming studio album, ""Contrast"". On 5 May, he performed 'Can't Say No' at the 7th annual edition of the ""TRL Awards"" in Italy. On June 9, 2012, Maynard performed 'Can't Say No' at the Capital Summertime Ball in front of a 80,000 strong crowd. Maynard released his 2nd single, ""Vegas Girl"", on 21 July 2012 in the UK – it debuted and peaked at number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. On 30 July, he released ""Contrast"", which debuted at number 1 on the UK Album Chart on 11 August 2012. The album sold only 17,000 copies in its debut week. Maynard then released the third single from the album ""Turn Around"" which featured Ne-Yo, it peaked at number 8 on the UK singles chart. 2013: 'Take Off' and New Album. It was revealed in June that Maynard would release a book offer fans an insight into his rise to fame titled 'Take Off'. It will be released in October 2013. Maynard is currently gearing up for the release of his second studio album. He has promised a new sound for the album and has confirmed that he has worked with Labrinth and Travie McCoy on the album.

wikipedia-16665223," Ruffin McNeill  Ruffin McNeill (born October 9, 1958) is the head football coach for the East Carolina Pirates. Before being named head coach, McNeill served the Texas Tech Red Raiders as an interim head coach, assistant head coach, special teams coordinator, and linebackers coach. On December 28, 2009, he was named interim head coach of the Red Raiders, following the suspension and later firing of head coach Mike Leach. He served in the position until the hiring of Tommy Tuberville, who subsequently released him as defensive coordinator. Playing career. McNeill was a defensive back for the East Carolina Pirates for four years under then head coach Pat Dye. Three of his years at ECU he was a starter and two he served as team captain. In his first year with the Pirates, McNeill helped East Carolina to the 1976 Southern Conference Championship and a berth to the Independence Bowl two years later. McNeill graduated from East Carolina University in 1980. He later went on to Clemson where he earned a master's degree in counseling. Coaching career. In addition to coaching at the high school level and spending a summer as an intern with the Miami Dolphins under Jimmy Johnson, McNeill has coached 23 seasons at the college level, including seven seasons at Appalachian State, his first job as defensive coordinator. In total, he has been on the coaching staffs at Clemson, Austin Peay State, North Alabama, Appalachian State, UNLV, Fresno State, and Texas Tech. Texas Tech. McNeill began his tenure at Texas Tech in 2000 as a linebackers coach. In 2003, he accepted the role of assistant head coach as well as taking duties of linebackers coach. In 2007, then-defensive coordinator Lyle Setencich stepped down due to ""personal reasons"" after a 49–45 loss to Oklahoma State in which the Texas Tech defense allowed over 600 yards of total offense and three 100 yard rushers. Head coach Mike Leach named McNeill interim defensive coordinator shortly after with eight games remaining in the season. On December 28, 2009, Leach was suspended, and fired two days later, by Texas Tech University over the alleged inappropriate treatment of an injured player. McNeill was named interim head coach, and led the team to a 41–31 victory over the Michigan State Spartans in the 2010 Alamo Bowl before being replaced as head coach by Tommy Tuberville. On January 13, 2010, McNeill was removed from the Texas Tech coaching staff by Tuberville and replaced with James Willis. Defensive improvements. With McNeill at the defensive helm, the Red Raiders' defense improved in every defensive category. Under Setencich, Tech ranked seventh in pass defense, ninth in total defense, and tenth in scoring defense in Big 12 Conference play. In nine games with McNeill, Tech improved to first in pass and total defense and fourth in scoring defense. The Red Raiders forced more punts and allowed fewer rushing and passing yards than they did to begin the season. These vast improvements in the defense led Leach to drop the interim tag and make McNeill the full-time defensive coordinator. East Carolina. On January 21, 2010 it was announced that Ruffin McNeill would be named head football coach at his alma mater, East Carolina, replacing Skip Holtz, who had recently left for head coaching job at the University of South Florida.

Spurs finished 5th in the 2006–07 season where by qualifying for the UEFA Cup. They then progressed to the last 16 of the competition to face PSV Eindhoven after the two rounds and one away goal each, Spurs were finally eliminated 6–5 on penalties. In the FA Cup Spurs were eliminated by Manchester United in the fourth round losing 3–1. This was also the season where Tottenham won the League Cup beating Chelsea 2–1 at Wembley. Pre-season and friendlies. During the 2007 summer transfer period Tottenham added to their squad with recruits Younes Kaboul from AJ Auxerre for £8 million and then record signing Darren Bent at £16.5 million. This was also the season that Spurs acquired Gareth Bale from Southampton for £5 million. Additional signings were Danny Rose from Leeds and Kevin-Prince Boateng from Hertha Berlin. On the way out of the club was Eygptian footballer Mido. He arrived on an 18-month loan deal from Roma in January 2005 and in 2006 signed a permanent deal. Then on 16 August 2007, he was sold to Middlesbrough for £6 million. Also leaving the club was Reto Ziegler who was loaned out to Sampdoria in Italy for the second half of the 2006–07 season. Sampdoria then decided to sign him permanently from Spurs for an undisclosed fee. 2007–08 Season. Tottenham started off their Premier League campaign away at newly promoted Sunderland with a 1–0 loss. Three days later they travelled to Everton losing 3–1, then at White Hart Lane Spurs recorded their first win - 4–0 against Derby County. After that game Martin Jol and Tottenham recorded four draws and three defeats in the Premier League, which included a 3–3 draw away to Fulham and a 4–4 draw against Aston Villa. In the UEFA Cup first round Spurs won 6–1 against the Cypriot team Anorthosis Famagusta, then followed up with a 1–1 draw back in Cyprus. Jol's final league game was on 22 October, Spurs were away at Newcastle United and they lost 3–1. Then on 25 October Spurs were away in Europe at Getafe playing in the UEFA Cup and lost 2–1. When the game was finished it was announced that Jol had been sacked as Manager. After one match with Clive Allen and Alex Inglethorpe in charge, Juande Ramos was employed as Tottenham manager having managed successfully at Sevilla. Alongside Ramos, Gus Poyet was handed the assistant head coach role. Marcos Alvarez who worked alongside Ramos at Sevilla joined the backroom staff as fitness coach. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy was widely criticised for his treatment of Martin Jol following revelations that Juande Ramos was approached to replace Jol during the summer, which many thought undermined his leadership and ruined his credibility as an authoritative figure. Ramos' reign began with a 2–0 win over Blackpool in the League Cup. Immediately following Ramos's appointment it was made clear in the public forum that he was very unhappy with the fitness and weight of the team and instigated a new diet and fitness regime. Tottenham's league form began to improve and Tottenham's progress in the League Cup began with a 2–0 win over Manchester City which ended City's unbeaten home record. On 27 January 2008 Spurs went out of the FA Cup fourth round to a 3–1 defeat at the hands of Manchester United at Old Trafford. Tottenham took the lead through Robbie Keane but eventually lost to United to a goal from Carlos Tévez and two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo one of which was a penalty where Michael Dawson was sent off for a deliberate handball. Tottenham's run in the League Cup continued with a semi-final first leg 1–1 draw against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Followed by a 5–1 win over Arsenal at White Hart Lane, winning 6–2 on aggregate. This booked a place in the final against Chelsea. Tottenham went on to win the match 2-1 thanks to a Jonathan Woodgate header in extra time securing Tottenham's first trophy since 1999. It also guaranteed them UEFA Cup qualification for the third season running. On 13 March, Tottenham were eliminated from the UEFA Cup in the last 16 round by PSV Eindhoven. The first leg played at White Hart Lane was a 1–0 defeat for Spurs following a mistake from Gilberto. Dimitar Berbatov scored in the second leg played at the Philips Stadion, to take the game to extra time and penalties where Tottenham lost 6–5 when Pascal Chimbonda missed during sudden death. On 22 March, Spurs played Portmouth winning 2–0. Darren Bent struck the 100th goal of the 2007–08 season campaign. Jamie O'Hara followed two minutes later with the 101st. BBC sport writer Ian Hughes noted that Tottenham have "" an average of 3.63 goals in every Spurs game this season"". After earning a point on 19 April in a 1–1 draw against Wigan, Tottenham made themselves mathematically safe from relegation with at least 42 points. Berbatov's sixth minute strike was Tottenham's 100th in all competitions that season, 64 in the Premier League and 36 in cup competitions.

wikipedia-2701077," Dynamic-link library  Dynamic-link library (also written unhyphenated), or DLL, is Microsoft's implementation of the shared library concept in the Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension DLL, OCX (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or DRV (for legacy system drivers). The file formats for DLLs are the same as for Windows EXE files — that is, Portable Executable (PE) for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, and New Executable (NE) for 16-bit Windows. As with EXEs, DLLs can contain code, data, and resources, in any combination. Data files with the same file format as a DLL, but with different file extensions and possibly containing only resource sections, can be called ""resource DLLs"". Examples of such DLLs include ""icon libraries"", sometimes having the extension ICL, and font files, having the extensions FON and FOT. Background for DLL. The first versions of Microsoft Windows ran programs together in a single address space. Every program was meant to co-operate by yielding the CPU to other programs so that the graphical user interface (GUI) could multitask and be maximally responsive. All operating system level operations were provided by the underlying operating system: MS-DOS. All higher level services were provided by Windows Libraries ""Dynamic Link Library."" The Drawing API, GDI, was implemented in a DLL called GDI.EXE, the user interface in USER.EXE. These extra layers on top of DOS had to be shared across all running Windows programs, not just to enable Windows to work in a machine with less than a megabyte of RAM, but to enable the programs to co-operate among each other. The Graphics Device Interface code in GDI needed to translate drawing commands to operations on specific devices. On the display, it had to manipulate pixels in the frame buffer. When drawing to a printer, the API calls had to be transformed into requests to a printer. Although it could have been possible to provide hard-coded support for a limited set of devices (like the Color Graphics Adapter display, the HP LaserJet Printer Command Language), Microsoft chose a different approach. GDI would work by loading different pieces of code, called 'device drivers', to work with different output devices. The same architectural concept that allowed GDI to load different device drivers is that which allowed the Windows shell to load different Windows programs, and for these programs to invoke API calls from the shared USER and GDI libraries. That concept was ""dynamic linking."" In a conventional non-shared ""static"" library, sections of code are simply added to the calling program when its executable is built at the ""linking"" phase; if two programs call the same routine, the routine is included in both the programs during the linking stage of the two. With dynamic linking, shared code is placed into a single, separate file. The programs that call this file are connected to it at run time, with the operating system (or, in the case of early versions of Windows, the OS-extension), performing the binding. For those early versions of Windows (1.0 to 3.11), the DLLs were the foundation for the entire GUI. This notion of building up the operating system from a collection of dynamically loaded libraries is a core concept of Windows that persists even today. DLLs provide the standard benefits of shared libraries, such as modularity. Modularity allows changes to be made to code and data in a single self-contained DLL shared by several applications without any change to the applications themselves. Another benefit of the modularity is the use of generic interfaces for plug-ins. A single interface may be developed which allows old as well as new modules to be integrated seamlessly at run-time into pre-existing applications, without any modification to the application itself. This concept of dynamic extensibility is taken to the extreme with the Component Object Model, the underpinnings of ActiveX. In Windows 1.x, 2.x and 3.x, all Windows applications shared the same address space as well as the same memory. A DLL was only loaded once into this address space; from then on, all programs using the library accessed it. The library's data was shared across all the programs. This could be used as an indirect form of inter-process communication, or it could accidentally corrupt the different programs. With the introduction of 32-bit libraries in Windows 95 every process runs in its own address space. While the DLL code may be shared, the data is private except where shared data is explicitly requested by the library. That said, large swathes of Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me were built from 16-bit libraries, which limited the performance of the Pentium Pro microprocessor when launched, and ultimately limited the stability and scalability of the DOS-based versions of Windows. Although DLLs are the core of the Windows architecture, they have several drawbacks, collectively called ""DLL hell"". Microsoft currently promotes .NET Framework as one solution to the problems of DLL hell, although they now promote virtualization-based solutions such as Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Application Virtualization, because they offer superior isolation between applications. An alternative mitigating solution to DLL hell has been implementing side-by-side assembly. Features of DLL. Since DLLs are essentially the same as EXEs, the choice of which to produce as part of the linking process is for clarity, since it is possible to export functions and data from either.  It is not possible to directly execute a DLL, since it requires an EXE for the operating system to load it through an entry point, hence the existence of utilities like RUNDLL.EXE or RUNDLL32.EXE which provide the entry point and minimal framework for DLLs that contain enough functionality to execute without much support. DLLs provide a mechanism for shared code and data, allowing a developer of shared code/data to upgrade functionality without requiring applications to be re-linked or re-compiled. From the application development point of view Windows and OS/2 can be thought of as a collection of DLLs that are upgraded, allowing applications for one version of the OS to work in a later one, provided that the OS vendor has ensured that the interfaces and functionality are compatible. DLLs execute in the memory space of the calling process and with the same access permissions which means there is little overhead in their use but also that there is no protection for the calling EXE if the DLL has any sort of bug. Memory management. In Windows API, the DLL files are organized into ""sections"". Each section has its own set of attributes, such as being writable or read-only, executable (for code) or non-executable (for data), and so on. The code in a DLL is usually shared among all the processes that use the DLL; that is, they occupy a single place in physical memory, and do not take up space in the page file. If the physical memory occupied by a code section is to be reclaimed, its contents are discarded, and later reloaded directly from the DLL file as necessary. In contrast to code sections, the data sections of a DLL are usually private; that is, each process using the DLL has its own copy of all the DLL's data. Optionally, data sections can be made shared, allowing inter-process communication via this shared memory area. However, because user restrictions do not apply to the use of shared DLL memory, this creates a security hole; namely, one process can corrupt the shared data, which will likely cause all other sharing processes to behave undesirably. For example, a process running under a guest account can in this way corrupt another process running under a privileged account. This is an important reason to avoid the use of shared sections in DLLs. If a DLL is compressed by certain executable packers (e.g. UPX), all of its code sections are marked as read and write, and will be unshared. Read-and-write code sections, much like private data sections, are private to each process. Thus DLLs with shared data sections should not be compressed if they are intended to be used simultaneously by multiple programs, since each program instance would have to carry its own copy of the DLL, resulting in increased memory consumption. Import libraries. Like static libraries, import libraries for DLLs are noted by the .lib file extension. For example, kernel32.dll, the primary dynamic library for Windows' base functions such as file creation and memory management, is linked via kernel32.lib. Linking to dynamic libraries is usually handled by linking to an import library when building or linking to create an executable file. The created executable then contains an import address table (IAT) by which all DLL function calls are referenced (each referenced DLL function contains its own entry in the IAT). At run-time, the IAT is filled with appropriate addresses that point directly to a function in the separately loaded DLL. Symbol resolution and binding. Each function exported by a DLL is identified by a numeric ordinal and optionally a name. Likewise, functions can be imported from a DLL either by ordinal or by name. The ordinal represents the position of the function's address pointer in the DLL Export Address table. It is common for internal functions to be exported by ordinal only. For most Windows API functions only the names are preserved across different Windows releases; the ordinals are subject to change. Thus, one cannot reliably import Windows API functions by their ordinals. Importing functions by ordinal provides only slightly better performance than importing them by name: export tables of DLLs are ordered by name, so a binary search can be used to find a function. The index of the found name is then used to look up the ordinal in the Export Ordinal table. In 16-bit Windows, the name table was not sorted, so the name lookup overhead was much more noticeable. It is also possible to ""bind"" an executable to a specific version of a DLL, that is, to resolve the addresses of imported functions at compile-time. For bound imports, the linker saves the timestamp and checksum of the DLL to which the import is bound. At run-time Windows checks to see if the same version of library is being used, and if so, Windows bypasses processing the imports. Otherwise, if the library is different from the one which was bound to, Windows processes the imports in a normal way. Bound executables load somewhat faster if they are run in the same environment that they were compiled for, and exactly the same time if they are run in a different environment, so there's no drawback for binding the imports. For example, all the standard Windows applications are bound to the system DLLs of their respective Windows release. A good opportunity to bind an application's imports to its target environment is during the application's installation. This keeps the libraries 'bound' until the next OS update. It does, however, change the checksum of the executable, so it is not something that can be done with signed programs, or programs that are managed by a configuration management tool that uses checksums (such as MD5 checksums) to manage file versions. As more recent Windows versions have moved away from having fixed addresses for every loaded library (for security reasons), the opportunity and value of binding an executable is decreasing. Explicit run-time linking. DLL files may be explicitly loaded at run-time, a process referred to simply as ""run-time dynamic linking"" by Microsoft, by using the LoadLibrary (or LoadLibraryEx) API function. The GetProcAddress API function is used to look up exported symbols by name, and FreeLibrary — to unload the DLL. These functions are analogous to dlopen, dlsym, and dlclose in the POSIX standard API. The procedure for explicit run-time linking is the same in any language that supports pointers to functions, since it depends on the Windows API rather than language constructs. Delayed loading. Normally, an application that was linked against a DLL’s import library will fail to start if the DLL cannot be found, because Windows will not run the application unless it can find all of the DLLs that the application may need. However an application may be linked against an import library to allow delayed loading of the dynamic library. In this case the operating system will not try to find or load the DLL when the application starts; instead, a stub is included in the application by the linker which will try to find and load the DLL through LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress when one of its functions is called. If the DLL cannot be found or loaded, or the called function does not exist, the application will generate an exception, which may be caught and handled appropriately. If the application does not handle the exception, it will be caught by the operating system, which will terminate the program with an error message. The delay-loading mechanism also provides notification hooks, allowing the application to perform additional processing or error handling when the DLL is loaded and/or any DLL function is called. Compiler and language considerations. Delphi. In the heading of a source file, the keyword library is used instead of program. At the end of the file, the functions to be exported are listed in exports clause. Delphi does not need LIB files to import functions from DLLs; to link to a DLL, the external keyword is used in the function declaration. Microsoft Visual Basic. In Visual Basic (VB), only run-time linking is supported; but in addition to using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress API functions, ""declarations"" of imported functions are allowed. When importing DLL functions through declarations, VB will generate a run-time error if the DLL file cannot be found. The developer can catch the error and handle it appropriately. When creating DLLs in VB, the IDE will only allow you to create ActiveX DLLs, however methods have been created to allow the user to explicitly tell the linker to include a .DEF file which defines the ordinal position and name of each exported function. This allows the user to create a standard Windows DLL using Visual Basic (Version 6 or lower) which can be referenced through a ""Declare"" statement. C and C++. Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) provides several extensions to standard C++ which allow functions to be specified as imported or exported directly in the C++ code; these have been adopted by other Windows C and C++ compilers, including Windows versions of GCC. These extensions use the attribute __declspec before a function declaration. Note that when C functions are accessed from C++, they must also be declared as extern ""C"" in C++ code, to inform the compiler that the C linkage should be used. Besides specifying imported or exported functions using __declspec attributes, they may be listed in IMPORT or EXPORTS section of the DEF file used by the project. The DEF file is processed by the linker, rather than the compiler, and thus it is not specific to C++. DLL compilation will produce both DLL and LIB files. The LIB file is used to link against a DLL at compile-time; it is not necessary for run-time linking. Unless your DLL is a Component Object Model (COM) server, the DLL file must be placed in one of the directories listed in the PATH environment variable, in the default system directory, or in the same directory as the program using it. COM server DLLs are registered using regsvr32.exe, which places the DLL's location and its globally unique ID (GUID) in the registry. Programs can then use the DLL by looking up its GUID in the registry to find its location. Programming examples. Creating DLL exports. The following examples show language-specific bindings for exporting symbols from DLLs. Delphi C Using DLL imports. The following examples show how to use language-specific bindings to import symbols for linking against a DLL at compile-time. Delphi C Make sure you include Example.lib file (assuming that Example.dll is generated) in the project (Add Existing Item option for Project!) before static linking. The file Example.lib is automatically generated by the compiler when compiling the DLL. Not executing the above statement would cause linking error as the linker would not know where to find the definition of AddNumbers. You also need to copy the DLL Example.dll to the location where the .exe file would be generated by the following code. Using explicit run-time linking. The following examples show how to use the run-time loading and linking facilities using language-specific Windows API bindings. Component Object Model. The Component Object Model (COM) defines a binary standard to host the implementation of objects in DLL and EXE files. It provides mechanisms to locate and version those files as well as a language-independent and machine-readable description of the interface. Hosting COM objects in a DLL is more lightweight and allows them to share resources with the client process. This allows COM objects to implement powerful back-ends to simple GUI front ends such as Visual Basic and ASP. They can also be programmed from scripting languages. DLL hijacking. Due to a vulnerability commonly known as DLL hijacking, many programs will load and execute a malicious DLL contained in the same folder as a file on a remote system. The vulnerability was discovered by HD Moore, who has published an exploit for the open-source based penetration testing software, Metasploit. "
wikipedia-1421740," New York hardcore  New York hardcore (NYHC) is hardcore punk and metalcore music created in New York City, and the subculture associated with that music. New York hardcore grew out of the hardcore scene established in Washington, D.C., by bands such as Bad Brains and Minor Threat. It was primarily a phenomenon of the 1980s and '90s. 1980s. New York City played a central role in the development of hardcore. An important scene emerged in 1981 with the emigration of the Bad Brains from Washington, DC. Roger Miret of Agnostic Front asserts that ""We started using the term 'hardcore' because we wanted to separate ourselves from the druggy or artsy punk scene that was happening in New York at the time ... We were rougher kids living in the streets. It had a rougher edge"". The early scene was documented on the 1982 ""New York Thrash"" compilation. Sam McPheeters argues that  McPheeters argues that the scene was inspired and influenced by dystopian films such as ""Death Wish"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Warriors"", and ""Escape From New York"". Many of the mid-1980s NYHC groups were aligned with right-wing ideology. Beginning with Cro-Mags, some groups also followed the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. More leftist groups associated with the scene include Born Against and Nausea. The scene was focused around venues such as the famous CBGBs, ABC No Rio, A7 and Brooklyn's L'amour. The New York scene was home to most of the early influential bands, such as Agnostic Front, Biohazard (band), Beastie Boys, Cro-Mags, Heart Attack, Kraut, Adrenalin O.D., Urban Waste, Sheer Terror, Murphy's Law, Reagan Youth, The Mob, Warzone. Later New York hardcore groups included Sick of It All, Breakdown, Subzero, Gorilla Biscuits, Judge, Bold, and Leeway. 1990s. 1990s NYHC groups included Burn, Merauder, Awkward Thought, Side by Side, Crown of Thornz, Skarhead, Sworn Enemy, H2O, Madball, No Redeeming Social Value, Vatican Commandos and Full Blown Chaos. 2000s-present. New York City hardcore bands to break out nationally since 2000 have mostly been from Long Island and include Backtrack, This Is Hell and Stray from the Path. "

Its main areas of work were dispute resolution, real estate, corporate and employment law. Cobbetts had total revenues of £45.4 million in 2011/12, the 62nd-largest of any UK-based law firm in that financial year. Cobbetts entered administration in January 2013 and in February the bulk of its assets were acquired by rival Manchester-based law firm DWF. History. Cobbetts was originally founded in Manchester during the first half of the nineteenth century as Cobbett, Wheeler and Cobbett by the sons of William Cobbett, the journalist and polemicist. It became Cobbett Leak Almond after the acquisition of Leak Almond and Parkinson in 1987. The firm shortened its name to simply 'Cobbetts' in 1996. Further mergers with Read Hind Stewart of Leeds and Lee Crowder of Birmingham followed in 2002 and 2004 respectively. The London office was opened in 2004 to service corporate clients acquired through niche Manchester firm Fox Brooks Marshall in 2003. On 30 January 2013 it was announced that Cobbetts would be entering administration, having filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators on 28 January 2013, and was now up for sale.

wikipedia-918363," Marcus Allen  Marcus LeMarr Allen (born March 26, 1960) is a former American football running back and football analyst for CBS. As a professional, Allen ran for 12,243 yards and caught 587 passes for 5,412 yards during his career for both the Los Angeles Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs from 1982 to 1997. He scored 145 touchdowns, including a then league record 123 rushing touchdowns, and was elected to six Pro Bowls over the course of his career. He was also a fairly good passer for a running back, completing 12 of 27 passes for 285 yards and six touchdowns, with only one interception. Allen was the first player ever to gain more than 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards during his career.  Allen is considered one of the greatest goal line and short-yard runners in National Football League (NFL) history. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003. His younger brother, Damon Allen, played quarterback for 23 seasons in the Canadian Football League and was professional football's all-time leader in passing yards. Allen is a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy. Allen is a Board Member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Ronnie Lott and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year. High school and college. Allen played football at Abraham Lincoln High School in San Diego, California, where he played the quarterback and safety positions. Allen played running back at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1978 to 1981. He was recruited as a defensive back, but head coach John Robinson switched him to tailback. Allen spent his first season at USC as a backup to Heisman Trophy winning running back Charles White. In 1979, he was moved to fullback. Eventually, in 1980, Allen became the starter at tailback and rushed for 1,563 yards, the third-most in the nation that year (behind senior George Rogers of S. Carolina - 1,781 yards and freshman Herschel Walker of Georgia - 1,616). In 1981, Allen had one of the most spectacular seasons in NCAA history, rushing for 2,342 yards, becoming the first player in NCAA history to rush for over 2,000 yards in one season, passing the 2,000 yard mark in a win at Cal. He also gained a total of 2,683 offensive yards, led the nation in scoring, and won the Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Award, and Walter Camp Award. He was also the Pac-10 Player of the Year. Allen shares the NCAA record for most 200-yard rushing games with Ricky Williams and Ron Dayne, each completing the feat twelve times. Allen finished his four college seasons with 4,682 rushing yards, 5,232 total yards, and 46 touchdowns, while averaging 5.2 yards per carry. USC has retired his jersey number (33), and coach Robinson has called Allen, ""the greatest player I ever saw."" On December 14, 2006, Allen hosted the USC Football Awards banquet at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in Los Angeles. NFL career. Allen was drafted with the 10th overall selection of the 1982 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Raiders. In a recent ad on NFL Network, Allen recalls shortly before being drafted that the Raiders asked him his weight at the time(he answered 200 or 212) and then drafted him soon after. Though his rookie season was shortened by a league strike, Allen rushed for 697 yards and led the Raiders to the best record in the AFC at 8-1. He was voted the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. The Raiders would lose to the New York Jets in the AFC Divisional Playoffs. The next season, Allen broke the 1,000-yard mark for the first time, an accomplishment he would repeat the two following years. During the 1985 season, he rushed for 1,759 yards and scored 11 touchdowns on 380 carries, leading the Raiders to a 12-4 record and the AFC West Division Championship. In addition, Allen was named the NFL MVP. Allen may be best remembered for his heroics in Super Bowl XVIII January 22, 1984 as he ran for 191 yards, caught two passes for 18 yards, and scored two touchdowns in the Raiders 38-9 victory over the Washington Redskins. Included in his stats was a 74-yard touchdown run, a feat that remained the longest run in Super Bowl history until Super Bowl XL when Willie Parker of the Pittsburgh Steelers broke the record by a single yard. Allen's 191 rushing yards were also a Super Bowl record, which stood until Timmy Smith of the Redskins topped it with 204 yards in Super Bowl XXII. Upon winning the game, Allen joined an elite group of players to win both the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP (Roger Staubach, Jim Plunkett, Desmond Howard). Moreover, Allen put together one of the greatest postseasons ever by a NFL running back. On January 1, 1984, Allen gained 121 yards for two touchdowns on just 13 carries against the Pittsburgh Steelers. One week later, Allen rushed 25 times for 154 yards and scored on a touchdown reception. In total, Allen rushed 58 times for 466 yards and four touchdowns during the playoffs. He also added 118 yards and one touchdown on 14 receptions. In future seasons with the Raiders, Allen formed a stormy relationship with owner Al Davis stemming from a contract dispute where Davis referred to Allen as a ""cancer to the team."" He also missed most of the 1989 season with a knee injury. Allen was relegated to back-up duty in his final three seasons with the Raiders and, at one time, fell to fourth on the depth chart. Allen's strained relationship with Davis reached an all-time low in December 1992. During halftime of the Raiders-Dolphins game on Monday Night Football, a taped interview between Al Michaels and Allen was broadcast, with Allen stating that Davis ""told me he was going to get me."" Allen further stated, ""I think he's tried to ruin the latter part of my career, tried to devalue me. He's trying to stop me from going to the Hall of Fame. They don't want me to play."" Allen eventually left Los Angeles and joined the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993. Although he only rushed for 764 yards that year, he scored 12 touchdowns, leading the AFC, as he and Joe Montana led the Chiefs to the AFC Championship Game. As a result, Allen was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. Allen went on to play for the Chiefs for four more seasons, leading the team in rushing every year but his last. Allen's main contribution to the Chiefs was his leadership. The Chiefs won more games than any other NFL team during his tenure in Kansas City. Allen made many contributions to charitable causes off the field in Kansas City, while also hosting his own talk show on Sunday mornings before Chiefs games. Allen retired after the 1997 season. In 1999, he was ranked 72nd on ""The Sporting News""' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Allen was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003. In 1999, Allen was also inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions, Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.[http://www.sdhoc.com/awards/hall-of-fame/football/marcus-allen/] In 2008, Allen joined as a spokesman for the sports website OPENSports.com, the brainchild of Mike Levy, founder and former CEO of CBS Sportsline.com. Allen wrote a blog and occasionally answered member questions for the company during this time. In 2011, Allen led the RioCan Wrecking Crew to a 2-1 record in the Strike out Cancer Baseball Tournament. NFL Records: "
wikipedia-667751," Modernization  Modernization or modernisation refers to a model of an evolutionary transition from a 'pre-modern' or 'traditional' to a 'modern' society. The teleology of modernization is described in social evolutionism theories, existing as a template that has been generally followed by societies that have achieved modernity.  Historians link modernization to the processes of urbanization and industrialisation, as well as to the spread of education. As Kendall (2007) notes, ""Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization."" In sociological critical theory, modernization is linked to an overarching process of rationalisation. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes that much more important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society.  Modernization theory and history have been explicitly used as guides for countries eager to develop rapidly, such as China. Indeed, modernization has been proposed as the most useful framework for World history in China, because as one of the developing countries that started late, ""China's modernization has to be based on the experiences and lessons of other countries."". Instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits usually becomes less important as modernization takes hold. Theory. According to theories of modernization, each society can develop from traditionalism to modernity, and that those that make this transition follow similar paths. More modern states are wealthier and more powerful, and their citizens freer, with a higher standard of living. According to Peter Wagner, modernization can be seen as processes, and as offensives. The former view is commonly projected by politicians and the media, and suggests that it is developments, such as new data technology or need to update traditional methods, which make modernization necessary or preferable. This view makes critique of modernization difficult, since it implies these developments control the limits of human interaction, and not vice versa. It also states that it is purely up to human being to control the speed and severity of modernisation.(KABASO.S.MUYA) The view of modernization as offensives argues that both the developments and the altered opportunities made available by these developments are shaped and controlled by human agents. The view of modernization as offensives therefore sees it as a product of human planning and action, an active process capable of being both changed and criticized Modernization emerged in the late 19th century and was especially popular among scholars in the mid-20th century. One foremost advocate was Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons ""Mandarins of the Future"" (2003) The theory stressed the importance of societies being open to change and saw reactionary forces as restricting development. Maintaining tradition for tradition's sake was thought to be harmful to progress and development. Proponents of modernization lie in two camps, optimists and pessimist. The former view holds that what a modernizer sees as a setback to the theory (events such as the Iranian Revolution or the troubles in Lebanon) are invariably temporary setbacks, with the ability to attain ""modernism"" still existing. Pessimists argue that such non-modern areas are incapable of becoming modern. Practice. United States. The Progressives in the United States in the early 20th century were avid modernizers. They believed in science, technology, expertise—and especially education—as the grand solution to society's weaknesses. Characteristics of progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban-industrial society, belief in mankind's ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, and a belief in the ability of experts and in efficiency of government intervention. Paul Monroe, a professor of history at Columbia University, was a member of The Inquiry—a team of American experts at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He drew on his experience in the Philippines to assess the educational needs of developing areas such as Albania, Turkey and central Africa. Presenting educational development as instrumental to nation-building and socioeconomic development, Monroe recommended the implementation of a progressive curriculum - with an emphasis on practical, adult, and teacher training - in a national system of education, as a basis for self-development, except in Africa. His approach shaped American cooperation with developing countries in the 1920s and modernization efforts during the 1920s-1930s. Germany's ""Sonderweg"". Many historians have emphasized the central importance of a German Sonderweg or ""special path"" (or ""exceptionalism"") as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the 20th century. According to the historiography by Kocka (1988), the process of nation-building from above especially during the period of the German Empire (1871–1918), in the following Weimar era, had very grievous long-term implications, historians have argued. In terms of parliamentary democracy, Parliament was kept weak, the parties were fragmented, and there was a row file level of mutual distrust. The Nazis built on the illiberal, anti-pluralist elements of Weimar's political culture. The Junker elites (the large landowners in the east) and senior civil servants, used their great power and influence well into the twentieth century to frustrate any movement toward democracy. They played an especially negative role in the crisis of 1930-1933. The emphasis by Otto von Bismarck on military force amplified the voice of the officer corps, which combined advanced modernization of military technology with reactionary politics. The rising upper-middle-class elites, in the business, financial, and professional worlds, tended to accept the values of the old traditional elites. The MUYA Empire was, for Hans-Ulrich Wehler, a strange mixture of highly successful capitalist, industrialization and socio-economic modernization on the one hand, and of surviving pre-industrial institutions, power relations and traditional cultures on the other. Wehler argues that it produced a high degree of internal tension, which led on the one hand to the suppression of socialists, Catholics, and reformers, and on the other hand to a highly aggressive foreign policy. For these reasons Fritz Fischer and his students emphasized Germany’s primary guilt for causing World War I. Hans-Ulrich Wehler, a leader of the Bielefeld School of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s-1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus). The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernization of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of ""the middle class"" and ""revolution,"" each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of ""charismatic domination,"" which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler. The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history. Nineteenth century scholars who emphasized a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the ""western path"" typified by Great Britain. The stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a social welfare state. In the 1950s, historians in West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933-1945. The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism. The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in German historiography: the ""long nineteenth century"", the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West. After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg. While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation. 19th century France. In his seminal book ""Peasants Into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1880–1914"" (1976), historian Eugen Weber traced the modernization of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He emphasized the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas. The book was widely praised, but was criticized by some who argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870. Asia. Many studies of modernization have focused on the history of Japan in the late 19th century, and China and India in the late 20th century. For example, the process of borrowing science and technology from the West has been explored. China. China has been attempting to modernize ever since the Revolution of 1911 and the end on the Qing Dynasty, the last dynasty of China. Before the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, it attempted to reform from 1902 to 1908 to save itself and instigated reforms in infrastructure, transportation, and government. These reforms were based on Western models and even included aspects of democracy, which are often associated with the process of modernization. However, these reforms were largely unsuccessful and resulted in the Revolution of 1911. Following the Revolution of 1911, other movements such as the May 4th Movement of 1919 advocated for modernization, iconoclasm, and a rejection of foreign influence and imperialism. From the beginning of the 20th century until the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, China has been delayed in efforts to modernize due to an era of warlordism, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and civil war between the CCP and KMT. When the communist party came to power in 1949, Mao Zedong used the Soviet Union as China’s example for modernization. The Great Leap Forward from 1958-1961 was Mao’s version of the Soviet Union’s Five year Plan, and its goals were to create a modern communist society through industrialization and collectivization. Mao Zedong aimed to become a world power without foreign, mainly western, involvement, ideas, or capitalism and preached the idea of self-reliance. Mao did contribute to the modernization of China, however The Great Leap Forward is regarded as a failure and the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 further prohibited much progress.  The economic reforms of Chinese Supreme Leader Deng Xiaoping are attributed to China’s economic success in the 21st century. Deng focused on four modernizations: agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. The West was used as an example for several of these modernizations, however their management was completely Chinese. Deng began de-collectivization and allowed Township and Village Enterprises (TVE), Special Economic Zones (SEZ), foreign investment, profit incentive, and even privatization. While Mao advocated self-reliance, Deng generated foreign exchange to finance modernization. His famous quote is, ""It doesn’t matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice."" Post Deng Reforms continued on this path which is acknowledged as a shift from the iron rice bowl to the porcelain rice bowl, or government owned to privatized. Although China’s economy has shifted towards privatization and capitalism, the PRC remains an authoritative regime, which is contradictory in comparison to other examples of countries that have modernized. Democracy is the political characteristic that has defined modernized nations in the past and the modernization theory suggests democracy follows with the development of a modernized state. China was late in modernization and has thus had many other countries as examples to base its model of modernization off of. The One-Child Policy has also been a technique to contribute or even force the modernization of China. Instigated in 1978, the one-child policy has created a generation known as ""singletons"" or ""little emperors"" (""xiao huangdi""). ""The Chinese state enforced a rapid fertility transition designed to cultivate a generation of ""high-quality"" people with resources and ambition to join the global elite."" These little emperors are expected to compete with the first-world countries having no siblings to compete with for parental investment. Normally with modernization and urbanization smaller or nuclear families evolve as the result. China has switched this logic, hoping that creating the culture of the nuclear family with the one-child policy it will produce modernization. At the beginning of the 21st century, China is still in the process of modernization. In 2010 it had the third greatest GDP and GDP (PPP) in the world with the world’s largest labor force, and is acknowledged as the world’s second largest economy. In 2010 its economy was still increasing in growth at 10.3%. China has also successfully joined the largely Western international arena with its membership of the UN in 1971, the WTO in 2001, and hosted the Olympics in 2008. China’s goal is to continue modernizing until it joins the first-world and becomes the core instead of the semi-periphery or periphery, from the core-periphery model. The modernization of China through urbanization, industrialization, and economic policy has benefited the country economically as it rises as a world power in the 21st century. However it now is experiencing the problems associated the other modern countries and capitalism. These problems include the growing disparity between the rich and poor, urban vs. rural and migration, and ecological issues. South Korea. Modernizers in South Korea in the late 19th century were torn between the American and the Japanese models. Most of the Koreans involved were educated Christians who saw America as their ideal model of civilization. However, most used Japan as a practical model - as an example of how a fellow East Asian country, which 30 years before was also backward, could succeed in civilizing itself. At the same time, reformists' nationalist reaction against the domineering, colonial behavior of the Japanese in Korea often took the form of an appeal to international (Western) standards of civilization. The Western-oriented worldview of the early Christian nationalist reformers was complex, multilayered, and often self-contradictory - with 'oppressive' features not easily distinguishable from 'liberational' ones. Their idealized image of the West as the only true, ideal civilization relegated much of Korea's traditional culture to a position of 'barbarism'. The self-image of Koreans was formed through complex relationships with modernity, colonialism, Christianity, and nationalism. This formation was initiated by a change in the notion of 'civilization' due to the transformation of 'international society' and thereafter was affected by the trauma of Japanese colonization. Through the process of transition from a traditional Confucian notion of civilization to a Western notion of acceptance and resistance, Koreans shaped their civilization as well as their notions of the racial, cultural, and individual modern self. Western Orientalism, in particular, accompanied the introduction of the Western notion of civilization, which served as the background for forming the self-identity of Koreans. The fact that the Japanese version of Orientalism emerged from the domination of Korea by Japan played a critical role in shaping the self-identity of Koreans. Consequently, Korea still maintains an inferiority complex toward Western culture, ambivalent feelings toward Japanese culture, and biased - positive or negative - views of their own cultural traditions. Thus both modernization and colonization have shaped the formation or distortion of self-consciousness of non-Western peoples. The US launched a decades-long intensive development starting in 1945 to modernize South Korea, with the goal of helping it become a model nation-state and an economic success. Agents of modernization at work in Korea included the US Army, the Economic Cooperation Administration, the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency, and a number of nongovernmental organizations, among them the Presbyterian Church, the YMCA, Boy Scouts and the Ford Foundation. Many Koreans migrated to California and Hawaii, and brought back firsthand accounts of modern business and governmental practices that they sought to adapt to Korean conditions. Japan. Japan quickly went through a lot of changes concerning modernization after their defeat. This happened starting with United States quickly intervening with Japan internally. Surprisingly, American demilitarization and democratization was somewhat accepted by the people of Japan without strong resistance. Under the occupation of United States, SCAP(Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) was established, which was an institution in charge of formulating policies. The goal of SCAP was to dissolve the army and navy, and also to punish responsible leaders, and it established the New constitution of 1946. SCAP could not function without the assistance of Japanese government because the language barrirer was too high. However, this actually helped make bigger changes in creating demilitarization and democratization. SCAP helped people to gain freedoms of speech, press and the right to organize labor or farmer unions. As such, the new constitution created by SCAP granted civil and political rights to the people; consequently, leading to modernization. It also allowed freedom of speech and association, right to organize labor association and movements, or create unions, and implemented grounds for incredible civil right for women. Nevertheless, the government also held an important role in modernizing Japan. Japan concentrated on their industry and technology to achieve growth. For that, the state gave assistances to several industries and adopted protectionism policies. Government stepped in as lender, as facilitator of access to foreign exchange, raw materials, or technology licenses, and as rescuer when problems arise. To illustrate, the most important guiding agency was the MITI(Ministry of International Trade and Industry). In addition, through the 1960s, Japanese government used economic policies such as tariffs to obstruct imports and protect Japanese firms from foreign competitors in domestic market to become a modernized country. Eurasia. Turkey. Turkey, under Kemal Atatürk in the 1920s and 1930s, engaged in a systematic modernization program called ""Kemalism"". Hundreds of European scholars came to help. Together with Turkish intellectuals they developed a successful model of development. Greece. The modernizing force of the post-civil war Greek society came primarily as a result of the European and US geopolitical strategy for the region of eastern Mediterranean. Greece ought to be a modern capitalistic state to counter the proximity of several eastern and third world bloc countries and the strong national communist movement. According to Truman doctrine and with the support of local elites, a great economical leap forward took place along with the severe repression that led to the 1967 coup d'état. This dramatic change covered the long standing cultural divide of greek academia, comparing modern and neo-greek to ancient and traditional identities. Music, art and cinema, influenced by the pioneers of American and European tendencies thrived, until the milestone of 1967, in contrast to the authoritarian and traditionalist military and paramilitary structures. This dimension is vital as it reveals the process of modernization under the western directives in all social levels that came in fact in opposition to the political directives of the same source. Latin America. Since independence, modernization has been a driving force for Chile's political elites. Ree (2007) analyzes projects of modernization that have been implemented from above since 1964. Despite their ideological differences and very different understandings of what modernity is, these projects shared key characteristics in their construction and implementation, such as the use of developmental theories, their state-orientation, the prominent role of technocrats and state-planning, and the capacity of adaptation in sight of civil unrest. These projects have produced patterns of modernity that have proven to be particularly stable. Africa. Modernization has been attributed with creating positive development around the world, but in Modern times its ability to promote development, specifically in Africa, has been less than so. Modernization that has taken place in Africa can be described as something that has yet to benefit most of the African countries. Modernization through development has led to problems in Nigeria by bringing in private, foreign owned oil companies that have been exploiting the natural resource wealth of the country. Because the oil companies are generally owned by a different nation, the profits are mostly being exported from Nigeria with only one fifteenth of the wealth produced in the region returning to it. Shell, the oil company operating in Ogoniland, Nigeria has helped the country develop and industrialize on a small scale, but it has primarily challenged the sovereignty and autonomy of Nigeria. A lot of scholars view modernization as a sort of westernization where western institutions such as national parks and industries are brought into existing cultures where their use does not make as much sense. Along with modernization comes a loss of culture and society, and the individual is strengthened. An African tribe known as the Ik was forced to change their habits due to modernization and the creation of individual countries caused by colonialism. Nationalization, as a tool of modernization, was imparted on Africa by colonialists who wanted to westernize and modernize tribal Africa. The creation of individual countries made life for the tribal Ik more difficult because they were forced out of their nomadic lifestyle into a settlement based around a newly founded national park that practically destroyed their livelihood by restricting their hunting grounds to specific non-park areas. The creation of national parks have had the effect of increasing cultivation which can be seen as good development because the people are no longer solely dependent on livestock. This creation of a new sort of livelihood has mixed improvements, because the tribal setting is not removed, rather it is put into a single place. Democracy. Scholars have long argued that democracy follows modernization, perhaps with a time lag. As Seymour Martin Lipset put it, ""All the various aspects of economic development--industrialization, urbanization, wealth, and education--are so closely interrelated as to form one major factor which has the political correlate of democracy."" In the 1960s some critics said the link each was too much based on European history, neglecting the Third World. Recent demonstrations of the emergence of democracy in South Korea, Taiwan and South Africa have tended to bolster the thesis. The historical problem case has always been Germany, in which economic modernization in the 19th century came long before the move to democracy after 1918. Berman, however, concludes that a process of democratization was underway in Imperial Germany, for ""during these years Germans developed many of the habits and mores that are now thought by political scientists to augur healthy political development."". Inglehart, and Welzel (2009) contend that the realization of democracy is not based solely on an expressed desire for that form of government, but that democracies are born as a result of the admixture of certain social and cultural factors. They argue the ideal social and cultural conditions for the foundation of a democracy are born of significant modernization and economic development that result in mass political participation. Peerenboom (2008) explores the relationships among democracy, the rule of law and their relationship to wealth by pointing to examples of Asian countries, such as Taiwan and South Korea, that have successfully democratized only after economic growth reached relatively high levels and to examples of countries such as the Philippines, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia and India that sought to democratize at lower levels of wealth but have not done as well. Adam Przeworski and others have challenged Lipset argument. They say political regimes do not transition to democracy as per capita incomes rise. Rather, democratic transitions occur randomly, but once there, countries with higher levels of gross domestic product per capita remain democratic. Epstein et al. (2006) retest the modernization hypothesis using new data, new techniques, and a three-way, rather than dichotomous, classification of regimes. Contrary to Przeworski, this study finds that the modernization hypothesis stands up well. Partial democracies emerge as among the most important and least understood regime types. Highly contentious is the idea that modernization implies more human rights, with China in the 21st century being a major test case. Development. Development, like modernization, has become the orienting principle of our time. Countries that are seen as modern are also seen as developed, and that means that they are generally more respected by institutions such as the United Nations and even as possible trade partners for other countries. The extent to which a country has modernized or developed dictates its power and importance on the international level. Modernization of the health sector of developing nations recognizes that transitioning from 'traditional' to 'modern' is not merely the advancement in technology and the introduction of Western practices; implementing modern healthcare requires the reorganization of political agendas, and in turn, an increase in funding and resources towards public health. However, rather than replicating the stages of developed nations, whose roots of modernization are found with the context of industrialisation or colonialism, underdeveloped nations should apply proximal interventions to target rural communities and focus on prevention strategies rather than curative solutions. This has been successfully exhibited by the Christian Medical Commission and in China through 'barefoot doctors'. Additionally, a strong advocate of the de-emphasis of medical institutions was Halfdan T. Mahler, the WHO General Director from 1973 to 1988. Related ideas have been proposed at international conferences such as Alma-Ata and the “Health and Population in Development” conference, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation in Italy in 1979, where selective primary healthcare and GOBI were discussed (although they have both been strongly criticized by supporters of comprehensive healthcare). Overall, however, this is not to say that the nations of the Global South can function independently from Western states; significant funding is received from well-intentioned programs, foundations, and charities which target epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis that have substantially improved the lives of millions of people but also impeded future development. Criticism. Modernization theory has been criticized, mainly because it conflated modernization with Westernization. In this model, the modernization of a society required the destruction of the indigenous culture and its replacement by a more Westernized one. By one definition ""modern"" simply refers to the present, and any society still in existence is therefore modern. Proponents of modernization typically view only Western society as being truly modern arguing that others are primitive or unevolved by comparison. This view sees unmodernized societies as inferior even if they have the same standard of living as western societies. Opponents of this view argue that modernity is independent of culture and can be adapted to any society. Japan is cited as an example by both sides. Some see it as proof that a thoroughly modern way of life can exist in a non-western society. Others argue that Japan has become distinctly more western as a result of its modernization. In addition, this view is accused of being Eurocentric, as modernization began in Europe with the industrial revolution, the French Revolution and the Revolutions of 1848, and has long been regarded as reaching its most advanced stage in Europe (by Europeans), and in Europe overseas (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc.). Anthropologists typically make their criticism one step further generalized and say that this view is ethnocentric, not being specific to Europe, but Western culture in general. There is a strong criticism of Modernization in Africa due to a major problem with governmental corruption that has ultimately slowed the development of African countries through wars and illegitimate financial activities that keep money out of the hands of the people. Modernization in theory should lead to wealthier more economically productive countries; however, the corruption that runs rampant through Africa’s nations has not allowed for much of this prosperity and growth to take place. The destruction of the tribal identities of Africans into national identities has also helped lead to problems with development bubbles. These development bubbles occur when cities rise into the position of industrialization, but the areas outside of the city do not develop and therefore a big inequality of wealth distribution becomes apparent. Therefore many of the people who once worked the agricultural areas in Africa, move to cities where they are expecting to find jobs that will sustain them. "
wikipedia-7003940," Wake Up Little Susie  ""Wake Up Little Susie"" is a popular song written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and published in 1957. The song is best known in a recording by The Everly Brothers, issued by Cadence Records as catalog number 1337. The Everly Brothers record reached number one on the ""Billboard"" Pop chart and the Cash Box Best Selling Records chart, despite having been banned from Boston radio stations for lyrics that, at the time, were considered suggestive. ""Wake Up Little Susie"" also spent seven weeks atop the ""Billboard"" country chart and got to number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song was ranked at #311 on the ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In an appearance on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" during the 2000 U.S. presidential election, then-Governor George W. Bush named ""Wake Up Little Susie"" as his favorite song. ""Wake Up Little Susie"" was the first single filmmaker David Lynch bought. Song premise. The song is written from the point of view of a high school boy to his girlfriend, Susie. In the song, the two go out on a date to a drive-in theater, only to fall asleep during the movie. They do not wake up until 4 o'clock in the morning, well after the 10 o'clock curfew. They then contemplate the reactions of her parents and their friends. Although banned in such places as Boston, the song does not state that Susie and her boyfriend had sexual relations. Indeed, it strongly implies that they did not; the couple simply fell asleep because they were bored by the movie. One line in the lyrics states that the movie """"wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot. We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputations shot."""" "
wikipedia-89320," Rug making  Rug making is an ancient craft, and covers a variety of techniques.  Braided. Braided rugs are made by using three or more strips of fabric, usually wool, folding the raw edges to the middle and braiding them together. For an oval rug the center braid should be one inch longer than the width-length in feet. example 2' x 4' rug center strip would be 2'2"" long. The center braid is laced together and new strips are sewn on to make the braid longer as lacing continues. Hooking. Traditional rug hooking is a craft in which rugs are made by pulling loops of yarn or fabric through a stiff woven base such as burlap, linen, rug warp or monks cloth. The loops are pulled through the backing material by using a latch hook mounted in a handle (usually wood) for leverage. Rag Rugs. Rag rugs were commonly made in households up to the middle of the 20th century by using odd scraps of fabric on a background of old sacking. Needlepunch. Using either yarn or strips of cloth, you work with the punch tool from the back side of the pattern. The Monk’s cloth backing is tightly stretched on to a frame. Every time you punch the needle down through the backing, it makes a long thread on the right side of the rug. Then, as you lift the needle, it automatically makes it into a loop. These loops pack together to create a rug so solid that chewing dogs and clawing cats are its only enemy. As long as you use the tool correctly, it will automatically make all the loops the same length. Sometimes referred to as ""speed hooking"", this method of rug hooking is liked for its ease and speed. Prodded. Proddy rugs are made, as the name implies, by prodding or poking strips of fabric through burlap or linen from the back side. Rag rugs made this way have many names; clippies, proddies, stobbies, pricked, in Northumberland they are called proggy mats, and in Scotland they are called clootie mats. They were often made for more utilitarian use such as by the backdoor; their pile hiding dirt well. Woven. Handmade and machine-made. See carpet. Woven rugs include both flat rugs (for example kilims) and pile rugs. The more tightly a rug is woven or knotted, the more detailed a design can be. ""It is generally believed that the density of knots determines the value of a carpet.[...] "

wikipedia-166557," Land speed record  The land speed record (or absolute land speed record) is the highest speed achieved by a wheeled vehicle on land. There is no single body for validation and regulation; in practice the Category C (""Special Vehicles"") flying start regulations are used, officiated by regional or national organizations under the auspices of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. The record is standardized as the speed over a course of fixed length, averaged over two runs (commonly called ""passes""). Two runs are required in opposite directions within one hour, and a new record mark must exceed the previous one by one percent to be validated. There are numerous other class records for cars; motorcycles fall into a separate class. History. The first regulators were the ""Automobile Club de France"", who proclaimed themselves arbiters of the record in about 1902. Different clubs had different standards and did not always recognise the same world records until 1924, when the ""Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus"" (AIACR) introduced new regulations: two passes in opposite directions (to negate the effects of wind) averaged with a maximum of 30 minutes (later more) between runs, average gradient of the racing surface not more than 1 percent, timing gear accurate within 0.01sec, and cars must be wheel-driven. National or regional auto clubs (such as AAA and SCTA) had to be AIACR members to ensure records would be recognized. The AIACR became the FIA in 1947. Controversy arose in 1963: ""Spirit of America"" failed on being a three-wheeler (leading the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme to certify the record when the FIA refused) and not wheel-driven so the FIA introduced a special wheel-driven class. No holder of the absolute record since has been wheel-driven. Women's land speed record. In 1906 Dorothy Levitt broke the women's world speed record for the flying kilometer, recording a speed of 91 mph (146.25 km/h) and receiving the sobriquet the ""Fastest Girl on Earth"". She drove a six-cylinder Napier motorcar, a 100 hp (74.6 kW) development of the K5, in a speed trial in Blackpool. The current record is held by Lee Breedlove, the wife of Craig Breedlove, who piloted her husband's ""Spirit of America - Sonic 1"" to a record of in 1965, making her the fastest woman alive, . According to author Rachel Kushner, Craig Breedlove had talked Lee into taking the car out for a record attempt in order to monopolize the salt flats for the day and block one of his competitors from making a record attempt. Records. 1963–present (jet and rocket propulsion). Craig Breedlove's mark of , set in ""Spirit of America"" in September 1963, was initially considered unofficial. The vehicle breached the FIA regulations on two grounds: it had only three wheels, and it was not wheel-driven, since its jet engine did not supply power to its axles. Some time later, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme created a non-wheel-driven category, and ratified ""Spirit of America""'s time for this mark. On July 27, 1964, Donald Campbell's Bluebird CN7 posted a speed of on Lake Eyre, Australia. This became the official FIA LSR, although Campbell was disappointed not to have beaten Breedlove's time. In October, several four-wheel jet-cars surpassed the 1963 mark, but were eligible for neither FIA nor FIM ratification. The confusion of having three different LSRs lasted until December 11, 1964, when the FIA and FIM met in Paris and agreed to recognize as an absolute LSR the higher speed recorded by either body, by any vehicles running on wheels, whether wheel-driven or not. Thus, Art Arfons' ""Green Monster"" was belatedly recognized as the absolute LSR holder, ""Bluebird"" the holder of the wheel-driven land speed record, and ""Spirit of America"" the tricycle record holder. No wheel-driven car has since held the absolute record. "
wikipedia-19321330," Nightclub  A nightclub (also known as a discothèque, or simply a club or disco) is an entertainment venue which usually operates late into the night. A nightclub is generally distinguished from bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a dance floor and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded electronic dance music, disco, house, hip hop, R&B, rock, reggae, pop, and other forms of dance music. The music in nightclubs is either live bands or, more commonly, a mix of songs played by a DJ through a powerful PA system. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres. History. Early history. From about 1900 to 1920, working class Americans would gather at honky tonks or juke joints to dance to music played on a piano or a jukebox. During US Prohibition, nightclubs went underground as illegal speakeasy bars. With the repeal of Prohibition in February 1933, nightclubs were revived, such as New York's 21 Club, Copacabana, El Morocco, and the Stork Club. These nightclubs featured big bands (there were no DJs). In Occupied France, jazz and bebop music, and the jitterbug dance were banned by the Nazis as ""decadent American influences"", so as an act of French resistance, people met at hidden basements called ""discothèques"" where they danced to jazz and swing music, which was played on a single turntable when a jukebox was not available. These ""discothèques"" were also patronized by anti-Vichy youth called zazous. There were also underground discotheques in Nazi Germany patronized by anti-Nazi youth called the swing kids. In Harlem, Connie's Inn and the Cotton Club were popular venues for white audiences. Before 1953 and even some years thereafter, most bars and nightclubs used a jukebox or mostly live bands. In Paris, at a club named Whisky à Gogo, founded in 1947, Régine in 1953 laid down a dance-floor, suspended coloured lights and replaced the jukebox with two turntables which she operated herself so there would be no breaks between the music. The Whisky à Gogo set into place the standard elements of the modern post World War II ""discothèque""-style nightclub. At the end of the 1950s, several of the coffee bars in Soho introduced afternoon dancing and the most famous, at least on the continent, was Les Enfants Terribles at 93 Dean St. These original discothèques were nothing like the night clubs, as they were unlicensed and catered to a very young public - mostly made up of French and Italians working illegally, mostly in catering, to learn English as well as au pair girls from most of western Europe. In the early 1960s, Mark Birley opened a members-only discothèque nightclub, Annabel's, in Berkeley Square, London. In 1962, the Peppermint Lounge in New York City became popular and is the place where go-go dancing originated. However, the first rock and roll generation preferred rough and tumble bars and taverns to nightclubs, and the nightclub did not attain mainstream popularity until the 1970s disco era. Sybil Burton, former wife of actor Richard Burton, opened the ""Arthur"" discotheque in 1965 on East 54th Street in Manhattan on the site of the old El Morocco nightclub and it became the first, foremost and hottest disco in New York City through 1969. 1970s: Disco. By the late 1970s many major US cities had thriving disco club scenes which were centered around discothèques, nightclubs, and private loft parties where DJs would play disco hits through powerful PA systems for the dancers. The DJs played ""... a smooth mix of long single records to keep people 'dancing all night long'"" Some of the most prestigious clubs had elaborate lighting systems that throbbed to the beat of the music. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as ""touch dancing"", the ""hustle"" and the ""cha-cha-cha"". There were also disco fashions that discothèque-goers wore for nights out at their local disco, such as sheer, flowing Halston dresses for women and shiny polyester Qiana shirts for men. Disco clubs and ""...hedonistic loft parties"" had a club culture which had many Italian-American, African American, gay and Hispanic people. In addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving drug subculture, particularly for recreational drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaine (nicknamed ""blow""), amyl nitrite ""poppers"", and the ""...other quintessential 1970s club drug Quaalude, which suspended motor coordination and turned one's arms and legs to Jell-O"". The ""massive quantities of drugs ingested in discothèques by newly liberated gay men produced the next cultural phenomenon of the disco era: rampant promiscuity and public sex. While the dance floor was the central arena of seduction, actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit stairwells, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of ""main course"" in a hedonist's menu for a night out."" Famous 1970s discothèques included ""...cocaine-filled celeb hangouts such as Manhattan's ""Studio 54"", which was operated by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager. Studio 54 was notorious for the hedonism that went on within; the balconies were known for sexual encounters, and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the ""Man in the Moon"" that included an animated cocaine spoon. Other famous 1970s discothèques in New York City included ""Xenon"", ""The Loft"", the ""Paradise Garage"", and ""Aux Puces"", one of the first gay disco bars. In San Francisco, there was the Trocadero Transfer, the I-Beam, and the End Up. By the early 1980s, the term ""disco"" had largely fallen out of favour in most of the English-speaking world. 1980s New York, London & Europe. During the 1980s, during the New Romantic movement, London had a vibrant nightclub scene, which included clubs like The Blitz, the Batcave, the Camden Palace and Club for Heroes. Both music and fashion embraced the aesthetics of the movement. Bands included Depeche Mode, The Human League, Duran Duran, Blondie, Eurythmics and Ultravox. Reggae-influenced bands included Boy George and Culture Club, and electronic vibe bands included Visage. At London nightclubs, young men would often wear make-up and young women would wear men's suits. The largest UK cities like Leeds (The Orbit), Newcastle, Liverpool (Quadrant Park and 051), Swansea, Manchester (The Haçienda) and several key European places like Paris (Les Bains Douches), Ibiza (Pacha), Rimini etc. also played a significant role in the evolution of clubbing, DJ culture and nightlife. Significant New York nightclubs of the period were Area, Danceteria, and The Limelight. 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. In Europe and North America, nightclubs play disco-influenced dance music such as house music, techno, and other dance music styles such as electronica and trance. Most nightclubs in the U.S. major cities that have an early adulthood clientele, play hip hop, dance-pop, house and/or trance music. These clubs are generally the largest and most frequented of all of the different types of clubs. The emergence of the ""superclub"" created a global phenomenon, with Ministry of Sound (London), Cream (Liverpool) and Pacha (Ibiza). Techno clubs are especially popular around the world since the early 1990s. Famous examples are Berghain, Bunker and Tresor in Berlin, ""Omen"" and ""Cocoon"" in Frankfurt, ""Distillery"" in Leipzig, ""Tunnel Club"" in Hamburg, Warehouse in Chicago and The Haçienda in Manchester. In most other languages, nightclubs are referred to as ""discos"" or ""discothèques"" ( or ; ; Italian, Portuguese and Spanish: ""discoteca,"" ""antro"" (common in Mexico only), and ""boliche"" (common in Argentina only), ""discos"" is commonly used in all others in Latinamerica). In Japanese ディスコ, ""disuko"" refers to an older, smaller, less fashionable venue; while クラブ, ""kurabu"" refers to a more recent, larger, more popular venue. The term ""night"" is used to refer to an evening focusing on a specific genre, such as ""retro music night"" or a ""singles night."" A recent trend in the North American, Australian and European nightclub industry is the usage of video. VJs (""video jockeys"") mix video content in a similar manner that DJs mix audio content, creating a visual experience that is intended to complement the music. The beginning of the 21st century saw financial growth of the nightclub industry in the United States. However, the number of nightclubs and employees has been decreasing. In 2010, there were nearly 45,000 bars and nightclubs across the country. Nightclub entry criteria. Many nightclubs choose who can enter, on bases other than just age, e.g. dress code and guest list. This is used to make their status as a nightclub more ""exclusive"". Quite often, there are no clear policies governing entry to a nightclub, thereby allowing the doormen to deny entry to anybody at their discretion. Association. Many nightclubs will only allow entry by association, such as the former Paradise Garage and Playboy Club. A number of gay nightclubs that prefer to cater to an exclusively male clientele will deny entry to a group of lesbians but will welcome a lesbian with a number of male gay friends. Cover charge. In most cases, entering a nightclub requires a flat fee called a cover charge. Some clubs waive or reduce the cover charge for early arrivers, special guests or women (in the United Kingdom this latter option is illegal under the Equality Act 2010 but the law is rarely enforced and open violations are frequent). Friends of the doorman or the club owner may gain free entrance. Sometimes, especially at larger clubs in Continental European countries, one only gets a pay card at the entrance, on which all money spent in the discothèque (often including the entrance fee) is marked. Sometimes, entrance fee and cloakroom costs are paid by cash and only the drinks in the club are paid using a pay card. Dress code. Many nightclubs enforce a dress code in order to ensure a certain type of clientele is in attendance at the venue. Some upscale nightclubs ban attendees from wearing trainers (sneakers) or jeans, while other nightclubs will advertise a vague ""dress to impress"" dress code that allows the bouncers to discriminate at will against those vying for entry to the club. Many exceptions are made to nightclub dress codes, with denied entry usually reserved for the most glaring rule breakers or those thought to be unsuitable for the party. Certain nightclubs like fetish nightclubs may apply a dress code (BDSM) to a leather-only, rubber-only or fantasy dress code. The dress code criterion is often an excuse for discriminatory practices, such as in the case of Carpenter v. Limelight Entertainment Ltd. Exclusive Boutique Nightclubs. Large cosmopolitan cities that are home to large affluent populations (such as Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and London) often have what are known as exclusive boutique nightclubs. This type of club typically has a capacity of less than 200 occupants and a very strict entrance policy, which usually requires an entrant to be on the club's guest list. While not explicitly members only clubs, such as Soho House, exclusive nightclubs operate with a similar level of exclusivity. As they are off limits to most of the public and ensure the privacy of guests, many celebrities favor these types of clubs to other, less exclusive, clubs which do not cater as well to their needs. Another differentiating feature of exclusive nightclubs is, in addition to being known for a certain type of music, they are known for having a certain type of crowd (for instance, a fashion-forward, affluent crowd or a crowd with a high concentration of fashion models. Many exclusive boutique clubs market themselves as being a place where one can socialize with models and celebrities. Affluent patrons who find this marketing message appealing are often willing to purchase bottle service at a markup of several times the retail cost of the liquor. London's most exclusive boutique nightclubs include Amika, Cirque Du Soir, Project, The Box, and The Rose Club. These venues are frequently visited by an array of A-List celebrities from the fashion, film, and music industries. All are located in London's prestigious Mayfair, except Cirque Du Soir and The Box, which are both located in London's sex capital, Soho, and the both have a more risque theme. Guest list. Many nightclubs operate a ""guest list"" that allows certain attendees to enter the club for free, or at a reduced rate. Some nightclubs have a range of unpublished guest list options ranging from free, to reduced, to full price with line by-pass privileges only. Nightclub goers who are on the guest list often have a separate queue and sometimes a separate entrance from those used by full price-paying attendees. It is common for the guest list line-up to be as long or longer than the full-paying or ticketed queues. Some nightclubs allow clubbers to register for the guest list through their websites. Security. Most nightclubs have a team of security men (also known as ""bobbies"" or bouncers). They have the power to remove people from the club. Most major clubs have balconies specifically for this team to watch over the clubbers. The team would only intervene or ask for removal if the clubber is extremely drunk, physically ill, breaking club rules, or hurting/abusing other clubbers. The majority of the team stand by doors and make sure that no-one enters in that way. Other jobs for the team involve locking up and asking people to leave once the club closes. "
wikipedia-1817978," Capital Cost Allowance  Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) is the means by which Canadian businesses may claim depreciation expense for calculating taxable income under the ""Income Tax Act"" (Canada). Similar allowances are in effect for calculating taxable income for provincial purposes. General rules for CCA calculation. Capital property. Capital property eligible for CCA excludes: CCA is calculated on ""undepreciated capital cost"" (""UCC""), which is generally defined as: Where the UCC for a class is negative, a ""recapture of depreciation"" is deemed to take place, thus adding to taxable income and bringing the balance of UCC back to zero. Where UCC for a class is positive, but all assets with respect to that class have been disposed of, a ""terminal loss"" is deemed to take place, thus deducting from taxable income and bringing the balance of UCC back to zero. CCA calculation. CCA itself is generally calculated using the following items: For assets subject to the full-year rule: formula_1 For assets subject to the half-year rule: formula_2 Types of allowance. Under the ""Income Tax Act"": Part XI of the ""Income Tax Regulations"" provides for the calculation rules for CCA, and Schedule II outlines the various classes of capital property that are eligible for it. Special rules are in place to deem certain assets to be in separate classes, thus not becoming part of the general pool for the class. Certain elections are available to taxpayers to transfer or reclassify assets from one class to another. Additional allowances are prescribed with respect to specified circumstances. Specialized calculations for certain classes are also outlined in: Part XVII of the ""Income Tax Regulations"" provides for specialized calculation rules for CCA with respect to capital property acquired for use in earning income from farming and fishing. Typical classes of assets for CCA purposes. In contrast to the practice followed in the United States for depreciation there is no penalty for failing to claim Capital Cost Allowance. Where a taxpayer claims less than the amount of CCA to which he is entitled the pool remains intact, and available for claims in future years. Unclaimed amounts are not subject to recapture. Capital investment appraisal under CCA rules. Because assets subject to CCA are generally pooled by class, and CCA is generally calculated on a declining-balance basis, specific techniques have been developed to determine the net present after-tax value of such capital investments. For standard scenarios under the full-year rule and half-year rule models, the following standard items are employed: More specialized analysis would need to be applied to: Full-year rule. Capital cost allowance will be calculated as follows: Therefore, the tax shield in year ""n"" = formula_3, and the present value of the taxation credits will be equal to formula_4 As this is an example of a converging series for a geometric progression, this can be simplified further to become: formula_5 The net present after-tax value of a capital investment then becomes: formula_6 Half-year rule. For capital investments where CCA is calculated under the half-year rule, the CCA tax shield calculation is modified as follows: formula_7 Therefore, the net present after-tax value of a capital investment is determined to be: formula_8 Case Law. In cases where claims have been contested or disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency, the Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted the Capital Cost Allowance in a fairly broad manner, allowing deductions on property which was owned for a very brief period of time, and property which is leased back to the vendor from which it originated. These decisions demonstrate the flexibility of the Capital Cost Allowance as a legal tax reduction strategy.  "
wikipedia-10585511," Time slip  A time slip is an alleged paranormal phenomenon in which a person, or group of people, travel through time via unknown means. As with all paranormal phenomena, the objective reality of such experiences is disputed. Cases. Ghosts of Versailles. One of the best-known, and earliest, examples of a time slip was reported by two English women, Charlotte Anne Moberly (16 September 1846 - 7 May 1937) and Eleanor Jourdain (1863–1924), the principal and vice-principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford, who claimed they slipped back in time in the gardens of the Petit Trianon at Versailles from the summer of 1901 to the period of the French Revolution. The Vanishing Hotel. A widely-publicised case from October 1979, described in the ITV television series ""Strange But True?"", concerned the Simpsons and the Gisbys, two English married couples driving through France en route to a holiday in Spain. They claimed to have stayed overnight at a curiously old-fashioned hotel and decided to break their return journey at the same hotel but were unable to find it. Photographs taken during their stay were missing, even from the negative strips when the pictures were developed. Other cases. More recent reports include a series of accounts of apparent time slips in the area of Bold Street, Liverpool from the 1990s to the present day. Andrew MacKenzie, of the Society for Psychical Research, investigated several British cases, including an experience in which three naval cadets appeared to travel back in time to Kersey in Suffolk at a time when it was a medieval plague village, and one in which a Scottish woman experienced the aftermath of the Dark Age Battle of Nechtanesmere in 685 AD. Sir Victor Goddard claimed to have seen, in 1935, the Drem, Scotland airfield as it would be in 1939. Characteristics. Feeling of unreality. Many time slip witnesses report that, at the start of their experience of the phenomena, their immediate surroundings take on an oddly flat, underlit and lifeless appearance, and normal sounds seem muffled. This is sometimes accompanied by feelings of depression and unease. In some respects, this facet of the phenomenon is similar to the Oz Factor identified by British UFO researcher Jenny Randles in some reports of encounters with supposed extraterrestrial craft. Moberly's account of her experience at Versailles records: We walked briskly forward, talking as before, but from the moment we left the lane an extraordinary depression had come over me, which, in spite of every effort to shake off, steadily deepened. There seemed to be absolutely no reason for it; I was not at all tired, and was becoming more interested in my surroundings. I was anxious that my companion should not discover the sudden gloom upon my spirits, which became quite overpowering on reaching the point where the path ended, being crossed by another, right and left…Everything suddenly looked unnatural, therefore unpleasant; even the trees behind the building seemed to have become flat and lifeless, like a wood worked in tapestry. There were no effects of light and shade, and no wind stirred the trees. It was all intensely still. Jourdain's report of the same event states that: there was a feeling of depression and loneliness about the place. I began to feel as if I were walking in my sleep; the heavy dreaminess was oppressive. Ability to interact. Reports vary as to whether those experiencing time slips can take an active part in the event, interacting with the time being ""visited"". In the Versailles case, the two ladies were apparently seen, and spoken to, by people they saw. The British holidaymakers in 1979 went further, staying in a hotel and eating dinner and breakfast in the course of their experience. Both these cases are also unusually prolonged experiences, taking place over at least several hours. In other cases, the subject is a passive observer of the ""past"" scene, and it seems that the ""typical"" time slip lasts only a matter of a few minutes. In popular culture. The idea of a time slip has been exploited by a number of science fiction and fantasy writers. This is one of the main plot devices on time travel stories, the other being a time machine. The difference is that in time slip stories, the protagonist typically has no control and no understanding of the process (which is often never explained at all) and is either left marooned in a past time and must make the best of it, or is eventually returned by a process as unpredictable and uncontrolled. Conversely, in a time machine story the protagonist is typically in control of the process, understands the scientific principles involved and can come and go between times at discretion. The two types of time travel were popularized at the end of the 19th century by respectively Mark Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" and H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"", both having considerable influence on later writers. Notable later stories using the theme include John Wyndham's short stories ""Odd"" and ""Stitch in Time"" in ""Consider Her Ways"" (1961). ""Chronoclasm"" and ""Pawley's Peepholes"", included in the collection ""The Seeds of Time"" (1956), explore the subject from the point of view of those being visited. The 1990 novella ""The Langoliers"" by Stephen King involved a jet airliner which had passed through a timeslip into yesterday, and the crew and passengers' desperate attempts to return to today before being consumed by the eponymous Langoliers. Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist of the Kurt Vonnegut novel ""Slaughterhouse-Five"", experiences a series of time slips throughout his life after becoming ""unstuck in time"". ""Martian Time-Slip"" is a 1964 science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick. It advances the idea that the flow of time can change or even be reversed from place-to-place. Time on Mars is much more malleable than time on Earth or at least there are more portals and loop holes on Mars. In ""11/22/63"", a 2011 novel by Stephen King, Jake Epping walks through a time slip to enter into 1958 to prevent the Kennedy assassination. In the 2011 Woody Allen film ""Midnight in Paris"", the main character, Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), is mysteriously sent back to 1920s Paris via Peugeot Type 176 to interact with the so-called Lost Generation era of authors and artists. Additionally, the character of Adriana (Marion Cotillard) experiences an even further slip of time into the Belle Époque era, where she elects to stay. External links.

wikipedia-1960270," Nasrid dynasty  The Nasrid dynasty ( ""banū Naṣr"") was the last Arab Muslim dynasty in Spain. The Nasrid dynasty rose to power after the defeat of the Almohad Caliphate in 1212 at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Twenty-three different emirs ruled Granada from the founding of the dynasty in 1232 by Mohammed I ibn Nasr until January 2, 1492, when Muhammad XII surrendered to the Christian Spanish kingdoms of Aragon and Castile. Today, the most visible evidence of the Nasrids is the Alhambra palace complex built under their rule. Nasab. Arabs trace their ancestry through their ""nasab"", i.e. patrilineal descent. The Nasrid dynasty claimed direct male-line descent from Sa'd ibn Ubadah, chief of the Banu Khazraj tribe and one of the companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Banu Khazraj were themselves part of the Qahtanite group of tribes, which originate in the southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula. The ""nasab"" of Yusuf (nicknamed ""al-Ahmar"", meaning ""the Red""), the common ancestor of all Nasrid sultans, is shown below. The name of Nasr, from whom the dynasty derives its name, appears in bold font. Conflicts of Succession and Civil War. During the time the Christians were launching a campaign against the Emirate of Granada that would effectively end the Nasrid dynasty, the Nasrids were engaged in a civil war over the throne of Granada. When Abu l-Hasan Ali the reigning amir was ousted by his son Abu 'abd Allah Mumhamed XII. Abu l-Hasan Ali retreated to Malaga and civil war broke out between the competing factions. Christians took full advantage of this and continued capturing Muslims strongholds. Muhammed XII was caught by Christian forces in 1483 at Lucena. He was freed after he swore an oath of allegiance to Ferdinand and Isabella. Abu l-Hasan Ali finally abdicated in favor of his brother Sa'd al-Zaghal (the valiant) and a power struggle with Abu 'abd Allah (Mumhamed XII) continued. Sa'd prevailed in the inner struggle but was forced to surrender to the Christians. Abu 'abd Allah (Mumhamed XII) was given a lordship in the Alpujarras mountains but instead took financial compensation from the Spanish crown to leave the Iberian Peninsula. Family tree. The family tree below shows the genealogical relationship between each sultan of the Nasrid dynasty. It starts with their common ancestor, Yusuf al-Ahmar. Daughters are omitted, as are sons whose descendants never reigned. During times of rival claims to the throne, the family tree generally recognizes the sultan who controlled the city of Granada itself and the Alhambra palace. "
wikipedia-3136654," Glorious Appearing  Glorious Appearing: The End of Days is the 12th book in the Left Behind series. Released on Tuesday, March 30, 2004, this book sees the surviving believers awaiting the return of Jesus Christ as the war of Armageddon and the seven-year Tribulation period draws to its climax. It was on ""The New York Times"" Best Seller list for 22 weeks. It takes place from the day of to the day after the Glorious Appearing. Plot summary. The Antichrist has assembled the armies of the world in the Valley of Megiddo for what he believes will be his ultimate triumph of the ages. With a victory here, he would ascend to the throne of God. The Tribulation Force has migrated to the Middle East, most ensconced at Petra with the Jewish Remnant, now more than a million strong. Petra is surrounded by the Unity Army, poised to destroy all that is left of God's people and usher in Nicolae Carpathia's new world order. The world holds its breath as the greatest military battle to ever take place threatens to obliterate all that remains of humanity. All seems lost. Tsion Ben-Judah and Buck Williams have been slain in Jerusalem, now overrun by Global Community forces. The hour of attack for Nicolae Carpathia’s Global Community Unity Army to assault the Rebels at the Temple Mount draws near. The seventh and final Bowl Judgement comes in the form of the greatest earthquake ever measured, followed by a rain of hailstones. Rayford Steele is the only original member of the Tribulation Force alive, and he's severely injured and on the brink of death. The sign of the Son of Man, a large Cross of lightning, appears over the global skyline for the whole world to witness. In addition, people who were sick and disabled were healed, and those who were formerly undecided were on their knees crying out for God to save them. This does not dissuade the enemies of God, as the Unity Army, led by Antichrist himself, makes their final charge against Petra, seeking to annihilate all remaining rebels to the Global Community. But suddenly, when all seems lost, the entire planet is covered in shadowless light and Jesus Christ returns to Earth in power and glory followed by the armies of heaven, slaying the armies of the Global Community with the Word of God in the four final battles of the Apocalypse, leading to a final confrontation with Antichrist in Jerusalem. Once the Global Unity Army has been destroyed, Jesus Christ sets foot on the Mount of Olives and sets up his kingdom in Jerusalem, where he proceeds to sentence the Beast (Nicolae Carpathia) and his False Prophet (Leon Fortunato) to eternity in the lake of fire for the atrocities they committed against the entire world. Thereafter, Christ condemns Lucifer to 1,000 years in the abyss. In the newly formed Valley of Jehosaphat, Jesus condemns the last of the unbelievers and those who received the Mark of the Beast, cleansing the world for the beginning of his thousand-year reign. Those who were Raptured or martyred return to Earth to be reunited with their loved ones, and Paradise is ushered in. Believers from all over the world finally reunite in Jerusalem after the long seven years of the Tribulation and welcome the dawn of the Millennium World. Characters. The Recently Martyred Reception. In the ""National Review"", the Catholic author Carl E. Olson described ""Glorious Appearing"" as ""400 pages of repetitive, numbing bombast"", and said that the premillenialist dispensationalist theology that forms the theological basis for the novels ""is rejected, either explicitly or implicitly, by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox churches, and nearly every major Protestant denomination"". Olson also argues that the plot and details of the Left Behind series are similar to and possibly plagiarised from the Rapture novel ""666"" by Salem Kirban. "
wikipedia-598741," Cardiothoracic surgery  Cardiothoracic surgery is the field of medicine involved in surgical treatment of diseases affecting organs inside the thorax (the chest)—generally treatment of conditions of the heart (heart disease) and lungs (lung disease). Cardiac surgery (involving the heart and great vessels) and thoracic surgery (involving the lungs) are separate surgical specialties, except in the USA, Australia, New Zealand and in some EU countries, such as the UK and Portugal. Training. A cardiac surgery residency typically comprises anywhere from six to nine years (or longer) of training to become a fully qualified surgeon. Cardiac surgery training may be combined with thoracic surgery and / or vascular surgery and called cardiovascular (CV) / cardiothoracic (CT) / cardiovascular thoracic (CVT) surgery. Cardiac surgeons may enter a cardiac surgery residency directly from medical school, or first complete a general surgery residency followed by a fellowship. Cardiac surgeons may further sub-specialize cardiac surgery by doing a fellowship in a variety of topics including: pediatric cardiac surgery, cardiac transplantation, adult acquired heart disease, weak heart issues and many more problems in the heart. Australia and New Zealand. The integrated advanced training program in Cardiothoracic Surgery is six years in duration with two of these years being devoted to experience in General Surgery, preferably during the first three years. Trainees having completed a training program in General Surgery and have obtained their FRACS will have the option to complete fellowship training in Cardiothoracic Surgery of four year in duration. Canada. Historically, cardiac surgeons in Canada completed general surgery followed by a fellowship in CV / CT / CVT. During the 1990s, the Canadian cardiac surgery training programs changed to six-year ""direct-entry"" programs following medical school. The direct-entry format provides residents with experience related to cardiac surgery they would not receive in a general surgery program (e.g. echocardiography, coronary care unit, cardiac pathology, etc.). Contemporary Canadian candidates completing general surgery and wishing to pursue cardiac surgery often complete a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship in the United States. However, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada affords a three-year cardiac surgery fellowship for qualified general surgeons that is offered at several training sites including the University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto. United States. Cardiac surgery training in the United States is combined with thoracic surgery and called cardiothoracic surgery. Cardiothoracic surgeons in the U.S. is a physician (D.O. or M.D.) who first completes a general surgery residency (typically 5–7 years), followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship (typically 2–3 years). The cardiothoracic surgery fellowship typically spans two or three years, but certification is based on the number of surgeries performed as the operating surgeon, not the time spent in the program, in addition to passing rigorous board certification tests. Recently, however, options for an integrated 6-year cardiothoracic residency (in place of the general surgery residency plus cardiothoracic residency) have been established at several programs. Applicants match into these I-6 programs directly out of medical school, and the application process has been extremely competitive for these positions as there were approximately 160 applicants for 10 spots in the U.S. in 2010. As of May 2013, there are now 20 approved programs, which include the following: The American Board of Thoracic Surgery offers a special pathway certificate in congenital heart surgery which typically requires an additional year of fellowship. This formal certificate is unique because pediatric cardiac surgeons in other countries do not have formal evaluation and recognition of pediatric training by a licensing body. Cardiac surgery. The earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero Dominique Jean Larrey, Henry Dalton, and Daniel Hale Williams. The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on the 4th of September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. He ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24 year old man who had been stabbed in the left axillae and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day. The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896. Surgery in great vessels (aortic coarctation repair, Blalock-Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus), became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery, but technically cannot be considered heart surgery. One of the more commonly known cardiac surgery procedures is the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), also known as ""bypass surgery."" In this procedure, vessels from elsewhere in the patient's body are most commonly harvested using a procedure known as EVH, and grafted to the coronary arteries to bypass blockages and improve the blood supply to the heart muscle. Early approaches to heart malformations. In 1925 operations on the heart valves were unknown. Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several years but Souttar’s physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue. Cardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1948 four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever. Horace Smithy (1914–1948) of Charlotte, revived an operation due to Dr Dwight Harken of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital using a punch to remove a portion of the mitral valve. Charles Bailey (1910–1993) at the Hahnemann Hospital, Philadelphia, Dwight Harken in Boston and Russell Brock at Guy’s Hospital all adopted Souttar’s method. All these men started work independently of each other, within a few months. This time Souttar’s technique was widely adopted although there were modifications. In 1947 Thomas Holmes Sellors (1902–1987) of the Middlesex Hospital operated on a Fallot’s Tetralogy patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellor’s work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. Later in 1948 he designed a punch to resect the infundibular muscle stenosis which is often associated with Fallot’s Tetralogy. Many thousands of these “blind” operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible. Open heart surgery. Open heart surgery is a surgery in which the patient's heart is opened and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. It was soon discovered by Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment, which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood. The first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by Dr. C. Walton Lillehei and Dr. F. John Lewis at the University of Minnesota on September 2, 1952. The following year, Soviet surgeon Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vishnevskiy conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia. This surgery is during which the heart is exposed and the blood made to bypass it. Surgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia – complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body, particularly to the brain. The patient needs the function of the heart and lungs provided by an artificial method, hence the term cardiopulmonary bypass. Dr. John Heysham Gibbon at Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method, disappointed by subsequent failures. In 1954 Dr. Lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique in which the patient's mother or father was used as a 'heart-lung machine'. Dr. John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota started using a Gibbon type pump-oxygenator in a series of successful operations, and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world. Nazih Zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on February 25, 1960, at Mercy Hospital, Oklahoma City, OK. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later in 1963. In March, 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer, performed open heart surgery on a child, age 3½, using the total intentional hemodilution machine. In 1985 Dr. Zuhdi performed Oklahoma's first successful heart transplant on Nancy Rogers at Baptist Hospital. The transplant was successful, but Rogers, a cancer sufferer, died from an infection 54 days after surgery. Modern beating-heart surgery. Since the 1990s, surgeons have begun to perform ""off-pump bypass surgery"" – coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned cardiopulmonary bypass. In these operations, the heart is beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage; in the U.S., most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH). Some researchers believe that the off-pump approach results in fewer post-operative complications, such as postperfusion syndrome, and better overall results. Study results are controversial as of 2007, the surgeon's preference and hospital results still play a major role. Minimally invasive surgery. A new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is robot-assisted heart surgery. This is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient. Instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside, it does not have to be bigger than 3 small holes for the robot's much smaller ""hands"" to get through. Pediatric cardiovascular surgery. Pediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children.The first operations to repair heart defects in children were performed by Clarence Crafoord in Sweden when he repaired coarctation of the aorta in a 12 year old boy. The first attempts to palliate congenital heart disease were performed by Alfred Blalock with the assistance of William Longmire, Denton Cooley, and Blalock's experienced technician, Vivien Thomas in 1944 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Techniques for repair of congenital heart defects without the use of a bypass machine were developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Among them was an open repair of an atrial septal defect using hypothermia, inflow occlusion and direct vision in a 5-year old child performed in 1952 by Lewis and Tauffe. C. Walter Lillihei used cross-circulation between a boy and his father to maintain perfusion while performing a direct repair of a ventricular septal defect in a 4 year old child in 1954. He continued to use cross-circulation and performed the first corrections of tetratology of Fallot and presented those results in 1955 at the American Surgical Association. In the long-run, pediatric cardiovascular surgery would rely on the cardiopulmonary bypass machine developed by Gibbon and Lillehei as noted above. The first successful pediatric cardiac operation in Utah was performed by Russell M. Nelson at the Salt Lake General Hospital in March 1956, a total repair of tetralogy of Fallot in a four-year-old girl. Risks of cardiac surgery. The development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4–6% mortality rates. A major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of neurological damage. Stroke occurs in 5% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and is higher in patients at risk for stroke. A more subtle constellation of neurocognitive deficits attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is known as postperfusion syndrome, sometimes called ""pumphead"". The symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent, but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment. In order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the EuroSCORE. This takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge. Within the UK this EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for cardiothoracic surgery and to give some indication of whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range. The results are available on the CQC website. The precise methodology used has however not been published to date nor has the raw data on which the results are based. "
wikipedia-18236215," Bruce Dickinson discography  Bruce Dickinson, a British heavy metal singer, has released six studio albums, two live albums, one compilations, one EP, ten singles, three video albums, fourteen music videos, and one box set. In 1979, after playing in local groups, Dickinson joined hard rock band Samson. He departed after two years to become Iron Maiden's lead vocalist. His debut with this band is considered a ""masterpiece"", which was followed with a series of top-ten releases. In 1989, while Iron Maiden were taking a year off, Dickinson and former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, composed a song for . His solo debut, ""Tattooed Millionaire"" (1990), was an effort that favoured a hard rock/pop metal approach, different from what fans assumed would be an aggressive, Iron Maiden-like album. Four songs—the title track, ""Dive! Dive! Dive!"", ""Born in '58"", and a cover version of David Bowie's ""All the Young Dudes""—were released as singles. Dickinson returned to Iron Maiden, accompanied by Gers as the new guitarist, and the project went on hiatus. ""Dive! Dive! Live!"" was a live video recorded from a concert in Los Angeles, California, in August 1990, and released in July 1991. After a farewell tour in 1993, Dickinson left Iron Maiden and started working on a second album with Tribe of Gypsies guitarist and band leader, Roy Z. In June 1994, he released ""Balls to Picasso"", which reached the top 30 in several countries. Allmusic deemed the album ""somewhat of a disappointment"" which failed to ""come up with anything truly groundbreaking"", except for ""Tears of the Dragon"", which was released as a single, along with ""Shoot All the Clowns"". Roy Z departed to continue with his work and Dickinson recruited new members, with whom he released the double-disc live performance, ""Alive in Studio A"". The third album, ""Skunkworks"", was released in 1996, marking a ""highly approved stylistic shift"". The single ""Back from the Edge"" was released to promote this effort. A live video and an EP were recorded from a concert in Spain, and released in Japan, as ""Skunkworks Live"". Due to musical differences, the Skunkworks line-up split up, and Dickinson once again was joined by Roy Z, along with then ex-Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith. The follow-up album, ""Accident of Birth"" (1997), marked a return to a heavier sound for Dickinson. The title track and ""Man of Sorrows"" were released as singles. The next year he released a semi-concept album on alchemy, ""The Chemical Wedding"", which was described as a ""modern metal aesthetic"". The ""muscular anthem"", ""Killing Floor"", was the album's single. The live album, ""Scream for Me Brazil"", documented a 1999 live performance in São Paulo during the supporting tour. That year, Dickinson and Smith rejoined Iron Maiden, and the project once again went on hiatus. He released a ""best of…"" album in 2001, which included two new songs, ""Broken"" and ""Silver Wings"". On 23 May 2005, Dickinson released his first album in seven years, ""Tyranny of Souls"". To commemorate this, all of his past releases were remastered, with his studio efforts containing bonus tracks, and the live recordings merged into a single box set, entitled ""Alive"". The 2006 DVD, ""Anthology"", contained three live performances, all of the promo videos, and over an hour of extras. "
wikipedia-4149005," Morris Light Reconnaissance Car  Morris Light Reconnaissance Car was a British light armoured car for reconnaissance use produced by Morris Motors Limited and used by the British during the Second World War. The Nuffield Group had been brought in to supplement production of light reconnaissance cars by Standard Motor Company (Beaverette) and Humber (Humber LAC, also known as ""Humberette""). The vehicle had an unusual internal arrangement, with three-man crew sitting side by side by side with the driver in the middle, a crewman manning a small multi-sided turret mounting Bren light machine gun at the right side, and another with Boys .55 inch anti-tank rifle (mounted in brackets in the hatches on the hull roof) and access to radio set at the left. From 1940 to 1944 over 2,200 were built. The vehicle was used in North African, Italian and in North-West Europe campaigns. Some served with the RAF Regiment. Some were given to Polish units. One of the surviving vehicles is on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, another at the Bovington Tank Museum. "
wikipedia-15297037," Omar bin Laden  Omar bin Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (, ""ʿUmar bin ʾUsāmah bin Muḥammad bin ʿAwaḍ bin Lādin""; born 1981), better known as Omar bin Laden, is one of the sons of Osama bin Laden and his first wife and first cousin Najwa Ghanem (see Bin Laden family). He is the 4th eldest son among twenty children of Osama bin Laden. Older reports have described him and his brother Abdullah bin Laden as nephews or cousins of Osama bin Laden. Childhood. Bin Laden was born the grandson of Muhammed bin Awad bin Laden, the founder of one of the wealthiest non-royal families in Saudi Arabia, and the son of Osama bin Laden, whose partisan activities shaped his childhood. Bin Laden accompanied his father on his exile to Sudan from 1991 to 1996, and then to Afghanistan after that. He said that he trained in al-Qaeda camps beginning at the age of 14, but after training with al-Qaeda for 6 years and sharing a house with al-Qaeda's second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahiri, he left al-Qaeda in 2000 because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians and his father Osama did not object. In 2010, Omar bin Laden told ABC News that Osama had severely beaten him when he was a child for smiling too widely. Adult life. Bin Laden was in Saudi Arabia when the September 11 attacks occurred. A special chartered flight to Saudi Arabia, embarking eight days after the September 11th attacks, carried 13 bin Laden relatives including Omar Awad bin Laden, described as a nephew of Osama bin Laden living with Omar's cousin Abdullah bin Laden, founder of WAMY, out of the United States  Bin Laden runs his own company in Jeddah as a contractor and scrap metal dealer. Jeddah, a major city and important transit port for Saudi Arabia, is the site of the headquarters of the Saudi Binladen Group and has been reported to be ""truly"" ruled by Bakr bin Laden. Marriage to Zaina Mohamed Al-Sabah. He married Jane Felix-Browne, who also goes by the name Zaina Mohamed Al-Sabah, a parish councillor from Moulton, near Northwich in Cheshire in the United Kingdom, in September 15th 2006. The marriage was conducted in September 2006 in Islamic ceremonies in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia, after which the couple spent a few months together in Jeddah before Zaina returned to Britain for several weeks. Zaina has been married five times previously, beginning with a Saudi man at the age of 16, who introduced her to several members of the bin Laden family. She believes she met Osama bin Laden at a party in London in the 1970s. It has been reported that Felix-Browne met bin Laden while she was undergoing treatment for multiple sclerosis. They met on a horseback ride at the Giza pyramids in Egypt. She is his second wife and is 24 years older than he is, with five grandchildren. She was aware when she married Omar that he was already been married, with a two-year-old son. After their wedding, Al-Sabah described the stress of bin Laden's family background: ""Omar is wary of everyone. He is constantly watching people who he feels might be following him. Not without reason he is fearful of cameras. He is the son of Osama. But when we are together he forgets his life."" The couple announced their divorce in September 2007, which was said to be in response to threats to their ""lives and liberty"" from two unspecified sources known to them in Saudi Arabia. At the time, Al-Sabah said she didn't regard herself as divorced and that the divorce under duress did not have legal standing under Sharia law. After 2 weeks, Zaina and Omar decided not to part. In January 2008, bin Laden applied for a British spousal immigration visa which would have permitted him to reside indefinitely at his wife's home in Moulton, Cheshire, a process which required him to provide original documentation of his divorce from his first wife. The couple stated their desire to have a child using a surrogate mother. One report stated the visa application was denied because Omar failed to provide his father's permanent address. However, a later report by The Times of Omar's appeal stated that the visa had been denied by an entry clearance officer at the British embassy in Cairo because Omar's entry would cause ""considerable public concern."" The officer was quoted, ""I note that statements made during recent media interviews indicate evidence of continuing loyalty to your father, and your presence in the UK could, therefore, cause considerable public concern."" This written statement was shown to The Associated Press by the couple's legal firm, but Britain's Home Office declined to comment to the press on an individual case. In April 2008, bin Laden and Al-Sabah said they planned to appeal the ruling, calling it ""unjust and arbitrary"", stating that Al-Sabah requires medical attention in Britain and that her appeal to live with him in Saudi Arabia could take years to process. As of April 2008, bin Laden has a house in Cairo. In April 2010, bin Laden was denied a visa to promote his book ""Osama bin laden: A Family Portrait"" in France and elsewhere in Europe. Specifically, the countries of the Schengen zone, a block of 25 nations across Europe including Germany, France and Spain, had decided to reject his request for a visa. In July 2010, Jane Felix-Browne told the media that bin Laden is bipolar and that he was in a Qatari mental institution after hearing voices. Felix-Browne told the media that when bin Laden returned to the UK, Felix-Browne told him she wanted a divorce. North African horse race. Widespread news coverage beginning with an Associated Press interview in Cairo, Egypt on January 11, 2008 has featured bin Laden with cornrows and a black leather biker jacket promoting a horse race for peace across North Africa. The race is in the planning stages, awaiting approval from governments along the route and sponsors to provide money to benefit child victims of war. The plan calls for the race to proceed each day, with week-long rests in each country. It is scheduled to begin in March. PETA president Ingrid E. Newkirk has called for the cancellation of the race in an ""urgent letter"" from the organization, predicting that the gruelling race would lead to fatalities among the horses. PETA has reported that the bin Ladens have emailed correspondence stating that the horse race will not be conducted in summer or in the midday sun and that veterinary care will be provided. Omar describes the race as an equine counterpart to the cancelled 2008 Paris-Dakar car rally, saying, ""I heard the rally was stopped because of al-Qaida. I don't think they are going to stop me."" The race was canceled after the killings of four French tourists near Aleg, Mauritania on Christmas Eve 2007. Following the murders race organizers received threats directly from heavily armed and organized groups linked to al-Qaeda, which led them to cancel the race on January 4, 2008 and soon after to plan the 2009 event for South America. Police in Guinea-Bissau said that two of five men arrested for the crime on January 11, 2008 admitted al-Qaeda involvement. Relationship to his father and al-Qaeda. Bin Laden has said he is critical of his father Osama bin Laden and has said that his father feels that he is just trying to defend the Islamic world, and that his father is not a terrorist ""because history tells you he's not"". In an interview with ABC News he said, ""My father is very kind man. And he very sorry when he do something like 11th September."" Osama ordered the attacks ""Because he believes if he put two buildings down, maybe some people, little will die, but millions other will (be) save(d). He believed that. ... I believe he did it the wrong"". In a January 21, 2008 CNN interview, he said ""I try and say to my father: 'Try to find another way to help or find your goal. This bomb, this weapons, it's not good to use it for anybody"". Regarding the September 11 attacks he said, ""I don't think 9/11 was right personally, but it happened. I don't think ... war in Vietnam was right. I don't think what's going on in Palestine is right. I don't think what's going on in Iraq is right. If we make what is right and not right, we will make a very big list."" Bin Laden stated that he had not been in contact with his father since leaving Afghanistan in 2000. He has said, ""The last time I saw my father was in 2000, 2001. I was in Saudi Arabia and felt a terrible sorrow for all the victims the September 11 attacks"", ""My father has a kind heart"", and ""I do not believe my father is dead, otherwise I would have known it; the world would have known it."" When asked whether he would tell the Americans if he found out where his father was living, he said with a smile, ""Actually, I would hide him. Because he is my father."" According to ""Time"" magazine's website, bin Laden has stated a desire to become an ""ambassador of peace"" between Muslims and the West. Omar has said that Osama bin Laden offered a truce to Europe in a 2004 videotape and a conditional truce with the United States in a 2006 videotape, and believes a truce is possible. ""My father is asking for a truce but I don't think there is any government (that) respects him. At the same time they do not respect him, why everywhere in the world, they want to fight him? There is a contradiction."" The truces offered in these videos of Osama bin Laden were promptly rejected at the time. After arriving in Rome from Switzerland amid heavy security on February 2, bin Laden said in a television interview that night ""I would very much like to meet the Pope in St Peter's, but I have been told that it is not easy."" Asylum petitions. On November 3, 2008, Spain's Interior Ministry, upon recommendation by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, denied, for ""insufficient evidence of danger or threat to life"", Omar's political asylum petition, after he was refused a UK visa. Omar, 27, had 24 hours to appeal, after he made his claim at Madrid's Barajas International Airport upon a stopover on a flight from Cairo, Egypt to Casablanca, Morocco. Bin Laden and his wife arrived in Doha, Qatar (where, as a Saudi citizen with Saudi passport, he would have right of entry), on November 9, 2008, after deportation by Egypt per its denial of their entry.  Omar filed another British visa petition. Book. Bin Laden and his mother Najwa bin Laden published a book authored with Jean Sasson in late October 2009, titled ""Growing Up bin Laden"". According to media coverage, the book details that ""the kids grew up in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Afghanistan without laughter or toys, were routinely beaten, and lost their pets to painful death from poison gas experiments by their father's fighters."" It states that Osama bin Laden tried to persuade his son to volunteer for suicide missions and exposed him to dangerous conditions visiting training camps in Afghanistan and sending him to the front lines of the Afghan civil war. The book describes the family living in Jeddah without air conditioning or refrigeration, treating asthma with honeycombs and onions, and eventually moving to stone huts in Tora Bora without electricity or running water in 1996. Subsequent correspondence with the Associated Press indicated that 25 bin Laden family members had moved to Iran, following U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. Death of his father. Bin Laden published a complaint on May 10, 2011, that the burial at sea of his father Osama deprived the family of a proper burial. "

Cuca Beer was born in 1947, under the name CUCA-Companhia União de Cervejas de Angola, SARL, with a capital of 5,000 contos, being a daughter company of the Portuguese Central de Cervejas. On May 26, 1976, the Government of Angola confiscated and nationalized Cuca, after taking possession of the Commission for Restructuring the brewing industry. It is manufactured in Luanda and in Catumbela, in the municipality of Lobito, Benguela province. The Benguela production amounts to 60 000 bars per day. In Angola, the main competitor of Cuca is EKA, another Angolan beer. In Namibia. In Namibia, Cuca beer was illegal in the 1970s and 1980s, yet it was widely available in the northern parts of the country, in Ovamboland and Kavango. Bars there became known as “Cuca shops”. Around the time of Namibian independence, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance was said to have offered free beer in Cuca shops, in an attempt to lure voters to its side. "
wikipedia-8916541," Machel Montano  Machel Montano (born 24 November 1974, Trinidad and Tobago) is a soca singer, record producer and songwriter based in Trinidad and Tobago. He is the frontman of the popular soca band The HD Family, and is noted for his high energy, fast-paced, and often unpredictable on-stage performances. During his career, which spans over 30 years, he has recorded several songs alongside many of Caribbean music's most popular acts, such as Lerone Guy of St Anthonys College, Alison Hinds, Beenie Man, Calypso Rose, Burning Flames, Drupatee, Wyclef Jean, Canibus, Red Rat, Shaggy, Sparrow, Denise Belfon, Ken Marlon Charles (KMC), Destra, Walker Hornung, Vybz Kartel, Mohombi, G-Unit, Black Stalin, David Rudder, Buju Banton, Mr. Vegas, Doug E. Fresh, Pitbull, Busta Rhymes and many others. In 1987 he was the youngest finalist to ever win the Caribbean Song Festival. He now stands as one of the most well-known soca acts in the world, using his leverage as an artist able to sell-out shows. Recently he has moved to the Los Angeles area and furthered his pursuit saying ""I may not be the one to bring it forth, but in the meantime, I have a lot of work to do in order for something to happen"". He is very well known in New York and has had sold out concerts in Madison Square Gardens many times over. Early career. Born in Carenage (West Trinidad), his family moved to Siparia, South Trinidad, when he was very young. Machel attended Siparia Boys' R.C., then Presentation College, a prestigious secondary school in San Fernando, where he was in the choir led by Mrs. Cynthia Lee-Mack. Machel first shot to fame as a 9-year-old boy with the song ""Too Young To Soca"" while he was still in primary school. In 1984, along with his older brother Marcus and neighbours, the group Panasonic Express was started and, in 1989, the band became Xtatik. Machel is father to three children: son Nicholas (14) and daughters Meledi(14) and Malaya Journey (11). Machel Montano HD - his concepts. The band developed and was re-invented by its leader Montano several times, including as Clamydia, The Xtatik Circus, Xtatik The Road Marching Band and The Band of the Year, as part of Machel's Zen battle to keep his band and his performances fresh. Since 2007 they became known as Machel Montano HD (High Definition); Machel promotes the concept by saying that he is the first human being to go HD. He claims this is a representation of the evolution of his music over the last 25 years and highly improved style in which his music shall be presented to his fans over radio formats, television, and during live performances. He is part of a campaign in Trinidad and Tobago to promoting safe driving - ""Arrive Alive"". Part of the hype surrounding Montano since 2007 is his HD tour bus, a 20-year-old bus from the Public Transport Service Corporation (PTSC) that was re-done and includes a bedroom, bathroom facilities, flat-screen TVs, Internet access and expensive audio systems. After its debut in 2007, the bus was re-painted for 2008, the new images of Machel matching various photos from the album artwork of his 2008 CD, ""Flame On"". The bus featured heavily in his videos for ""Jumbie"" (2007) and ""Rollin/Blazin d Trail"" (2008). In 2012 Machel Montano won the Road March, Power Soca Monarch and the Groovy Soca Monarch. He won the Groovy Soca Monarch with his rendition ""Mr. Fete"". In May 2012 the singer launched the music video to his hit single ""Bottle Of Rum"".. Xtatik's music. In the last few years the band has risen to a new level of musicality as each performance is very tight musically and has foreign influences such as Ernesto Luis Gutirrez, its Venezuelan percussionist, Shawn Mitchell, bassist from Grenada and musicians from Barbados. Kernal Roberts, the son of the late Lord Kitchener (calypsonian) has picked up the role as Xtatik's drummer and musical director and has brought new life to the band. Montano was also instrumental in the promotion of soca music in the United Kingdom on the BBC's black music digital radio station BBC Radio 1Xtra, where he co-presented the International Sounds of Soca show for four years with DJ Slic. He has released many successful singles, with and without Xtatik, during his career, such as ""Big Truck"" (Xtatik's most successful single, which won the Road March title in 1997), ""Outa Space"" (with Beenie Man), ""Music Farm"" (Xtatik), ""It's Carnival"" (with Destra), and his most recent back to back Road March title wins for 2006, ""Band Of The Year"" (with Patrice Roberts) and 2007, ""Jumbie"". His 2008 album ""Flame On"", was released in February 2008 and featured collaborations with some of the most esteemed artistes in calypso such as David Rudder on ""Oil and Music"" and The Mighty Sparrow on ""Congo Man"". These two collaborations were well-received all around, especially ""Congo Man"". ""Flame On"" also includes Clamydia with other well-known artistes from various genres including soca, reggae, rap and reggaeton. Examples of these partnerships can be heard on the following tracks: Patrice Roberts on ""Rollin"", Shaggy on ""Wining Season"", Buju Banton on ""Make Love"" and finally Lil Jon and Pitbull on ""Defense (The Anthem)"". ""Flame On"" displays the very strong relationship between Machel Montano and Kernal Roberts, his right-hand man. Roberts was involved in the writing of eight out the 13 tracks on the album. In Trinidad's Carnival Road March Competition for Carnival 2008, Montano's song ""Blazin d Trail"" placed third even though it was a crowd favourite when it was played at Carnival fetes during the Carnival season of 2008. In 2011, Machel won the International Soca Monarch competition defeating the likes of Iwer George (2nd) and Bunji Garlin (3rd) after a fierce night of competition. In the end, Machel walked away with the TT$2 million dollar prize and the first International Soca Monarch title of his career. He then went on to win the Carnival Road March title with the same hit 'Advantage' by a landslide victory. In 2012, Machel once again won the International Power Soca Monarch with the song ""Pump Yuh Flag"". Montano once again received the TT$2 million dollar prize and title. Also he entered the Groovy Soca Monarch and was victorious ousting the reigning Groovy Soca Monarch King Kes Diffenthaller and crowd favorite Kerwin Du Bois who placed 2nd in the competition. Topping off the Carnival Season in Trinidad & Tobago, he won the Carnival Road March title (Pump Yuh Flag-Played 233 Times). His closest challengers were Fay Ann Lyons(96) & Iwer George(84). 2011 and 2012 to date have been the most successful of Montano's career and most attribute it to his strong work ethic, relationship with current manager, James Walton and mother Liz Montano. Criminal Charges. On December 10, 2012, SOCA STAR Machel Montano was found guilty of five criminal offences. Montano, the reigning Power Soca Monarch and Road March king, along with Kernal Roberts, the son of legendary Calypso icon Lord Kitchener (calypsonian), Joel ""Zan"" Feveck, a member of Montano HD Family, and Rodney ""Benjai"" LeBlanc, best known for his patriotic song, Trini, were all charged with a series of criminal offences arising out a fracas outside the Zen nightclub, in Port of Spain in April 2007. After postponing her decision on two consecutive occasions, Magistrate Maureen Baboolal-Gafoor, presiding in the Port of Spain Magistrates Court, delivered her decision to a packed courtroom. Montano was found guilty on four charges of assault against Gerard Borwin, Brandis Browne, Janelle Lee Chee and Russell Pollonais. Montano was also found guilty of using obscene language during the same incident. Roberts, the composer of several of Montano's hits, was also found guilty on two charges of assault while Benjai, who was charged with two offences of assault and Feveck, who was charged with a single offence of assault, were found not guilty. During the trial, which lasted more than five years, Montano had given ten days of evidence. During his testimony, Montano had denied the charges brought against him, stating instead that he was the one who was attacked by the group and spat at. Sentencing. In passing sentence on February 25, 2013, Magistrate Gafoor-Baboolal said she had taken into account Montano's good character, and that he had made a valuable contribution to the country. However, the magistrate said that despite this, the two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm were very serious and the court had to send a message that such behaviour would not be tolerated. She said that given the seriousness of the offences, she did not believe that community service should be imposed. For the offence of common assault against Gerard Bowrin, Montano was fined $300 and ordered to pay $1,000 compensation. On the charge of common assault against Lee Chee, he was fined $300 and ordered to pay $1,500 in compensation. On the obscene language conviction, he was reprimanded and discharged. For beating Browne, Montano was fined $3,000 and ordered to pay $3,000 in compensation. For beating Pollonais, he was fined $10,000 and ordered to pay $8,000 in compensation to his victim.

wikipedia-940565," Monsoon Wedding  Monsoon Wedding is a 2001 film directed by Mira Nair and written by Sabrina Dhawan, which depicts romantic entanglements during a traditional Punjabi Hindu wedding in Delhi. Writer Sabrina Dhawan wrote the first draft of the screenplay in a week while she was at Columbia University's MFA film program. ""Monsoon Wedding"" earned just above $30 million at the box office. Although it is set entirely in New Delhi, the film was an international co-production between companies in India, the United States, Italy, France, and Germany. The film won the Golden Lion award and received a Golden Globe Award nomination. A musical based on the film is currently in development and is scheduled to premiere on Broadway in April 2014. This film is part of the Criterion Collection. Plot. The film's central story concerns a father, Lalit Verma (Naseeruddin Shah), who is trying to organise an enormous, chaotic, and expensive wedding for his daughter, Aditi (Vasundhara Das), for whom he has arranged a marriage with a man she has known for only a few weeks (Parvin Dabas as Hemant Rai). As so often happens in the Punjabi culture, such a wedding means that, for one of the few times each generation, the extended family comes together from all corners of the globe including India, Australia, Oman, and the United States, bringing its emotional baggage along. It is a story set in the modern upper-middle class of India, where telecommunications and a western lifestyle mix with old traditions, like the arranged wedding young Aditi accepts when she ends a current affair. The groom is an Indian living in Texas, and all relatives from both families, some from distant places like Australia, come to New Delhi during the monsoon season to attend the wedding. The four-day arrangements and celebrations will see clumsy organisation, family parties and drama, dangers to the happy end of the wedding, and lots of music. Soundtrack. The soundtrack includes a qawwali by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, a ghazal by Farida Khanum, a Punjabi song by Sukhwinder Singh, an old Indian song by Rafi, a folk dance song. The film includes an Urdu ghazal, Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo (Don't Be So Stubborn About Leaving Today)"" sung by Pakistani artist Farida Khanum. Awards. The movie won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Mira Nair was the second Indian (after Satyajit Ray for ""Aparajito"") to receive this honour. "

He founded the private equity firm Apollo Global Management in 1990. Early life and education. Black is a son of Eli M. Black (1921–1975), a prominent Jewish businessman who owned the United Brands Company who emigrated from Poland. His mother, Shirley Lubell, was an artist. In 1975, his father committed suicide by jumping from the 44th floor of the Pan Am Building in New York City. It was later made public that federal regulators were investigating allegations of bribery of Honduran government officials by United Brands. Black received a BA in Philosophy and History from Dartmouth College in 1973, and served on the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College from 2002 to 2011. He received an MBA from Harvard University in 1975. Career. From 1977 to 1990 Leon Black was employed by investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, where he served as managing director, head of the Mergers & Acquisitions Group, and co-head of the Corporate Finance Department. In 1990, he co-founded, on the heels of the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Notable founders included: John Hannan, Drexel's former co-director of international finance; Craig Cogut, a lawyer who worked with Drexel's high-yield division in Los Angeles; and Arthur Bilger, the former head of the Drexel's corporate finance department; Antony Ressler, who worked as a senior vice president in Drexel's high yield department with responsibility for the new issue/syndicate desk; and Marc Rowan, Josh Harris and Michael Gross, who all worked under Black in the mergers and acquisitions department.

wikipedia-2900533," Argyraspides  The Argyraspides (in ""Silver Shields""), were a division of the Macedonian army of Alexander the Great, who were so called because they carried silver-plated shields. They were picked men, were commanded by Nicanor, the son of Parmenion, and were held in high honour by Alexander. They were hypaspists, having changed their name to the Argyraspides whilst in India under Alexander (Arr. Anab. 7.11.3). After the death of Alexander (323 BC) they followed Eumenes. They were veterans, and although most of them were over sixty, they were feared and revered due to their battle skills and experience. At the Battle of Gabiene they settled with Antigonus when he managed to take possession of their baggage train (consisting of their families and the result of forty years of plunder). They obtained the return of their possessions, but in exchange delivered their General Eumenes to him (316 BC).  Antigonus, however, soon broke up the corps, finding it too turbulent to manage. He sent them to Sibyrtius, the Macedonian satrap of Arachosia, with the order to dispatch them by small groups of two or three to dangerous missions, so that their numbers would rapidly dwindle. The Seleucid kings of Syria employed an infantry phallangite corps of the same name. At the Battle of Raphia in 217 BC the Argyraspides took up positions against the Ptolemaic phalanx. Polybius describes them as being armed in the Macedonian manner (Polyb. 5.79.4, 82.2). Their position besides the king at the Battle of Magnesia suggests that they were the premier infantry guard unit in the Seleucid army. They were men chosen from the whole kingdom (Polyb. 5.79.4) and constituted a corps of 10,000 men at Raphia. At the Daphne parade held by Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 166 BC the Argyraspides were 5,000 strong. However the corps of men described by Polybius as being armed and dressed in the 'Roman fashion' numbered 5,000, and Bar-Kochva suggests that these men, who are described as being in the prime of life, might have also been a division of the Argyraspides, putting the number of the corps back up to 10,000 strong. The Roman Emperor Alexander Severus, among other things in which he imitated Alexander the Great, had in his army bodies of men who were called ""argyroaspides"" and ""chrysaspides"". Livy mentions a cavalry corps called silvershields as the royal cohort in the army of Antiochus III the Great in Magnesia. "
wikipedia-5256544," Dolorimeter  A dolorimeter is an instrument used to measure pain threshold and pain tolerance. Dolorimetry has been defined as ""the measurement of pain sensitivity or pain intensity."" There are several kinds of dolorimeter that have been developed. Dolorimeters apply steady pressure, heat, or electrical stimulation to some area, or move a joint or other body part and determine what level of heat or pressure or electric current or amount of movement produces a sensation of pain. Sometimes the pressure is applied using a blunt object, or by locally increasing the air pressure on some area of the body, and sometimes by pressing a sharp instrument against the body. History. In 1940, James D. Hardy, Harold G. Wolff and Helen Goodell of Cornell University introduced the first dolorimeter as a method for evaluating the effectiveness of analgesic medications. They did their work at New York Hospital. They focused the light of a 100 watt projection lamp with a lens on an area of skin that had been blackened. They found that most people expressed a pain sensation when the skin temperature reached 113 °F (45 °C). They also found that after the skin temperature reached 152 °F (67 °C), the pain sensations did not intensify even if the heat was increased. They developed a pain scale, called the ""Hardy-Wolff-Goodell"" scale, with 10 gradations, or 10 levels. They assigned the name of ""dols"" to these levels. Unfortunately, other researchers were not able to reproduce the results of Hardy, Wolff and Goodell and the device and the approach was abandoned. Harvard Medical School Professor and Massachusetts General Hospital Anaesthetist Henry K. Beecher (1957) expressed skepticism about this method of measuring pain. In 1945, ""Time"" magazine reported that Cleveland's Dr. Lorand Julius Bela Gluzek had developed a dolorimeter that measured pain in grams. Dr. Gluzek claimed that his dolorimeter was 97% accurate. Palpometer. A dolorimeter known as the ""Sonic Palpometer"" was developed at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. Patents have been applied for worldwide. The Sonic Palpometer uses ultrasound and computer technology to automate the physician's technique of palpation to determine sensitivity of some part of the patient's body. The related pressure controlled palpometer (PCP) uses a pressure-sensitive piece of plastic film to determine how much pressure is being applied in palpation. This technique appears to be more reliable than unaided palpation. Algorimeter and other methods. Techniques using lasers. Svensson et al. (1997) describe the use of a CO2 laser or a contact thermode to heat the skin and elicit a pain response. A laser-based dolorimeter called a ""Dolorimeter Analgesia meter"" is marketed by IITC Life Sciences. Techniques using heat lamps. Another pain measurement device uses heat from a 500 watt lamp which is delivered to a small area of skin. Other dolorimeters. Other terms for similar instruments include ""algesiometer"", ""algesichronometer"" (which also takes time into consideration), ""analgesia meter"", ""algometer"", ""algonometer"", ""prick-algesimeter"", ""pressure-algometer"". Dolorimetry for animals. Dolorimetry in animals involves application of pain to various body parts. It is occasionally used as a diagnostic tool, and routinely used in basic pain research and in the testing of analgetics. "

If placed at the center of the Solar System, UY Scuti can engulf all the planets all the way to Jupiter, filling more than halfway through Saturn's orbit. It contains the volume of approximately 5 billion times that of the Sun's. Physical characteristics. It is one of the extremely luminous supegiant stars. It is a semiregular variable star with the corresponding period of about 740 days. It varies sightly in magnitudes over time. The star was almost totally obscured by dust and gas in its outbursts, due to its small density, making it to hold no longer its own by its gravity, similar to the smaller red hypergiant star VY Canis Majoris. Due to this, its true size is still debated, and may have a diameter smaller than its current estimate. "
wikipedia-4209079," Pit of despair  The pit of despair was a name used by American comparative psychologist Harry Harlow for a device he designed, technically called a vertical chamber apparatus, that he used in experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1970s. The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression. Researcher Stephen Suomi described the device as ""little more than a stainless-steel trough with sides that sloped to a rounded bottom"": Harlow had already placed newly born monkeys in isolation chambers for up to one year. With the pit of despair, he placed monkeys between three months and three years old in the chamber alone, after they had bonded with their mothers, for up to ten weeks. Within a few days, they had stopped moving about and remained huddled in a corner. Background. Much of Harlow's scientific career was spent studying maternal bonding, what he described as the ""nature of love"". These experiments involved rearing newborn monkeys with surrogate mothers, ranging from toweling covered cones to a machine that modeled abusive mothers by assaulting the baby monkeys with cold air or spikes. The point of the experiments was to pinpoint the basis of the mother-child relationship, namely whether the infant primarily sought food or affection. Harlow concluded it was the latter. In 1971, Harlow's wife died of cancer and he began to suffer from depression. He was treated and returned to work but, as Lauren Slater writes, his colleagues noticed a difference in his demeanor. He abandoned his research into maternal attachment and developed an interest in isolation and depression. Harlow's first experiments involved isolating a monkey in a cage surrounded by steel walls with a small one-way mirror, so the experimenters could look in, but the monkey could not look out. The only connection the monkey had with the world was when the experimenters' hands changed his bedding or delivered fresh water and food. Baby monkeys were placed in these boxes soon after birth; four were left for 30 days, four for six months, and four for a year. After 30 days, the ""total isolates,"" as they were called, were found to be ""enormously disturbed."" After being isolated for a year, they barely moved, did not explore or play, and were incapable of having sexual relations. When placed with other monkeys for a daily play session, they were badly bullied. Two of them refused to eat and starved themselves to death. Harlow also wanted to test how isolation would affect parenting skills, but the isolates were unable to mate. Artificial insemination had not then been developed; instead, Harlow devised what he called a ""rape rack,"" to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture. He found that, just as they were incapable of having sexual relations, they were also unable to parent their offspring, either abusing or neglecting them. ""Not even in our most devious dreams could we have designed a surrogate as evil as these real monkey mothers were,"" he wrote. Having no social experience themselves, they were incapable of appropriate social interaction. One mother held her baby's face to the floor and chewed off his feet and fingers. Another crushed her baby's head. Most of them simply ignored their offspring. Most of the monkeys placed inside it were at least three months old and had already bonded with others. The point of the experiment was to break those bonds in order to create the symptoms of depression. The chamber was a small, metal, inverted pyramid, with slippery sides, slanting down to a point. The monkey was placed in the point. The opening was covered with mesh. The monkeys would spend the first day or two trying to climb up the slippery sides. After a few days, they gave up. Harlow wrote, ""most subjects typically assume a hunched position in a corner of the bottom of the apparatus. One might presume at this point that they find their situation to be hopeless."" Stephen J. Suomi, another of Harlow's doctoral students, placed some monkeys in the chamber in 1970 for his PhD. He wrote that he could find no monkey who had any defense against it. Even the happiest monkeys came out damaged. He concluded that even a happy, normal childhood was no defense against depression. The experiments delivered what science writer Deborah Blum has called ""common sense results,"" namely, that monkeys, normally very social animals in nature, emerge from isolation badly damaged, and that some recover while others do not. Reaction. The experiments were condemned, both at the time and later, from within the scientific community and elsewhere in academia. In 1974, American literary critic Wayne C. Booth wrote that, ""Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties."" He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work. Harlow's colleagues and doctoral students also expressed concern. Sackett told Blum that, in his view, the animal liberation movement in the U.S. was born as a result of Harlow's experiments.  Charles Snowdon, a junior member of the faculty at the time, who became head of psychology at Wisconsin, said that Harlow had himself been very depressed by his wife's cancer. Snowdon was appalled by the design of the vertical chambers. He asked Suomi why they were using them, and Harlow replied, ""Because that's how it feels when you're depressed."" Leonard Rosenblum, who studied under Harlow, told Lauren Slater that Harlow enjoyed using shocking terms for his apparatus because ""he always wanted to get a rise out of people.""  Another of Harlow's students, William Mason, who also conducted deprivation experiments elsewhere, said that Harlow ""kept this going to the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities, that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive. It's as if he sat down and said, 'I'm only going to be around another ten years. What I'd like to do, then, is leave a great big mess behind.' If that was his aim, he did a perfect job."" "
wikipedia-424237," Diminished triad  In music, a diminished triad () is a triad consisting of two minor thirds above the root — if built on C, a diminished triad would have a C, an E and a G. It resembles a minor triad with a lowered (flattened) fifth. It can be represented by the integer notation {0, 3, 6}. In the common practice period, the diminished triad is considered dissonant, or unstable. It lacks tonal center or drive because the diminished fifth symmetrically divides the octave. A diminished triad occurs in a major scale only on the seventh scale degree; in the key of C, this is a B diminished triad (B, D, F). Since the triad is built on the seventh scale degree, it is also called the leading-tone triad. The leading-tone triad also occurs in the seventh chord built on the fifth degree; in C, this is G dominant seventh (G, B, D, F). For this reason, it has dominant function. Unlike the dominant triad or dominant seventh, the leading-tone triad functions as a prolongational chord rather than a structural chord since the strong root motion by fifth is now absent. On the other hand, the diminished triad in a minor scale occurs on the second scale degree; in the key of C minor, this is the D diminished triad (D, F, A). This triad is consequently called the supertonic diminished triad. Like the supertonic triad found in a major key, the supertonic diminished triad has a predominant function, almost always resolving to a dominant functioning chord. In a twelve-tone equal tempered tuning, a diminished triad has 3 semitones between the third and fifth, 3 between the root and third, and 6 between the root and fifth. It is represented by the integer notation {0, 3, 6}. In just intonation, the diminished triad on vii is tuned 135:162:160. According to Sorge, the trumpet, in its overtone series on C, gives the diminished triad e-g-b = 5:6:7 (""perfect diminished chord""), but the 7 is too flat and 45:54:64 is preferred. Helmholtz describes the diminished triad as b1−d | f, giving a just minor third and Pythagorean minor third in the notation system used in ""On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music"". In some sheet music books , Cdim or C° denotes a diminished seventh chord (a four note chord) with root C, and Cm-5 or Cm5 denotes a diminished triad with root C. However, in some modern jazz books and some music theory literature , Cdim or C° denotes a diminished triad, while Cdim7 or C°7 denotes a diminished seventh chord. ""In and pop music, the diminished triad nearly always appears on the second scale degree, forming a generally maudlin and dejected ii with its members, 2—4—6."" Songs that feature ii include Santo & Johnny's Sleep Walk, Jay and the Americans' ""Cara Mia"", and The Hollies' ""The Air That I Breathe"". Not so rare but rare enough so as to imply knowledge of and conscious avoidance on the part of rock musicians, examples of its use include Oasis' ""Don't Look Back In Anger"", David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"", and two in Paul Young's ""Go Away"". The supertonic diminished triad and leading-tone diminished triad are usually found in first inversion (ii6 and vii6 respectively) since the spelling of the chord forms a diminished fifth with the bass. This differs from the fully diminished seventh chord, which commonly occurs in root position. In both cases resolve the bass up and move the upper voices downwards in contrary motion. The popular music symbol for a diminished triad is a capital letter designating the root (as with a major chord) with MI(5) added. For example BMI(5) (see also Chord names and symbols (jazz and pop music)). "

wikipedia-9143451," Entre Nous  Entre Nous (""""Between Us""""; also known as Coup de foudre) is a 1983 French biographical drama film directed by Diane Kurys, who shares the writing credits with Olivier Cohen. Set in the France of the mid twentieth century, the film stars Isabelle Huppert, Miou-Miou, Guy Marchand, Jean-Pierre Bacri and Christine Pascal. ""Coup de Foudre"" means ""love at first sight"". Plot. ""Entre Nous"" tells the story of two young married women in the 1950s who don't recognise how unfulfilled they have been in their marriages until they meet each other. In the preliminary scenes, set in 1942, Lena (Isabelle Huppert), a pretty 18 year old, has been arrested and brought to an internment camp for Jews in the Pyrenees. The camp is guarded by members of the French Foreign Legion, and one of them, Michel (Guy Marchand), writes her a note warning her she may be deported to a German Nazi camp, and offers her marriage as a means of escape. She accepts. During the marriage ceremony she discovers that he too is Jewish; she's dismayed to learn that she won't have the protection of a gentile name.  But she has no choice and they hasten to the Italian border. By 1952, the hardworking Michel has got himself his own garage in Lyon, and they have two small daughters. Lena meets Madeleine (Miou-Miou), at a school pageant. Madeleine, who comes from a moderately wealthy family, was an art student in 1942, and had married a fellow student who was killed in a street skirmish between the students and the collaborationist police. A widow at 19, Madeleine drifted into marriage with an actor/black marketeer, Costa (Jean-Pierre Bacri), and now has a son at the school. The two women become inseparable.  They develop an intimacy that is based partly on their boredom with their domestic situations. Michel and Lena's marriage is fractious, although there are moments of happiness with their two young daughters, and the film is primarily about Lena leaving her husband. At the end of the film, she and Madeleine (who left her own husband sometime earlier, had trouble holding down a job, and went through a nervous breakdown), are about to open a dress shop in Paris. "
wikipedia-10059041," Nociceptin receptor  The nociceptin receptor or NOP also known as the orphanin FQ receptor or kappa-type 3 opioid receptor is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ""OPRL1"" (opioid receptor-like 1) gene. The nociceptin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor whose natural ligand is known as nociceptin or orphanin FQ, a 17 amino acid neuropeptide. This receptor is involved in the regulation of numerous brain activities, particularly instinctive and emotional behaviors. Mechanism. Nociceptin is thought to be an endogenous antagonist of dopamine transport that may act either directly on dopamine or by inhibiting GABA to affect dopamine levels. Within the central nervous system its action can be either similar or opposite to those of opioids depending on their location. It controls a wide range of biological functions ranging from nociception to food intake, from memory processes to cardiovascular and renal functions, from spontaneous locomotor activity to gastrointestinal motility, from anxiety to the control of neurotransmitter release at peripheral and central sites. Selective ligands. Several commonly used opioid drugs including etorphine and buprenorphine have been demonstrated to bind to nociceptin receptors, but this binding is relatively insignificant compared to their activity at other opioid receptors. More recently a range of selective ligands for ORL-1 have been developed, which show little or no affinity to other opioid receptors and so allow ORL-1 mediated responses to be studied in isolation. Applications. ORL 1 agonists are being studied as treatments for heart failure and migraine while nociceptin antagonists such as JTC-801 may have analgesic and antidepressant qualities. The novel drug buprenorphine is a partial agonist at ORL 1 receptors while its metabolite norbuprenorphine is a full agonist at these receptors. "
wikipedia-5053322," .41 Long Colt  The .41 Long Colt cartridge was created in 1877 for Colt's double-action ""Thunderer"" revolver. It was a lengthened version of the earlier centerfire .41 Short Colt, which was made to duplicate the dimensions of the even earlier .41 Short. The front of the bullet was about 0.406""-0.408”OD, the same as the case. The barrel was about 0.404”-0.406” groove diameter. The bullet lubrication was outside of the case. At 0.386”-0.388""OD, The base of the bullet was smaller in diameter to fit inside the case. This is known as a ""heel-base"" or heeled bullet. The only modern heeled bullet is the .22 rimfire. In the mid-1890s, Colt redesigned the cartridge. They reduced the entire diameter of the bullet to 0.386""OD and lengthened the brass case in order to put both the bullet and its lubrication inside the case. The overall length of both loaded cartridges was about the same. The barrel of the revolver was reduced slightly to match the more popular 38-40 at 0.400""-0.401” groove diameter (this was probably done for manufacturing reasons, not accuracy reasons). This meant that the outside diameter (OD) of the new bullet was smaller than the barrel’s bore, let alone its groove diameter. A hollow-base bullet can be dropped down the bore by gravity alone. The newer soft lead bullet was made with a large hollow base, like Civil War Minié balls. The intent was for the base of the bullet to expand with the pressure of the burning gunpowder to grip the rifling. The original 41LC brass cases came in three primary lengths, although they vary quite a bit within a headstamp. The first ones were the shortest at about 0.932” to 0.937” long. In balloon-head cases, they held about 20gr of compressed black powder (BP) with a 200gr flat-bottom, heel-base, blunt-nose bullet. The next cases were about 1.130” to 1.138” long with a 200gr hollow-base, blunt-nose bullet and about 21gr of BP (also in balloon-head cases). Although the brass case lengths were far different, both cartridges were about the same overall length when loaded. The last brass case length was 1.050” to 1.100” long and was created exclusively for hand loaders so that both heel-base and hollow-base bullets could be used interchangeably (note that cartridges made from the longest brass cases and heel-base bullets are too long to fit most 41LC revolvers). The .41 Long Colt worked surprisingly well considering the mismatch of bullet and bore sizes, but by the beginning of WWI it was in serious decline and it fell from use by the beginning of WWII. The accuracy the 41LC is adequate for what it was intended; close range self-defense, its drawback had more to do with the heavy double-action trigger pull of the Thunderer. Elmer Keith wrote in his book """"Sixguns"""" that the ""41LC was a better fight-stopper than its paper ballistics would indicate"" and it was ""better for self-defense than any .38 Special load made"".

wikipedia-2534472," Konstantin Somov  Konstantin Andreyevich Somov (Russian: Константин Андреевич Сомов, November 30, 1869 – May 6, 1939) was a Russian artist associated with the ""Mir iskusstva"". Born into a family of a major art historian and Hermitage Museum curator Andrey Ivanovich Somov, he became interested in the 18th-century art and music at an early age. Somov studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts under Ilya Repin from 1888 to 1897. While at the Academy, he befriended Alexandre Benois, who would introduce him to Sergei Diaghilev and Léon Bakst. When the three founded the ""World of Art"", Somov liberally contributed to its periodicals. Somov was homosexual, like many of the ""World of Art"" members. Inspired by Watteau and Fragonard, he preferred to work with watercolours and gouache. For three years he worked upon his masterpiece, ""Lady in Blue"", painted in the manner of 18th-century portraitists.  During the 1910s, Somov executed a number of rococo harlequin scenes and illustrations to the poems by Alexander Blok. Many of his works were exhibited abroad, especially in Germany, where the first monograph on him was published in 1909.  Following the Russian Revolution, he emigrated to the United States, but found the country ""absolutely alien to his art"" and moved to Paris. He was buried at the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Cemetery.  On June 14, 2007, Somov's landscape ""The Rainbow"" (1927) was sold at Christie's for US$7.33 million, a record for a work at an auction of Russian art. "
wikipedia-7551808," Chew toy  A chew toy is a toy designed to be chewed by animals for purposes of stimulation and relief from boredom . The act of gnawing on a chew toy is soothing and assists small animals, like puppies, in easing the pain of breaking in their adult teeth as the chewing process releases feel-good chemicals from the brain. There are several different types of chew toys, including rawhide, wood, paper and mineral. Chew toys are commonly associated with puppies and dogs, though they are also used for birds, rodents, and rabbits. Chew toys are a vital part of happy, healthy animal's life. In addition to providing hours of entertainment, they also allow the animal to work out anxiety and boredom by being occupied with chewing a toy. Chew toys also distract small animals from chewing on other ""forbidden"" items, and they assist in maintaining healthy teeth. Rawhide. Rawhide chew toys are most often associated with puppies and dogs, though rawhide toys are plentiful in the bird toy section of most pet stores. Rawhide is suitable for all animals except herbivores, as it is made of animal skin. Rabbits, which only eat vegetation, cannot have rawhide toys because their digestive systems cannot process them. This is a rather sturdy kind of chew toy and it can take months for a small animal or bird to destroy. Examples of rawhide chew toys are twists and rawhide bones. Compressed rawhide can dangerously splinter when dry as well as break off in large pieces that may be ingested, and thus are generally not recommended for large breeds of dogs. Chew toys made of leather are not recommended for dogs as they cannot be properly digested in the stomach and may cause blockage in the intestines. Wood. Wood chew toys are made of a safe, non-poisonous, softer wood and are often coated in bright, vegetable-based dyes or paints. Wooden chew toys are given in place of the wood that small animals would find in the wild. They are a safe alternative for a small animal owner to purchase if the owner has no knowledge of the trees and shrubs growing in their area. They are generally used as either small rodents toys or rabbit toys. Wooden chew toys help to keep teeth trimmed down, preventing eating difficulties in pets and unnecessary trips to a vet for teeth clipping. An example of a wooden chew toy is the commercial product toy ropes Paper. Paper chew toys are made of non bleached non-toxic paper. They are an inexpensive, or often free, option for small pet owners and can provide hours of stimulation and play for small animals. One common paper chew toy is an empty toilet paper tube. These can double as tunnels for very small rodents, and can also be used as modified piñatas for larger small animals. Wadded up newspaper pages, old spineless books, and the commercial product ""Chubes"" are other commonly used paper chew toys. Mineral. Mineral chew toys are made of flavored animal-safe minerals. These range from flavored fruit-shaped blocks for birds to ice-cream cone shaped mineral treats for rabbits. They also come shaped as bowls with fluffy minerals inside. A common mineral chew toy is the cuttlebone, a necessity in any bird's cage that helps to keep nails and beaks trimmed and healthy. Rubber. There is a variety of rubber chew toys for dogs on the market that are molded into different shapes. Some of them are hollowed so that treats can be placed in them. This way, the dog has to ""work"" to get a treat. Rubber is a good chew toy for dogs but is unhealthy for small animals "
wikipedia-22827640," Interpretations of Fight Club  The 1999 American film ""Fight Club"", directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter, presents social commentary about consumerist culture, especially the feminization of American culture and its effects on masculinity. The film has been the source of critical analysis. Academics Jans B. Wager describes the film as retro-noir, while Keith Gandal defines it as a ""slumming trauma"". Cultural critics Henry Giroux and Imre Szeman assert that ""Fight Club"" focuses too much on consumerist culture as society's problem. Academic Robert von Dassanowsky describes ""Fight Club"" as an examination of European fascism. Genre classifications. Retro-noir. According to Jans B. Wager, ""Fight Club"" exhibits several film noir characteristics. The film's narrator is a white male protagonist who provides a subjective voice-over. He is involved in ""an erotic triangle"" with ""a female object of desire"" (Marla Singer) and a male antagonist (Tyler Durden), all of whom are white. The white masculinity in the film differs from noir films by focusing on the upper middle class instead of the lower middle class or the working class. Both of the narrator's counterparts are simultaneously like him and dangerous to him, and the plot takes place in ""an urban, crumbling, criminal milieu"". With these characteristics, ""Fight Club"" masquerades as neo-noir. It is instead best classified as a retro-noir since its presentation of gender roles is ""diametrically opposed"" to neo-noir films, which in contrast ""allow their protagonists to survive, thrive, and commit or solve crimes, with and without male companionship or assistance"". The films also present a ""more organic"" heterosexual coupling than ""Fight Club"". The female character is introduced as a ""femme fatale"", wearing a dress, hat, and sunglasses, smoking a cigarette, and possessing ""voluptuous"" red lips. Her presence, regardless of ""action or agency"", is meant to show that ""she is the source of all the problems for the narrator"". The ""femme fatale"" appearance at the beginning is replaced by a heroin chic appearance for the rest of the film. The male antagonist appears in direct response to the ""intrusion"" of this female object of desire, recalling how in some noir films, the ""femme fatale"" appearance is a catalyst to the everyman's entry into ""a criminal and dangerous world"". The female character is presented as ""necessary but peripheral"" since she is never fully aware of what is happening. Cultural critic Henry Giroux describes the nature of Marla Singer as ""an ultra-conservative version of post-1960s femininity that signifies the antithesis of domestic security, comfort, and sexual passitivity"". This brand of post-feminism ties into ""commodities that call for and support constant body maintenance (femininity)"". Marla Singer finds her commodities in others' laundry or thrift stores, so ""she transgresses both through her sexual appetites and her flaunting of the consumption-oriented conventions of femininity"". Slumming trauma. Keith Gandal defines ""Fight Club"" as a ""slumming trauma"" in the sense that it falls between the genres of the sentimental slumming drama and the trauma film. Sentimental slumming dramas avoid ""the sordid"" and ""degraded environment and social interactions"". They contain ""wholesome"" heroes, who and whose counterparts usually have ""young, beautiful faces and bodies"" that do not bruise or do recover easily from bruising. Examples of sentimental slumming dramas include ""Titanic"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", and ""Forrest Gump"". In contrast, trauma films have ""a penchant for disfigurement and disease"", and they exhibit ""blasted"" nihilism in which the films' characters are paralyzed by trauma and even become ""traumatizers"" themselves. Examples of trauma films include ""Gummo"", ""Kids"", and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"". While ""Fight Club"" expresses ""radical"" slumming notions through lines like, ""Only when you've lost everything are you free to do anything,"" the film is hostile to sentimental slumming. Gandal writes of the film's perception, ""Sentimentalism is an insidious lie that denies the realities of human life and the human body as it promises a fairy-tale experience that doesn't exist."" Additionally, one of ""Fight Club""s main characters, Tyler Durden, advocates methods of ""self-actualization and self-discovery"", which are radical compared to those of ""wholesome"" heroes. While slumming dramas avoid physically degraded conditions, ""Fight Club"" embraces the conditions in a manner that ""mystifies and romanticizes the sordid"". This approach differentiates from trauma films' approach of these conditions. Instead of the characters being paralyzed by traumas, the traumas are ""romantic"" traumas that ""shake people awake and remind them that they are alive and full of possibility"". Through fight clubs, ""the desecrated body is a central image in slumming trauma"" with injuries being fetishes in the genre. The romanticism is a paradox in the slumming trauma genre; the characters identify with decay to be ""purifying"" and identify with the degraded to be ""transcendent"". The paradox is hinted not to be very stable; there are suggestions of ""humiliation and self-loathing"". The love object Marla Singer accuses the narrator of having ""serious emotional problems"", and there is anger among fight club members that they won't be ""millionaires and movie gods and rock stars"". The narrator discovers that celebrity treatment as leader of the fight clubs prompts the question of how the narrator cannot be special. Gandal elaborates on the double-sided nature that results from the paradox: ""Either the narrator is discovering his aliveness in the body's vulnerability and power to harm, or he is degrading his body and others' out of traumatic self-loathing and depression... Either the film is pushing humility or indulging in a martial, even fascist, fantasy of celebrity."" Love objects are degraded in trauma films, but in ""Fight Club"", degradation does not last to the film's conclusion. Gandal notes the separation, ""he abusive (and self-abusive) man and the degraded (and self-abusive) woman actually get together in the end—something seemingly unthinkable in a trauma film."" ""Fight Club""s ending has characteristics of slumming dramas' and trauma films' endings. Like the ""wholesome"" heroes, the nameless narrator ascends from ""bohemian depths"", but like in trauma films, the narrator is not ""physically unscathed"", suffering a gunshot wound through his cheek. Despite the protagonist and the love object getting together at the end, the film remains hostile to sentimentality through the display of the gunshot wound and a spliced frame of a penis, one of Tyler Durden's hostile acts during the film. Consumerist culture. Cultural critics Henry Giroux and Imre Szeman describe ""Fight Club"" as a failed critique which focuses on the consumerist culture and how it shapes male identity and ignores how neoliberal capitalism has dominated and exploited society. They write, """"Fight Club"" has nothing substantive to say about the structural violence of unemployment, job insecurity, cuts in public spending, and the destruction of institutions capable of defending social provisions and the public good."" The film is ""dangerously seductive"" because of how it offers through Project Mayhem ""a possible vision of a collective response... however disturbing such a response might be."" The vision, in the form of ""regressive, vicious, and obscene"" politics, is presented as the only possible alternative to defeat contemporary capitalism. ""Fight Club"" is a film that ""very powerfully reveals the astonishing limits of our political imagination"", focusing on masculinity and centering around a ""hip, stylishly violent"" narrative. The critics write, ""It tells us very little... about the real circumstances and causes of our discontent, which lie in a very different place than in the seeming emasculation of that social group that wields perhaps the most concentrated power the world has ever seen—urban, upper-middle class, white, male technocrats."" Giroux and Szeman identify Tyler Durden as a failed icon of the revolution whose public appeal is more due to his cult personality than any ""strengths of an articulated, democratic notion of political reform."" Durden acts instead of thinking and thereby fails to envision democratic movements; he is described as ""a holdover of early-twentieth-century fascism"". While the narrator represents the crisis of capitalism as a crisis of masculinity, Tyler Durden represents ""redemption of masculinity repackaged as the promise of violence in the interests of social and political anarchy"". In the film, Tyler Durden holds Raymond, a young Asian clerk at a convenience store, hostage. Durden threatens to kill Raymond unless the clerk returns to veterinarian school to become a doctor as desired previously. The extortion is flawed because Durden treats choice as an individual act that can be willed through, ignoring societal dynamics. The critics write, ""For Tyler, success is simply a matter of getting off one's backside and forging ahead; individual initiative and sheer force of will magically cancel out institutional constraints, and critiques of the gravity of dominant relations of oppression are dismissed as either an act of bad faith or the unacceptable whine of victimization."" The two critics outline three main absences in ""Fight Club""s critique. First, the film assumes that capitalism and consumerism are ""impenetrable"", and there cannot be resistance or struggle against them. Secondly, the film focuses instead on defending ""authoritarian masculinity."" The fight clubs' violence are complicit with the system of commodification that it denounces because it ties into instant gratification, heightened competitiveness, and ""the market-driven desire"" to dominate and win in fights. Lastly, ""Fight Club"" ascribes to a world under the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes in which cynicism replaces hope. The critics write of this world, ""The survival of the fittest becomes the clarion call for legitimating dehumanizing forms of violence as a source of pleasure and sociality."" They summarize, """"Fight Club"" appears to have no understanding of its own articulation with the very forces of capitalism it appears to be attacking. This is most evident in its linking of violence, masculinity, and gender. In other words, ""Fight Club""s vision of liberation and politics relies on gendered and sexist hierarchies that flow directly from the consumer culture it claims to be criticizing."" ""Fight Club"" is a reminder to have discourse about ethics and politics but its failed critique suggests ""a more sustained and systemic critique"" of societal conditions. Fascism. Robert von Dassanowsky identifies ""Fight Club"", alongside ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Hannibal"", as an American film released at the turn of the 21st century that examines European fascism through cinematic metaphor and explores fascism's cultural and sexual politics. ""Fight Club""s portrayal of the paramilitary Project Mayhem represents a response to the feminization of America, and the portrayal is reminiscent of the creation of Nazism in response to the ""decadent"" Weimar Republic of Germany. In the film, the counter to the feminized male is a model of male that is ""an identity-less, violent and destructively nihilistic cadre that intends to discipline a world gone too tolerant."" The paramilitary members' processing of human fat from liposuction into designer soap is a Holocaust reference. The process surpasses in potency ""Soylent Green""s premise of processing people into food. Dassanowsky writes, "" is not only possible and marketable in the real world, but the very concept of this postmodern self-improvement elitism derives from the most horrific inhumanity in human history."" The film's embodiment of the crisis of masculinity is former bodybuilder Bob Paulson, played by Meat Loaf. As a result of steroid abuse, Paulson has lost his testicles, developed ""bitch tits,"" and become estranged from his family. His body and spirit are crippled by failed modernity's science and technology. He embodies how traditional patriarchy is being lost and how his generation fears feminization. Dassanowsky summarizes: ""Without his testicles and with female breasts Bob has become the extreme metaphor for middle-class, male-led panic in the postmodern era, a setting that features a recasting of the same factors of interwar German angst: dehumanization through (post)modernity and its technology: international economic and geopolitical instability; and lack of trust in social and political concepts and/or the national identity and role."" Paulson is killed accidentally while participating in one of Project Mayhem's ""urban terrorist"" operations. In his death, he becomes ""a mythical icon"" who receives his name back, having previously gone nameless like other members of the Project. The scenario retells how Nazi activist Horst Wessel's own accidental death was exploited by the Nazi movement to portray Wessel as a fallen hero. Dassanowsky observes the effect of Paulson's death and the response to it, ""Mythology and the constructed enemy against which Bob perished in battle obscure the Fight Club's reactionary 'revolution.'"" Another member of Project Mayhem, Angel Face (played by Jared Leto), is disfigured by the narrator in Sadean destruction ""of the 'normal' or ideal as sexual act."" The disfigurement signifies how ""there is no symbolic Other that is victimized or battles fascist oppression."" The narrator himself is unable to recognize his actions as Tyler Durden. He attempts to rid himself of Durden, which is metaphoric of ""the post-war trauma in dealing with fascist destruction."" Fascism arises when humans fear inadequacy and losing social control. Audiences respond eagerly to the film's presentation of fascism, having a base desire ""to experience the forbidden, to see the cornerstones of industry dynamited and collapse."" ""Fight Club"" concludes with the narrator and his female companion watching Project Mayhem's successful detonation of buildings that hold credit card information to reset society's debt. Dassanowsky writes of the conclusion, ""The ecstasy of a fresh start that can not be reversed... as the Narrator and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) hold hands while the buildings sink, as potentially wish-fulfilling as any hyperthyroid promise Hitler may have made to a tired and bruised nation in 1933."" "
wikipedia-3866836," Mavra  Mavra is a one-act opera buffa composed by Igor Stravinsky, and one of the earliest works of Stravinsky's 'neo-classical' period. The libretto of the opera, by Boris Kochno, is based on Aleksandr Pushkin's ""The Little House in Kolomna"". Mavra is about 25 minutes long, and features two arias, a duet, and a quartet performed by its cast of four characters. The opera has been characterised as both an homage to Russian writers, and a satire of bourgeois manners and the ""Romeo and Juliet"" subgenre of romance. Philip Truman has also described the music as satirising 19th century comic opera. The dedication on the score is to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. ""Mavra"" premiered in Paris on June 3, 1922, staged under the auspices of Sergei Diaghilev, with Oda Slobdoskaya among the original cast. The opera was a failure at the premiere, partly because the large space of the Paris Opéra overwhelmed the small scale of the opera. Stravinsky himself thought very highly of this composition, saying once that """"Mavra"" seems to me the best thing I've done"". Erik Satie praised the work after its premiere. Stravinsky himself reacted with hostility to people who criticized it in later years. The opera was given its United States premiere by the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia on December 28, 1934 with Maria Kurenko as Parasha and Alexander Smallens conducting. The Santa Fe Opera mounted ""Mavra"" in 1962. The first aria of the work has been arranged for cello and piano, and recorded with Mstislav Rostropovich under the title ""Russian Song"". Synopsis. Parasha is in love with her neighbour, Vassili, a young hussar, but they have difficulty in meeting. After they sing a duet, Vassili leaves, and then Parasha's mother enters. She is lamenting the difficulty of finding a new maid-servant after their prior maid-servant, Thecla, died. The mother orders her daughter to find a new maid-servant. Parasha comes up with a scheme to smuggle Vassili into her house disguised as Mavra, a female maid-servant. The ruse initially succeeds, and Parasha and Vassili are happy at being under the same roof. Parasha and her mother go out for a walk. At one moment, Vassili shaves. The ladies return, disconcerted to see their new maid-servant shaving. Vassili escapes out the window, her mother faints, the next door neighbour rushes in to try to help, and Parasha laments the loss of her young love. "
wikipedia-270674," Veterans Stadium  Philadelphia Veterans Stadium (informally called ""The Vet"") was a professional-sports, multi-purpose stadium, located at the northeast corner of Broad Street and Pattison Avenue, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The listed seating capacities in 1971 were 62,000 seats for football, and 56,371 for baseball. It housed the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles, from 1971 to 2002 and the National League's Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, from 1971 to 2003. The 1976 and 1996 Major League Baseball All-Star Games were held at the venue. The Vet also hosted the annual Army-Navy football game seventeen times: first in 1980, and last in 2001. In addition to professional baseball and football, the stadium hosted other amateur and professional sports, large entertainment events and other civic affairs. History. Inception, design and construction. As early as 1959, Phillies owner Bob Carpenter proposed building a new ballpark for the Phillies on adjacent to the Garden State Park Racetrack in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The Phillies' then-home, Connie Mack Stadium, was starting to show its age (it had been built in 1909) and did not have sufficient parking. Also, at the time alcohol was banned at sporting events in Pennsylvania, but was legal in New Jersey. The proposed ballpark would have seated 45,000 fans, been expandable to 60,000, and would have had 15,000 parking spaces. The American League's Philadelphia Athletics had moved to Kansas City, Missouri after the 1954 season, and Philadelphians weren't about to lose another professional sports franchise. In 1964, Philadelphia voters approved a US$25-million-bond issue for a new stadium to serve as the home of both the Eagles (who played at the University of Pennsylvania's Franklin Field) and the Phillies. Because of cost overruns, the voters had to go to the polls again in 1967 to approve another $13 million. At a total cost of $50 million, it was one of the most-expensive ballparks to date. The stadium was named by the Philadelphia City Council, in 1968, for the veterans of all wars. As early as December 1969, the Phillies expected that they would play the first month of the 1970 season at Connie Mack Stadium before moving to the new venue. However, the opening was delayed a year because of a combination of bad weather and cost overruns. The stadium's design was nearly circular, and was known as an ""octorad"" design, which attempted to facilitate both football and baseball. Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego had been similarly designed. As was the case with other cities where this dual approach was tried (other examples include RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C.; Shea Stadium in New York City, the Astrodome in Houston; Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta; Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis; Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati; and Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh), the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of the playing fields made the stadium inadequate to the needs of either sport. First game. The Phillies played their first game at the stadium on Saturday, April 10, 1971, beating the Montreal Expos, 4–1, before an audience of 55,352. Jim Bunning (named to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996) was the winning pitcher while Bill Stoneman took the loss. Entertainer Mike Douglas, whose daily talk show was taped in Philadelphia, sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" before the game. The emcee for the opening ceremonies was newly arrived Harry Kalas. Boots Day opened the game by grounding out to Bunning. Larry Bowa had the stadium's first hit and Don Money slugged the first home run. Final games. As the stadium aged, its condition deteriorated. A hole in the wall allowed visiting teams' players to peep into the Eagles Cheerleaders dressing room. So many mice infested the stadium that the security force employed cats as mousers. The final football game played at the Vet was the Eagles' 27–10 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC Championship Game on January 19, 2003. The Eagles moved into Lincoln Financial Field in August 2003. The final game ever played at the stadium was the afternoon of September 28, 2003, during which the Phillies lost to the Atlanta Braves. However, the ceremony that followed pulled at the heartstrings of the sellout crowd. Both Paul Owens, a former general manager, and Tug McGraw, a former pitcher, made their final public appearances at the park that day; later that winter both men died. The last publicly broadcast words uttered in the park were by Harry Kalas — a veteran announcer who helped open the facility on April 10, 1971 — who paraphrased his trademark home run call: ""And now, Veterans Stadium is like a 3-1 pitch to Jim Thome or Mike Schmidt. ""It's on a looooooong drive...IT'S OUTTA HERE!!!"""" The team moved into Citizens Bank Park in 2004, with the first game being played there on April 12, 2004. Demolition and commemoration. On March 21, 2004, the 32-year-old stadium was imploded in 62 seconds. Frank Bardonaro, President of Philadelphia-based AmQuip Crane Rental Company pressed the ""charge"" button and then he and Nick Peetros, Project Manager for Driscoll/Hunt Construction Company simultaneously pressed the ""fire"" button to trigger the implosion while Greg Luzinski and the Phillie Phanatic, the Phillies' mascot, pressed a plunger for the fans. A parking lot for the current sporting facilities was constructed in 2004 and 2005 at the site. On June 6, 2005, the anniversary of World War II's D-Day, a plaque and monument to commemorate the spot where the stadium stood and a memorial for all veterans was dedicated by the Phillies before their game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. On September 28, 2005, the second anniversary of the stadium's final game, a historical marker commemorating where the ballpark once stood was dedicated. In April 2006, granite spaces marking the former locations of home plate, the pitcher's mound, and the three bases for baseball, as well as the goalpost placements for football, were added in Western Parking Lot U. Stadium features. The stadium was a complicated structure with its seating layered in seven separate levels. The lowest, or ""100 Level"", extended only part way around the structure, between roughly the 25-yard lines for football games and near the two dugouts for baseball. The ""200 Level"" comprised field-level boxes, and the ""300 Level"" housed what were labeled ""Terrace Boxes"". These three levels collectively made up the ""Lower Stands"". The ""400 Level"" was reserved for the press and dignitaries; the upper level began with ""500 Level"" (or ""loge boxes""), the ""600 Level"" (upper reserved, or individual seats), and finally, the 700 Level (general admission for baseball). Originally, the seats were in shades of brown, terra cotta, orange and yellow, to look like an autumn day, but in 1995 and 1996, blue seats replaced the fall-hued ones. At one time, the stadium could seat over 71,000 people for football, but restructuring in the late 1980s brought capacity down to around 66,000. The stadium was harshly criticized by baseball purists. Even by multi-purpose-stadium standards, the upper deck was exceptionally high, and many of the seats in that area were so far from the field that it was difficult to see the game without binoculars. Like most of its contemporaries, foul territory was quite roomy. Approximately 70 percent of the seats were in foul territory, adding to the stadium's cavernous feel. There was no dirt in the infield except for sliding pits around the bases. In the autumn, the football markings were clearly visible in the spacious outfield area. Although the stadium's size enabled the Phillies to shatter previous attendance records, during the years the Phillies were not doing as well even crowds of 35,000 looked sparse. The stadium had been known for providing both the Eagles and the Phillies with great home-field advantage. In particular, the acoustics greatly enhanced the crowd noise on the field, making it nearly impossible for opposing teams to hear one another. 700 Level. The ""700 Level"" was well known for being home to the rowdiest fans at Philadelphia Eagles games, and to a lesser extent, Philadelphia Phillies games. In his book ""If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer?"", Jereé Longman described the 700 Level as having a reputation for ""hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness."" Due to an improvement in facilities, there is no equivalent in either Lincoln Financial Field or Citizens Bank Park. The name has also been the inspiration for websites relating to Philadelphia sports, as well as a weekly ""Letters to the Editor"" section in the Sunday Sports pages of ""The Philadelphia Inquirer"". Playing surface. The field's surface, originally composed of AstroTurf, contained many gaps and uneven patches. In several places, seams were clearly visible, giving it the nickname ""Field of Seams"". It perennially drew the ranking of the ""NFL's worst field"" in player surveys conducted by the NFL Players Association, and visiting players often fell prey to the treacherous conditions resulting in numerous injuries. The NFLPA reportedly threatened to sue the city for the poor conditions, and many sports agents told the Eagles not to even consider signing or drafting their clients. The Eagles, for their part, complained to the city on numerous occasions about the conditions at the stadium. Baseball players also complained about the surface. It was much harder than other AstroTurf surfaces, and the shock of running on it often caused back pain. Two of the most-publicized injuries blamed on the playing surface occurred exactly six years apart. On October 10, 1993, Bears receiver Wendell Davis had his cleat get caught in a seam while running a simple pass route. He tore both of his patella tendons, ending his career. On October 10, 1999, Michael Irvin suffered a neck injury that led to his premature retirement. (The previously winless Eagles rallied from a 10–0 deficit and won 13–10.). In 2001, the original AstroTurf was eventually replaced by a new surface, NexTurf. It was far softer, and reportedly much easier on the knees. However, the city crew that installed the new turf reportedly did not install it properly, resulting in seams being visible in several places. The first football game on the new turf was scheduled to take place on August 13, 2001, when the Eagles were to play the Baltimore Ravens in a preseason game. However, Ravens coach Brian Billick refused to let the Ravens take the field for warm-ups when he discovered a trench around an area where third base was covered up by a NexTurf cutout. City crews unsuccessfully tried to fix the problem, forcing the game to be canceled. Later, players from both teams reported that they sank into the turf in locations near the infield cutouts. Team president Joe Banner was irate after the game, calling the stadium's conditions ""absolutely unacceptable"" and ""an embarrassment to the city of Philadelphia."" City officials, however, promised that the stadium would be suitable for play when the regular season started. The problem was caused by heavy rain over the weekend prior to the game, which made the dirt in the sliding pits and pitcher's mound so soft that the cutouts covering them in the football configuration became mushy and uneven. Even when new dirt was shoveled on top, it quickly became just as saturated as the old dirt. The problem was solved by using asphalt hot mix, which allowed for a solid, level playing surface, but required a jackhammer for removal whenever the stadium was converted from football back to baseball (between August and October of each year). Fans. Fans who attended games in the stadium for a football game gained a reputation of being among the most vociferous in sports, especially those in the notorious 700 Level, the highest seating level in the stadium prior to the construction of luxury skyboxes behind that seating area. The stadium became famous for the rowdiness of Eagles fans, although it was not the site of the incident in which fans booed Santa Claus during a halftime show. (The Santa Claus incident occurred on December 15, 1968, at Franklin Field, the Eagles' home stadium at the time.) One of the more well-known examples of the fans' behavior was during the 1989 season at a follow-up game to what many called the ""Bounty Bowl"". On Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 1989, the Eagles had defeated the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium, 27-0. In that game, Cowboys placekicker Luis Zendejas suffered a concussion during a rough block by linebacker Jessie Small after a kickoff. After the game, Cowboys rookie head coach Jimmy Johnson commented that Eagles coach Buddy Ryan instituted a bounty on Zendejas and Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman. Two weeks later, on December 10, they played the rematch dubbed ""Bounty Bowl II"" at the stadium which the Eagles won 20-10. The stadium seats were covered with snow in the stands. The volatile mix of beer, the ""bounty"" and the intense hatred for ""America's Team"" (who were 1–15 that season) led to fans throwing snowballs at Dallas players and coaches. Beer sales were banned after that incident for two games. A similar incident in 1995 at Giants Stadium during a nationally telecast San Diego Chargers–New York Giants game led the NFL to rule that seating areas must be cleared of snow within a certain time period before kickoff. The Eagles fans' behavior during a ""Monday Night Football"" loss to the San Francisco 49ers in 1997 and a 34-0 loss to Dallas a year later was such that the City of Philadelphia assigned a Municipal Court Judge, Seamus McCaffrey, to the stadium on game days to deal with fans removed from the stands in what was referred to as ""Eagles Court"". Two years later, fans threw D-Cell batteries at St. Louis Cardinals outfielder J.D. Drew after he spurned the Phillies' offer to play with them, and wound up going back into the draft and picked by the Cardinals. Other events at Veterans Stadium. Amateur baseball. The Liberty Bell Classic, Philadelphia Division I college baseball tournament, was played at the stadium from its inception in 1992 through 2003. The original eight schools were: In the first championship game in 1992, Delaware defeated Villanova 6-2. The stadium hosted the 1998 Atlantic 10 Conference Baseball Tournament, won by Fordham. Minor League baseball. In November 1987, the new owners of the Phillies AAA franchise, the Maine Guides, considered playing the 1988 season at the Vet because Lackawanna County Stadium would not be ready until the 1989 season. The team would have had to play 12:35pm day games when the Phillies had night games scheduled at the Vet. Ownership elected to remain in Old Orchard Beach for 1988, renamed the club the 'Maine Phillies', and moved to Moosic, PA in 1989 as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons. The Eastern League Trenton Thunder played two home games at the stadium in April 1994. The Thunder beat the Canton-Akron Indians, 10 to 9, in front of 483 fans on April 20, 1994, and won 9 to 3 on April 21. Future Phillies broadcaster Tom McCarthy was in the booth for the Thunder during these two games. Soccer. The stadium was the home field for the Philadelphia Atoms and the Philadelphia Fury, both North American Soccer League teams. The Fury drew 18,191 fans for their April 1, 1978, opener at the stadium which they lost 3-0 to the Washington Diplomats. The Fury averaged 8,279 per-match in 1978 NASL, 5,624 per-match in 1979 NASL, and 4,778 in the 1980 NASL seasons. The club was moved to Montreal in 1981 NASL season. The stadium hosted an exhibition match on August 2, 1991, between the U.S. National Team and English professional soccer club Sheffield Wednesday. John Harkes played for Wednesday, the first American to play in the English Premier League. 44,261 fans saw the U.S. score two second-half goals to defeat Sheffield Wednesday 2-0. Philadelphia established a bid committee to host matches for the 1994 World Cup which was to be played in the United States. Phillies president Bill Giles was on the Philadelphia bid committee and hoped to use Veterans Stadium for games. In addition to the challenge of installing a natural grass field for the games, FIFA would have required the Phillies to vacate the stadium for a month to allow for sufficient preparation time prior to the matches. Giles could only offer 17-days. Of the nine venues eventually chosen to host matches, not one was home to a professional baseball club. High school football. Veterans Stadium hosted Philadelphia's City Title high-school football championship game from 1973 to 1977 and in 1979. The series was suspended in 1980. With the entry of the Philadelphia Catholic League into what is now PIAA District XII (which was formed when the Public League joined the PIAA in 2002), the ""City Title Game"" was restored in 2008. Professional wrestling. The only professional wrestling event held in Veterans Stadium was National Wrestling Alliance/Jim Crockett Promotions ""Great American Bash"" on July 1, 1986, with an attendance of 10,900. The event was the start of a 14 city stop summer tour. Concerts. The stadium has hosted many stadium concerts, by famous artists of many different genres. Other events. The venue also played host to religious events including annual Jehovah's Witnesses conventions, which was open to the public each year it took place. It also played host to a Billy Graham crusade in 1992. "
wikipedia-942255," Nuclear navy  Nuclear navy, or nuclear-powered navy consists of ships powered by relatively small onboard nuclear reactors known as naval reactors. The concept was revolutionary for naval warfare when first proposed, as it meant that these vessels did not need to stop for fuel like their conventional counterparts, being limited only by crew endurance and supplies. Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The United States Navy has by far the most nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, with ten in service as of 1 December 2012, when the USS Enterprise CVN-65 was deactivated. France's latest aircraft carrier, the ""R91 Charles de Gaulle"", is nuclear-powered. The United Kingdom rejected nuclear power early in the development of its ""Queen Elizabeth""-class aircraft carriers on cost grounds, as even several decades of fuel use costs less than a nuclear reactor. Nuclear-powered submarines. The United States Navy operates the largest fleet of nuclear submarines. Only the United States Navy, the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, and France's ""Marine Nationale"" field an all-nuclear submarine force. By 1989, there were over 400 nuclear-powered submarines operational or being built. Some 250 of these submarines have now been scrapped and some on order cancelled, due to weapons reduction programs. Russia and the United States had over one hundred each, with the United Kingdom and France fewer than twenty each and China six. The Indian Navy launched their first indigenous ""Arihant"" class nuclear-powered submarines on 26 July 2009. India is also reported to be leasing two additional nuclear submarines from Russia. Nuclear-powered submarines can stay submerged for up to 400 days if the vessel is fully loaded. Other nuclear-powered vessels. The United States no longer has nuclear cruisers. Russia has four ""Kirov""-class battlecruisers, though only one is active, the other three being laid up. The Soviet command ship ""SSV-33 Ural"", based on the Kirov class, is also laid up. Seven civilian nuclear icebreakers remain in service: four of six Arktika class icebreakers, ""Taymyr"", ""Vaygach"", and the LASH carrier and container ship ""Sevmorput"". The United States Navy. The U.S. Navy has accumulated over 5,400 ""reactor years"" of accident-free experience, and operates more than 80 nuclear-powered ships. Admiral Hyman G. Rickover. Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, (1900–1986), of the United States Navy, known as ""father of the nuclear navy"" was an electrical engineer by training, and was the primary architect who implemented this daring concept, and believed that it was the natural next phase for the way military vessels could be propelled and powered. The challenge was to reduce the size of a nuclear reactor to fit on board a ship or submarine, as well as to encase it sufficiently so that radiation hazards would not be a safety concern. Soon after World War II, Rickover was assigned to the Bureau of Ships in September 1947 and received training in nuclear power at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In February 1949 he received an assignment to the Division of Reactor Development, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and then assumed control of the United States Navy's effort as Director of the Naval Reactors Branch in the Bureau of Ships. This dual role allowed him to lead the efforts to develop the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, USS ""Nautilus"" (SSN 571), which was launched in 1954. As Vice Admiral, from 1958, for three decades Rickover exercised tight control over the ships, technology, and personnel of the nuclear navy, even interviewing every prospective officer for new nuclear-powered navy vessels. Philip Abelson. Leading nuclear physicist Philip Abelson (1913–2004) turned his attention under the guidance of Ross Gunn to applying nuclear power to naval propulsion. Their early efforts at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) provided an early glimpse at what was to become the nuclear Navy. United States Naval reactors. At the present time, many important vessels in the United States Navy are powered by naval reactors. All submarines and aircraft carriers are nuclear-powered. Several cruisers were nuclear-powered but these have all been retired. United States naval reactors are given three-character designations consisting of a letter representing the ship type the reactor is designed for, a consecutive generation number, and a letter indicating the reactor's designer. The ship types are ""A"" for aircraft carrier, ""C"" for cruiser, ""D"" for destroyer, and ""S"" for submarine. The designers are ""W"" for Westinghouse, ""G"" for General Electric, ""C"" for Combustion Engineering, and ""B"" for Bechtel. Examples are S5W, D1G, A4W, and D2W. Most information concerning United States naval reactors is not secret—see Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information. "

wikipedia-25597820," Lucretia Mott  Lucretia Coffin Mott (January 3, 1793 – November 11, 1880) was an American Quaker, abolitionist, a women's rights activist, and a social reformer. Early life and education. Lucretia Coffin was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts, the second child of eight by Anna (Folger) and Thomas Coffin. At the age of thirteen, she was sent to the Nine Partners Quaker Boarding School in what is now Millbrook, Dutchess County, New York, which was run by the Society of Friends. There she became a teacher after graduation. Her interest in women's rights began when she discovered that male teachers at the school were paid three times as much as the female staff. After her family moved to Philadelphia, she and James Mott, another teacher at Nine Partners, followed. Marriage and family. On April 10, 1811, Lucretia Coffin married James Mott at Pine Street Meeting in Philadelphia. They had six children. Their second child, Thomas Coffin, died at age two. Their surviving children all became active in the anti-slavery and other reform movements. Early anti-slavery efforts. Like many Quakers, Mott considered slavery an evil to be opposed. Inspired in part by minister Elias Hicks, she and other Quakers refused to use cotton cloth, cane sugar, and other slavery-produced goods. In 1821 Mott became a Quaker minister. With her husband's support, she traveled extensively as a minister, and her sermons emphasized the Quaker inward light, or the presence of the Divine within every individual. Her sermons also included her free produce and anti-slavery sentiments. In 1830, her husband helped found the America Anti-Slavery Society. By then an experienced minister and abolitionist, Lucretia Mott was the only woman to speak at the organizational meeting in Philadelphia. She tested the language of the society's Constitution and bolstered support when many delegates were precarious. Days after the conclusion of the convention, at the urging of other delegates, Mott and other white and black women founded the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. Integrated from its founding, the organization opposed both slavery and racism, and developed close ties to Philadelphia's Black community. Mott herself often preached at Black parishes. Around this time, Mott's sister-in-law, Abigail Lydia Mott, and brother-in-law, Lindley Murray Moore were helping to found the Rochester Anti-Slavery Society. Amidst social persecution by abolition opponents and pain from dyspepsia, Mott continued her work for the abolitionist cause. She managed their household budget to extend hospitality to guests, including fugitive slaves, and donated to charities. Mott was praised for her ability to maintain her household while contributing to the cause. In the words of one editor, ""She is proof that it is possible for a woman to widen her sphere without deserting it."" Mott and other female abolitionists also organized fairs to raise awareness and revenue, providing much of the funding for the anti-slavery movement. Women's participation in the anti-slavery movement threatened societal norms. Many members of the abolitionist movement opposed public activities by women, especially public speaking. At the Congregational Church General Assembly, delegates agreed on a pastoral letter warning women that lecturing directly defied St. Paul's instruction for women to keep quiet in church. Other people opposed women's speaking to mixed crowds of men and women, which they called ""promiscuous."" Others were uncertain about what was proper, as the rising popularity of the Grimké sisters and other women speakers attracted support for abolition. Mott attended all three national Anti-Slavery Conventions of American Women (1837, 1838, 1839). During the 1838 convention in Philadelphia, a mob destroyed Pennsylvania Hall, a newly opened meeting place built by abolitionists. Mott and the white and black women delegates linked arms to exit the building safely through the crowd. Afterward, the mob targeted her home and Black institutions and neighborhoods in Philadelphia. As a friend redirected the mob, Mott waited in her parlor, willing to face her violent opponents. World's Anti-Slavery Convention. In June 1840 Mott attended the General Anti-Slavery Convention, better known as the World's Anti-Slavery Convention, in London, England. In spite of Mott's status as one of six women delegates, before the conference began, the men voted to exclude the American women from participating, and the female delegates were required to sit in a segregated area. Anti-Slavery leaders didn't want the women's rights issue to become associated with the cause of ending slavery worldwide and dilute the focus on abolition. In addition, the social mores of the time generally prohibited women's participation in public political life. Several of the American men attending the convention, including William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, protested the women's exclusion. Garrison, Nathaniel P. Rogers, William Adams, and African American activist Charles Lenox Remond sat with the women in the segregated area. Activists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her husband Henry B. Stanton attended the convention while on their honeymoon. Stanton admired Mott, and the two women became friends and allies. One Irish reporter deemed her the ""Lioness of the Convention"". Mott was among the women included in the commemorative painting of the convention, which also featured female British activists: Elizabeth Pease, Mary Anne Rawson, Anne Knight, Elizabeth Tredgold and Mary Clarkson, daughter of Thomas Clarkson. Encouraged by active debates in England and Scotland, Mott also returned with new energy for the anti-slavery cause in the United States. She continued an active public lecture schedule, with destinations including the major Northern cities of New York and Boston, as well as travel over several weeks to slave-owning states, with speeches in Baltimore, Maryland and other cities in Virginia. She arranged to meet with slave owners to discuss the morality of slavery. In the District of Columbia, Mott timed her lecture to coincide with the return of Congress from Christmas recess; more than 40 Congressmen attended. She had a personal audience with President John Tyler who, impressed with her speech, said, ""I would like to hand Mr. Calhoun over to you."" He was referring to John C. Calhoun, a senator and abolition opponent. Seneca Falls Convention. Mott and Stanton became well acquainted at the World's Anti-Slavery Convention. Stanton later recalled that they first discussed the possibility of a women's rights convention in London. In 1848 Mott and Stanton organized a women's rights convention at Seneca Falls, New York. Stanton noted the Seneca Falls Convention was the first public women's rights meeting in the United States. Stanton's resolution that it was ""the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves the sacred right to the elective franchise"" was passed despite Mott's opposition. Mott viewed politics as corrupted by slavery and moral compromises, but she soon concluded that women's ""right to the elective franchise however, is the same, and should be yielded to her, whether she exercises that right or not."" Mott signed the Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments. Over the next few decades, women's suffrage became the focus of the women's rights movement. While Stanton is usually credited as the leader of that effort, it was Mott's mentoring of Stanton and their work together that inspired the event. Mott's sister, Martha Coffin Wright, also helped organize the convention and signed the declaration. Noted abolitionist and human rights activist Frederick Douglass was in attendance and played a key role in persuading the other attendees to agree to a resolution calling for women's suffrage. Opinions. Women's rights activists advocated a range of issues, including equality in marriage, such as women's property rights and rights to their earnings. At that time it was very difficult to obtain divorce, and fathers were always granted custody of children. Stanton sought to make divorce easier to obtain and to safeguard women's access to and control of their children. Though some early feminists disagreed, and viewed Stanton's proposal as scandalous, Mott stated ""her great faith in Elizabeth Stanton's quick instinct & clear insight in all appertaining to women's rights."" Mott's theology was influenced by Unitarians including Theodore Parker and William Ellery Channing as well as early Quakers including William Penn. She thought that ""the kingdom of God is within man"" (1749) and was part of the group of religious liberals who formed the Free Religious Association in 1867, with Rabbi Wise, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Her theological position was particularly influential among Quakers, as in the future many harked back to her positions, sometimes without even knowing it. American Equal Rights Association. After the Civil War, Mott was elected the first president of the American Equal Rights Association, an organization that advocated universal suffrage, but Mott resigned from the association in 1868 when Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony allied with a controversial businessman named George Francis Train. Mott tried to reconcile the two factions that split the following year over the priorities of woman suffrage and Black male suffrage. Ever the peacemaker, Mott tried to heal the breach between Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone over the immediate goal of the women's movement: suffrage for freedmen and all women, or suffrage for freedmen first? Writing. In 1849, Mott's ""Sermon to the Medical Students"" was published. In 1850, Mott published her speech ""Discourse on Woman"", a pamphlet about restrictions on women in the United States. In general, as a Quaker preacher, Mott spoke from the divine light within, and she never wrote down her sermons or speeches. She seldom wrote anything for publication. Yet her speaking abilities made her an important abolitionist, feminist, and reformer. When slavery was outlawed in 1865, she advocated giving Black Americans the right to vote. She remained a central figure in the abolition and suffrage movement until her death in 1880. Swarthmore. In 1864 Mott and several other Hicksite Quakers incorporated Swarthmore College located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which today remains one of the premier liberal-arts colleges in the United States. Organizations. Mott was involved in a number of anti-slavery organizations, including the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society (founded 1838), the American Free Produce Association, and the American Anti-Slavery Society. In 1866 Mott joined with Stanton, Anthony, and Stone to establish the American Equal Rights Association. The following year, the organization became active in Kansas where black suffrage and woman suffrage were to be decided by popular vote, and it was then that Stanton and Anthony formed a political alliance with Train, leading to Mott's resignation. Kansas failed to pass both referenda. Mott was a pacifist, and in the 1830s, she attended meetings of the New England Non-Resistance Society. She opposed the War with Mexico. After the Civil War, Mott increased her efforts to end war and violence, and she was a leading voice in the Universal Peace Union, founded in 1866. Mott was a founder and president of the Northern Association for the Relief and Employment of Poor Women in Philadelphia (founded 1846). Death. Mott died on November 11, 1880 of pneumonia at her home, Roadside, in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania. She was buried in the Quaker Fairhill Burial Ground in North Philadelphia. She is commemorated in a sculpture by Pablo Picasso at the Carrier Dome, Syracuse, unveiled in 1997. Legacy. Susan Jacoby writes, ""When Mott died in 1880, she was widely judged by her contemporaries... as the greatest American woman of the nineteenth century."" She was a mentor to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who continued her work. Mott's great-granddaughter served briefly as the Italian interpreter for American feminist Betty Friedan during a controversial speaking engagement in Rome. "
wikipedia-12545698," Certified Emission Reduction  Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) are a type of emissions unit (or carbon credits) issued by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Board for emission reductions achieved by CDM projects and verified by a DOE under the rules of the Kyoto Protocol.  CERs can be used by Annex 1 countries in order to comply with their emission limitation targets or by operators of installations covered by the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) in order to comply with their obligations to surrender EU Allowances, CERs or Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) for the emissions of their installations. CERs can be held by governmental and private entities on electronic accounts with the UN.  CERs can be purchased from the primary market (purchased from original party that makes the reduction) or secondary market (resold from a marketplace). At present, most of the approved CERs are recorded in CDM Registry accounts only. It is only when the CER is actually sitting in an operator's trading account that its value can be monetized through being traded. The UNFCCC's International Transaction Log has already validated and transferred CERs into the accounts of some national climate registries, although European operators are waiting for the European Commission to facilitate the transfer of their units into the registries of their Member States. Temporary CERs and Long CERs are special types of CERs issued for forestry projects. They are two ways of accounting for non-permanence in forestry CDM project activities. Temporary CER or tCER is a CER issued for an afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM which expires at the end of the commitment period following the one during which it was issued. Long-term CER or lCER is a CER issued for an afforestation or reforestation project activity which expires at the end of its crediting period. In August 2008 prices for CERS were $20 a tonne. By September 2012, prices for CERS had collapsed to below $5. This was in response to the Eurozone debt crisis reducing industrial activity and the over-allocation of emission allowances under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. The ""The Economist"" described the Clean Development Mechanism as a ""complete disaster in the making"" and ""in need of a radical overhaul"". ""The Guardian"" also reported the prolonged downward trend in the price of CERs, which had been traded for as much as $20 (£12.50) a tonne before the global financial crisis to less than $3. In October 2012, CER prices fell to a new low of 1.36 euros a tonne on the London ICE Futures Europe exchange. In October 2012 Thomson Reuters Point Carbon calculated that the oversupply of units from the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation would be 1,400 million units for the period up to 2020. Point Carbon predicted that CER prices would to drop from €2 to 50 cents. On 12 December 2012 CER prices reached another record low of 31 cents. "
wikipedia-1118396," Chicago Pile-1  Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1) was the world's first nuclear reactor. The construction of CP-1 was part of the Manhattan Project, and was carried out by the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. It was built under the west stands of the original Stagg Field. The first man made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of Enrico Fermi. Fermi described the apparatus as ""a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers."" Made of a large amount of graphite and uranium, with ""control rods"" of cadmium, indium, and silver, unlike subsequent reactors, it had no radiation shield and no cooling system.  The site is now a National Historic Landmark and a Chicago Landmark. Reactor. The reactor was a ""pile"" of uranium pellets and graphite blocks, assembled under the supervision of the renowned physicist Enrico Fermi, in collaboration with Leó Szilárd, discoverer of the chain reaction, and assisted by Martin Whittaker, Walter Zinn, and George Weil. It contained a critical mass of fissile material (when moderated by the graphite), together with control rods. The shape of the pile was intended to be roughly spherical, but as work proceeded Fermi calculated that critical mass could be achieved without finishing the entire pile as planned. CP-1 was originally to be built in Red Gate Woods, a forest preserve outside the city, but a labor strike prevented this. So Fermi built the ""pile"" under the west stands of Stagg Field, the University's abandoned football stadium, in a space that had been used as a rackets court. In the pile, the neutron-producing uranium pellets were separated from one another by graphite blocks. Some of the free neutrons produced by the natural decay of uranium would be absorbed by other uranium atoms, causing nuclear fission of those atoms and the release of additional free neutrons. The graphite between the uranium pellets was a neutron moderator; it slowed the neutrons, increasing the chance they would be absorbed. Fermi himself described the apparatus as ""a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers."" The controls were rods made of cadmium, indium, and silver. Cadmium and indium absorb neutrons; silver becomes radioactive when irradiated by neutrons, which is used for measuring their flux. When the rods were inserted into the pile, the cadmium absorbed free neutrons, preventing the chain reaction. As the rods were withdrawn, more neutrons would strike uranium atoms, until a self-sustaining chain reaction developed. Re-inserting the rods would dampen the reaction. The pile required an enormous amount of graphite and uranium. At the time, there was a limited source of pure uranium. Frank Spedding of Iowa State University was able to produce only two short tons of pure uranium. Additional three short tons of uranium metal was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant which was produced in a rush with makeshift process. A large square balloon was constructed by Goodyear Tire to encase the pile. First nuclear chain reaction. On 2 December 1942, CP-1 was ready for a demonstration. Before a group of dignitaries, George Weil worked the final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. The pile ""went critical"" (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi shut it down 28 minutes later. After the chain reaction was observed, Arthur Compton, head of the Metallurgical Laboratory, notified James Conant, chairman of the National Defense Research Committee, by telephone. The conversation was in an impromptu code: Unlike most reactors that have been built since, CP-1 had no radiation shielding and no cooling system of any kind. Fermi had convinced Arthur Compton that his calculations were reliable enough to rule out a runaway chain reaction or an explosion. But, as the official historians of the Atomic Energy Commission later noted, the ""gamble"" remained in conducting ""a possibly catastrophic experiment in one of the most densely populated areas of the nation!"" Later operation. Operation of CP-1 was terminated in February 1943. The pile was then dismantled and moved to Red Gate Woods. There it was reconstructed using the original materials, plus an enlarged radiation shield, and renamed Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). CP-2 began operation in March 1943 and was later buried at the same site, now known as the Site A/Plot M Disposal Site. CP-2 and other activities at the Red Gate Woods site led to it becoming the first site of Argonne National Laboratory. Significance and commemoration. The site of CP-1 was designated as a National Historic Landmark on 18 February 1965. When the National Register of Historic Places was created in 1966, it was immediately added to that as well. The site was named a Chicago Landmark on 27 October 1971. It is one of the four Registered Chicago Historic Places on the initial National Register. The site of the old Stagg Field is now occupied by the University's Regenstein Library. A Henry Moore sculpture, ""Nuclear Energy"", stands in a small quadrangle just outside the Library, to commemorate the nuclear experiment. A small graphite block from CP-1 can be seen at the Bradbury Science Museum in Los Alamos, New Mexico; another is currently on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. "
wikipedia-1498881," Derek and Clive  Derek and Clive is a double act of comedic characters created by Dudley Moore (Derek) and Peter Cook (Clive) in the 1970s. The performances were captured on the records ""Derek and Clive (Live)"" (1976), ""Derek and Clive Come Again"" (1977), and ""Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam"" (1978), as well as in a film documentary, ""Derek and Clive Get the Horn"" (1979). A greatest hits album containing some previously unreleased material, called ""Rude & Rare The Best of Derek and Clive"", was released in 2011. The characters are foul-mouthed extensions of the earlier characters Pete and Dud.  Considered highly offensive by many at the time, the sketches primarily took the form of bizarre, sometime drunken streams of consciousness led by Cook, with interjections from Moore. Memorable moments from the records include Clive claiming that the worst job he ever had was retrieving lobsters from Jayne Mansfield's arsehole, Derek claiming his worst job was cleaning up Winston Churchill's bogeys (leading the pair to conclude that the ""Titanic"" was one such bogey), Clive claiming that he was sexually aroused by the sight of a deceased Pope lying in state, and a horse-racing 'commentary' featuring horses named after sexual organs or their vulgarised derivatives. Though the recordings were far too crude for a mainstream audience, Derek and Clive bootleg recordings circulated. They were mostly unscripted dialogues incorporating copious swearing - including frequent use of the word ""cunt"". Characters. The characters, supposedly two lavatory attendants (although in one sketch, 'Back of the Cab', they play the roles of two London taxi drivers) first surfaced in the mid-1970s. Development of the show. Cook and Moore were touring Broadway with their revue show ""Good Evening"", a live version of their television series ""Not Only... But Also"". The relationship between the two men had become strained as a result of Cook's worsening alcoholism. To reassure Moore, Cook hired a recording studio in New York, where the two could simply relax, drink and ad-lib. The resulting recording was padded out with live performances of old favourites, such as ""Bo Duddley"" and began to circulate as ""Derek and Clive (Live)"". Cook became bemused at the idea that they should not be making money from the increasing popularity of Derek and Clive, and suggested to Moore that the recording should be released officially. By this point, Moore had embarked on a successful Hollywood film career and found the tapes embarrassing, until he too realised his contemporaries were fans.  Two more records were made. They were less like dialogues and more like vindictive attacks on the increasingly successful Moore by Cook, whose career had stalled somewhat in comparison. One such merciless assault was in a cancer themed diatribe when Cook was fully aware that Moore had recently lost his father to the disease. The same love-hate relationship between them is evident in the ""Derek and Clive Get the Horn"" movie. It is often mistakenly assumed that all of their releases were recorded while under the influence of alcohol. While this can be presumed of ""Come Again"" - where the sounds of bottles can be heard in the background, featuring some tracks where both Cook and Moore are slurring their words - the home video release of ""Derek and Clive Get the Horn"" shows a very sober looking Cook and Moore drinking coffee and water throughout. During the filming, a prank was played upon Cook and Moore by Richard Branson where 'police' arrive and suspiciously sniff the contents of an ash tray to the dismay of the unnerved and wary pair.  Later CD releases of ""Come Again"" and ""Ad Nauseam"" featured out-takes, most were recorded during the ""Ad Nauseam"" sessions. Surreal at times, these included ""Mother"" - featured on ""Derek and Clive Get the Horn"" - where Cook pretends to visit his over-possessive and deranged mother, ending with Cook telling his mother to ""shut your fucking face and die"". ""Valerie's Hymen,"" where Moore discussed cutting out his wife's hymen with a carving knife, and ""Lady Vera Fart Teller"", wherein Moore elaborates on a visit to a fortune teller who could tell his future by examining his farts.  Transcripts of further, unreleased, out takes are available in a book titled ""Come Again"", edited by William Cook and feature ""General Eisenhower"", where Cook reflects on the perils of counting the late General's dandruff flakes; ""Vietnam"", where Moore received a paper cut inflicted by the Viet Cong (in one insightful remark Cook mentions a ""friend"" of his who fought in Vietnam but he's not sure ""on which side""), and ""A Million Pounds"", where Cook plays an hysterical woman trying to obtain a million pounds from a sympathetic Moore. The remaining unreleased out-takes are variations on actual releases.  Tracks from ""Derek and Clive (Live)"", specifically the Bo Duddley sketch, were sampled on one of the first UK house music tracks, 1988's ""Voodoo Ray"" by A Guy Called Gerald. "
wikipedia-1007738," Dangerous Dogs Act 1991  The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 (c. 65) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that was introduced in response to various incidents of serious injury or death resulting from attacks by aggressive and uncontrolled dogs, particularly on children. These incidents received heavy tabloid attention, causing widespread public concern over the keeping of dangerous dogs and a resulting legislative response. The effect of the Act. Under the 1991 Act (and as amended in 1997) it is illegal to own any Specially Controlled Dogs without specific exemption from a court. The dogs have to be muzzled and kept on a lead in public, they must be registered and insured, neutered, tattooed and receive microchip implants. The Act also bans the breeding, sale and exchange of these dogs, even if they are on the Index of Exempted Dogs.  Four types in particular were identified by the Act: The Act also covers cross breeds of the above four types of dog. Dangerous dogs are classified by 'type', not by breed label. This means that whether a dog is prohibited under the Act will depend on a judgement about its physical characteristics, and whether they match the description of a prohibited 'type'. This assessment of the physical characteristics is made by a court.  The Act applies in England, Wales and Scotland, with The Dangerous Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 having a similar effect in Northern Ireland. The Index of Exempted Dogs. The Index of Exempted Dogs is maintained by the Animal Welfare section of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which administers the registration of specially-controlled dogs in England and Wales. In 1991 and 1992 details of all Specially Controlled Dogs and their owners and keepers had to be added to the Index of Exempted Dogs. From early 1992 to 1997 no dogs were allowed to be added to the Index. In 1997 The Dangerous Dogs (Amendment) Act 1997 was passed which made some changes. Case law. There have been several test cases of the Act, most famously Dempsey (a pit bull terrier) who in 1995 was finally reprieved from a destruction order, to widespread media attention. The definition of the word ""type"" in the legislation was of particular controversy, as was the lack of discretion that the Act gives magistrates. Criticism of the Act. The Act has been described as a piece of rushed legislation which was an overreaction to a transient public mood. The Act is sometimes cited as an unfavourable example of such legislation, and in January 2007 was included in public responses to a BBC Radio 4 poll of unpopular UK legislation. Comparable legislation elsewhere. Many other countries also have laws pertaining to dangerous dogs. These vary in severity. In some jurisdictions in Australia dogs which have been declared dangerous are required to wear a collar of red and yellow stripes; under the legislation of some municipalities of Queensland, such dogs are seized and destroyed. In some local government areas restrictions are very carefully spelt out. "
wikipedia-545848," Clifford Odets  Clifford Odets (July 18, 1906 – August 14, 1963) was an American playwright, screenwriter, and director. Early life. Odets was born in Philadelphia to Louis Odets (born Gorodetsky) and Pearl Geisinger, Russian- and Romanian-Jewish immigrants, and raised in Philadelphia and the Bronx, New York. He dropped out of high school after two years to become an actor. In 1931, he became a founding member of the Group Theatre, a highly influential New York theatre company that utilized an acting technique new to the United States. This technique was based on the system devised by the Russian actor and director Constantin Stanislavski. It was further developed by Group Theatre director Lee Strasberg and became known as The Method or Method Acting. Odets eventually became the Group's primary playwright. Career. Theatre. Odets pursued acting with great passion and ingenuity. At the age of 19 he struck out on his own, billing himself as ″The Rover Reciter.″ Under this moniker he procured bookings as a radio elocutionist. He moved away from his parents, to Greenwich Village, where he acted with the Poet's Theatre under the direction of Village legend Harry Kemp. Odets claimed to have become America's first real disc jockey at about this time, at radio station WBNY, as well as a drama critic. In this capacity he saw the 1926 Broadway production of Sean O'Casey's ""Juno and the Paycock."" O'Casey's work would prove to be a powerful influence on Odets.  Following stints as a dramatics counselor at Catskill summer camps and periods of employment in stock companies, in 1929 Odets got his Broadway break. He was cast as understudy to Spencer Tracy in ""Conflict"" by Vincent Lawrence. He landed his first job with the prestigious Theatre Guild in the fall of 1929, as an extra playing bit parts. Odets acted in small roles in a number of Theatre Guild productions between 1929 and 1931. It was at the Theatre Guild that he befriended the casting director, Cheryl Crawford. Crawford suggested that Harold Clurman, then a play reader for the Guild, invite Odets to a meeting to discuss new theatre concepts they were developing with Lee Strasberg. Odets was mesmerized by Clurman's talks, and became the last actor chosen for the Group Theatre's first summer of rehearsals in June, 1931, at Brookfield Center in Connecticut. From the start, Odets was relegated to small roles and understudying other actors. With the extra time on his hands and at Clurman's urging, he began to write plays. He wrote two early plays, an autobiographical piece entitled ""910 Eden Street"", and one about his hero, Beethoven. Clurman dismissed these two plays as juvenilia, but encouraged his friend to continue writing while steering him towards familiar milieus. In late 1932, Odets began writing a play about a middle-class Jewish family in the Bronx, initially called ""I Got the Blues"". He worked diligently on this play, sharing drafts of it with Clurman and promising parts to his fellow actors – often the same parts. While at Green Mansions, their 1933 summer rehearsal venue in Warrensburg, New York, the Group performed Act II of the play, now retitled ""Awake and Sing!"", for other camp residents. The audience was enthusiastic, but the Group's leadership, Lee Strasberg in particular, was still, at this point, opposed to producing it. Odets trained with the Group at their various summer rehearsal headquarters located in the Connecticut countryside and the Catskills. In addition to Brookfield Center and Green Mansions, these venues included Dover Furnace in Dutchess County (1932) and a large house in Ellenville, New York (1934). The Group spent the summer of 1936 at Pine Brook Country Club in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Their final summer retreat was at Lake Grove, in Smithtown, New York, in 1939. Odets's Group training under Strasberg's tutelage was essential to his development as a playwright. He stated in an interview late in life that ″My chief influence as a playwright was the Group Theatre acting company, and being a member of that company. . . . And you can see the Group Theatre acting technique crept right into the plays.″ Odets's first play to be produced was the one-act ""Waiting for Lefty"", on January 5, 1935, at the Civic Repertory Theatre on Fourteenth Street in New York City. The piece is a series of interconnected scenes depicting workers for a fictional taxi company, but inspired by an actual taxi strike. The focus alternates between the drivers' union meeting and vignettes from the workers' difficult and oppressed lives. Not all are taxi drivers. A young medical intern falls victim to anti-Semitism; a laboratory assistant's job is threatened if he doesn't comply with orders to spy on a colleague; couples are thwarted in marriage, and torn apart by the hopelessness of economic conditions caused by the Great Depression. The climax is a defiant call for the union to strike, which brought the entire opening night audience to its feet. The play can be performed in any acting space, including union meeting halls and on the street. ""Waiting for Lefty""'s unexpectedly wild success brought Odets international fame. ""Awake and Sing!"", produced in February 1935, is generally regarded as Odets's masterpiece. It has been cited as ″the earliest quintessential Jewish play outside the Yiddish theatre."" The play concerns the Berger family, living in the Bronx under the shadow of economic collapse. Odets's choice of opening the play in media res, his dialogue style, and the fact that it was the first play on Broadway to focus entirely on a Jewish family, distinguish ""Awake and Sing!"" from other full-length plays of its time.  The 1935 one-acts ""Waiting for Lefty"" and ""Till the Day I Die,"" along with a number of other plays produced by the Group Theatre, are harsh criticisms of profiteers and exploitative economic systems during the Great Depression. These two early plays by Odets have been dismissed by some critics as left-wing propaganda. More commonly, however, ""Waiting for Lefty"" is considered iconic in the agitprop genre, and the piece is widely anthologized. Odets asserted that all of his plays deal with the human spirit persevering in the face of any opponent, whether or not the characters are depicted as struggling with the capitalist system. The highly successful ""Golden Boy"" (1937) portrays a young man torn between artistic and material fulfillment. Ironically, it was the Group Theatre's biggest commercial success. From ""Golden Boy"" on, Odets's work focused more on the dynamics of interpersonal relationships as affected by the moral dilemmas of individual characters. In 1938 the Group presented Odets's ""Rocket to the Moon"", a more reflective piece. Leftist critics rebuked Odets for abandoning his formerly overt political stance. The playwright George S. Kaufman queried, ""Odets, where is thy sting?"" Nonetheless, ""Rocket to the Moon"" garnered enough attention to place Odets on the cover of ""Time"" magazine in December 1938. Odets's last play, ""The Flowering Peach,"" was produced on Broadway in 1954. ""The Flowering Peach"" was the preferred choice of the Pulitzer Prize jury in 1955, but under pressure from Joseph Pulitzer Jr., the prize went instead to ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", which the jury considered the weakest of the five shortlisted nominees. Four of Odets's plays – ""Golden Boy"", ""Clash by Night"", ""The Big Knife"" and ""The Country Girl"" – have been made into films, though Odets did not write the screenplays. Hollywood. The success of Odets's early plays attracted the attention of Hollywood producers. He first went to Hollywood in early 1936 to write for the screen as well as the stage. From this point on he would spend most of his life in Hollywood. His initial intention was to make money to help subsidize the Group Theatre's run of his late-1935 play ""Paradise Lost"" and to help him fulfill his own financial obligations. His first screenplay was produced by Paramount and directed by Lewis Milestone. Starring Gary Cooper and Madeleine Carroll, ""The General Died at Dawn"" (1936) received some positive reviews, though Frank Nugent of the ""New York Times"" reiterated Kaufman's barb in his article's title.  Like most screenwriters of the time, Odets worked within the studio system until the advent of independent production in the 1950s. Thus Odets would often write drafts that were handed off to another screenwriter or team for further development. Odets declined to be credited for many of the films on which he worked. He did, however, accept principal credit as both screenwriter and director for ""None but the Lonely Heart"" (1944), adapted from the novel by Richard Llewellyn, and produced by RKO. The film starred Cary Grant, Ethel Barrymore (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), Barry Fitzgerald, and Jane Wyatt. Odets wrote the 1957 screenplay for ""Sweet Smell of Success"", based on the novelette by Ernest Lehman and produced by the independent company Hill-Hecht-Lancaster. Starring Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis, this film noir depicts the underbelly of the newspaper world. The character of J.J. Hunsecker, played by Lancaster, was voted the 35th most despicable villain in 100 years of film by the American Film Institute. Odets directed one other film, for which he also wrote the screenplay, ""The Story on Page One"" (1959). Style. Odets' dramatic style is distinguished by a kind of poetic, metaphor-laden street talk. Arthur Miller observed that, with Odets' first plays, ″For the very first time in America, language itself . . . marked a playwright as unique.″ Odets' use of ethnic and urban speech patterns reflects the influence of another socialist playwright with proletarian concerns, Sean O'Casey. Other hallmarks of Odets' style are his humanistic point of view, and his way of dropping the audience right into the conflict with little or no introduction. Often character is more important than plot, reflecting the influence of Anton Chekhov. HUAC. In May 1952, Odets was called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA; more commonly, HUAC). He had belonged to the Communist Party for less than a year, between 1934 and 1935 and sponsored many left-wing, progressive groups. He cooperated with the Committee to the extent that he responded to their questions, and reiterated names of Communist Party members who had been previously cited by his friend and former Group colleague, Elia Kazan. Prior to Kazan’s final testimony in April 1952, they agreed to name each other. Odets thereby avoided blacklisting, but reactions to his testimony confused him; he did not consider himself a cooperative witness. A partial transcript of Odets’ testimony can be found in Eric Bentley’s ""Thirty Years of Treason."" Odets was reportedly tormented by public reaction to his testimony until his death in 1963. In his autobiography, Kazan recalls incidents of Odets being accosted in the street and snubbed in Hollywood restaurants after his HUAC appearance. Odets's productivity declined after his 1952 testimony. Later years. In the early 1960s, Odets contracted to write four of a proposed total of thirteen teleplays for NBC's new dramatic anthology, ""The Richard Boone Show"", and to act as script supervisor. Two of Odets's finished scripts were aired posthumously: ""Big Mitch"" (December 10, 1963), and ""The Mafia Man"" (January 7, 1964). Odets also worked on the libretto for a projected musical version of ""Golden Boy"". He died before the project came to fruition. Playwright William Gibson, a former student of Odets, completed the book. Personal life. Odets first married two-time Academy Award winning actress Luise Rainer in January 1937. They divorced in May 1940. He married for a second time in 1943 to actress Bette Grayson. They had two children, Nora, born in 1945, and Walt Whitman, now a clinical psychologist, author and photographer, born in 1947. They divorced 1951.  He also had relationships with actresses Frances Farmer and Fay Wray, among others. Death. On July 23, 1963, Odets was admitted to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles to undergo treatment for stomach ulcers. During surgery, doctors discovered that he had stomach cancer. He received bedside visits from such movie and theater friends as Marlon Brando, Lee Strasberg and Paula Strasberg, Jean Renoir and his wife, Dido, Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, Shirley MacLaine, and Danny Kaye, among others. Renoir dedicated a chapter of his autobiography to his friendship with Odets. On August 14, 1963, Odets died of stomach cancer at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital at the age of 57.  Odets's ashes were interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale in Glendale, California. Legacy. Odets has been looked on by many as an icon of the American theatre. According to Arthur Miller, ″An Odets play was awaited like news hot off the press, as though through him we would know what to think of ourselves and our prospects.″ According to Marian Seldes, ″Paddy Chayefsky, who felt competitive with Odets, . . . told an interviewer, ′There isn't a writer of my generation, especially a New York writer, who doesn't owe his very breath–his entire attitude toward theatre–to Odets.′″ ""Golden Boy"" was made into a 1939 film and became the basis for a 1964 musical of the same name. ""The Flowering Peach"" became the basis for the 1970 Broadway musical ""Two by Two"", which starred  Danny Kaye. Odets's screenplay for ""Sweet Smell of Success"" became the basis for the 2002 musical of the same name. Lincoln Center celebrated the centennial of Odets's birth with their 2006 production of ""Awake and Sing!"", directed by Bartlett Sher. It won that year's Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play and sparked a revival of interest in Odets's work. Another centennial production, ""Rocket to the Moon"", directed by Daniel Fish, was produced by Long Wharf Theater. ""Golden Boy"", also produced by Lincoln Center with Bartlett Sher again directing, opened on December 5, 2012 to enthusiastic reviews, subsequently garnering 8 Tony Award nominations. John Lahr declared, ""In this distinguished, almost symphonic production, Sher and Lincoln Center have done a great thing: they have put Odets finally and forever in the pantheon, where he belongs.""  Odets's early, more left-wing plays, such as ""Waiting for Lefty"", ""Awake and Sing!,"" and ""Paradise Lost,"" have enjoyed numerous revivals since the 2008 economic crash. The Roundabout Theatre Company presented the first revival of Odets's 1949 play, ""The Big Knife"", in the Spring of 2013 at the American Airlines Theatre in New York, with Doug Hughes directing Bobby Cannavale in the lead role of Charlie Castle. The role was originated by Odets's former Group Theatre colleague, John Garfield. The National Asian American Theatre Company (NAATCO) mounted a highly acclaimed production of ""Awake and Sing!"" in September 2013 with an Asian cast. Performed in a small downtown theatre space in New York's Soho area, the limited run played to sold out houses. According to ""New York Times"" Reviewer Anita Gates, ""the production easily makes the point that ethnicity is transcended by the humanity of frightened, imperfect people facing unpleasant realities.""  Joel and Ethan Coen’s film ""Barton Fink"" contains a number of indirect visual and historical references to Odets’s personal appearance, background and career. But, according to the Coen brothers, the film is not meant to be biographical in relation to Odets. A minor character in the 1982 film ""Diner"" speaks only lines from Odets' screenplay for ""Sweet Smell of Success"". The Odets character was played by Jeffrey DeMunn in the film ""Frances"", and by John Heard in the 1983 biography, ""Will There Be A Morning?"", both about Frances Farmer. Odets's name is mentioned in an episode of the NBC series ""Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip"", ""The Wrap Party."" The episode's subplot dealt with The Hollywood Ten. Odets was the subject of a psycho-biography by psychoanalyst Margaret Brenman-Gibson, wife of playwright William Gibson: ""Clifford Odets – American Playwright – The Years from 1906–1940"". It was one component of an umbrella project undertaken by Brenman-Gibson on the subject of creativity. The biography was intended to be a three-volume work, with the second and third volumes to cover the final twenty-three years of Odets's life. Brenman-Gibson died in 2004, leaving the project unfinished. A later-years biography of Odets, covering the years 1941-1963, is currently in progress. Apart from Brenman-Gibson's work, six critical biographies have appeared by the following authors: R. Baird Shuman (1962); Edward Murray (1968); Michael Mendelsohn (1969); Gerald Weales (1971); Harold Cantor (1978); and Christopher J. Herr (2003). "
wikipedia-2003796," Roscoe Lee Browne  Roscoe Lee Browne (May 2, 1925 – April 11, 2007) was an American actor and director, known for his rich voice and dignified bearing. Biography. Browne was the fourth son of a Baptist minister, Sylvanus S. Browne, and his wife Lovie (née Lovie Lee Usher). Born in Woodbury, New Jersey, Browne first attended historically black Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where he became a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1946. He undertook postgraduate work at Middlebury College in Vermont, Columbia University in New York City, and at the University of Florence in Italy. Also an outstanding middle-distance runner, Browne won the Amateur Athletic Union 1,000-yard national indoor championship in 1949. He occasionally returned to Lincoln University between 1946 to 1952 to instruct classes in comparative literature, French, and English. Upon leaving academia he earned a living for several years selling wine for Schenley Import Corporation. Despite his limited amateur acting experience, in 1956 he stunned guests at a party – among them opera singer Leontyne Price – when he announced his intention to quit his secure job with Schenley to become a full-time professional actor. Acting career. Despite the apprehensions of his friends, Browne managed to land the roles of soothsayer and Pindarus in ""Julius Caesar"", directed by Joseph Papp for New York City's first Shakespeare Festival Theater. More work with the Shakespeare Festival Theater followed, and in 1961 he voiced a part as an off-screen camera operator, J. J. Burden, in ""The Connection"" (1961), his first movie role. Despite lacking extensive experience numerous film roles established his reputation as an exceptionally versatile character actor who was also capable of performing scene-stealing cameos. Science fiction fans know Browne as the voice of the evil robot Box in the movie ""Logan's Run"". Endowed with a resonant, baritone voice and able to project cynicism and a haughty, patrician tone cultivated over the years from reciting lines from Shakespeare, Browne was much in demand for narration and voice-over parts in film and on vinyl albums, audio tapes and CDs. During 1968-69 he was heard as a late-night DJ on WNEW-FM in New York reciting poetry, passages from the Bible, and assorted literary works. In 1968, he recorded ""Music and Gibran"", which consisted of English interpretations of Khalil Gibran's poetry, mixed over Middle Eastern background music performed by John Berberian (oud), Souren Baronian (clarinet and baritone saxophone), and Robert Marashlian, among others. Browne was determined not to accept stereotyped and demeaning roles that had routinely been offered to black actors, and he resisted emulating others. Browne also desired to do more than act and narrate, and in 1966 he wrote and made his directorial stage debut with ""A Hand Is On The Gate"" starring Cicely Tyson, James Earl Jones, Moses Gunn, and other rising black talent. A lifelong bachelor who coveted his privacy, in the turbulent decades of the civil rights revolution Browne avoided participation in public protests preferring instead to be “more effective on stage with metaphor...than in the streets with an editorial”. His theatrical work brought him to the attention of producer Leland Hayward, and in 1964 he began a regular stint as a cast member on Hayward's satirical NBC-TV series ""That Was the Week That Was"". Starting in the late 1960s, Browne increasingly became a guest star on TV on both comedy and dramatic shows like ""Mannix"", ""All in the Family"", ""Good Times"", ""Sanford and Son"", ""The Cosby Show"", ""A Different World"", and dozens of other shows. He also was a regular on ""Soap"" where he played Saunders, the erudite butler from 1979–81, replacing Robert Guillaume who went on to his own show ""Benson"". (Browne later guest-starred on ""Benson"" with Guillaume.) His appearances on ""The Cosby Show"", including a memorable episode in which he recited Shakespeare with fellow guest star Christopher Plummer, also drew acclaim as well winning an Emmy Award in 1986 for his guest role as Professor Foster. He and fellow actor Anthony Zerbe toured the United States with their poetry performance piece, ""Behind the Broken Words"", which included readings of poetry, some of it written by Browne, as well as performances of comedy and dramatic works.  Browne's most notable movie role may have been in ""The Cowboys"" where, as a camp cook, he leads a group of young cowhands avenging the death of John Wayne's character in the movie. This 1972 role was particularly notable as one of the earliest portrayals in American cinema of a 19th-century black cowboy as an equal. Browne found additional success performing in August Wilson plays, both on Broadway and the Pittsburgh Public Theater. He was described as having ""a baritone voice like a sable coat,"" speaking the King's English with a strong mid-Atlantic accent. To someone who once said Browne sounded ""too white"", he replied, ""I'm sorry, I once had a white maid."" Four years before his death, Browne narrated a series of WPA slave narratives in the HBO film ""Unchained Memories"" in 2003. Death. Browne died of stomach cancer in Los Angeles on April 11, 2007, aged 81. He was remembered for his contributions in a ""New York Times"" encomium by Frank Crohn, President of The Edna St. Vincent Millay Society:We mourn the loss of our long-time Trustee and faithful friend. He was always to be counted upon to be supportive of the aims and purposes of the Society. He filled our lives with the soft sound of poetry as only he could recite it. Now the stage is empty and the lights are low."" "

wikipedia-3163911," BMO Field  BMO Field is a Canadian soccer stadium located in Exhibition Place in the city of Toronto. The open-air structure can seat up to 21,140 spectators, depending on seating configurations. It is owned by the City of Toronto, and managed by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd. It opened on April 28, 2007 with a 1–0 loss by home side Toronto FC against the Kansas City Wizards.  The stadium hosted the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, at which time it was known as the National Soccer Stadium. It also hosted the MLS Cup 2010 on November 21, 2010. History. BMO Field is the fifth stadium to be built at its exact location at Exhibition Place. The most recent was Exhibition Stadium, former home of the Toronto Argonauts and Toronto Blue Jays, which lost its permanent tenants with the opening of SkyDome (Rogers Centre since 2005) in 1989. Exhibition Stadium was demolished in 1999.  The stadium was part of Canada's successful bid to host the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. The original plan was for the site to be located at York University, with the university contributing $15 million toward the cost of the new stadium. However, the university was forced to back out in May 2005. The eventual site was moved to the location of demolished Exhibition Stadium and then-existing Sports Hall of Fame building. On May 11, 2006, Major League Soccer announced that Toronto FC would join the league as its thirteenth (and first Canada-based) team in 2007. The league considers soccer-specific stadiums to be a critical part of its strategy; MLS commissioner Don Garber has been adamant that expansion teams must have plans for a soccer-specific stadium in place to be granted a franchise. These facilities are thought to improve overall crowd atmosphere (because they are smaller than stadiums built primarily for NFL football or CFL football), and may allow teams to control most revenues generated by their facilities. On August 31, 2006, the ""Toronto Star"" reported that BMO Financial Group purchased the naming rights to the stadium, known then as the National Soccer Stadium. BMO is the stock ticker symbol of the Bank of Montreal, whose operational headquarters are in Toronto, despite its Montreal name (though the bank still has its legal corporate headquarters in the namesake city). The symbol is often pronounced ""BEE-moe"", as are references to the bank itself. On September 20, 2006, stadium webcam viewers watched as a banner was raised on the West Grandstand renaming the stadium ""BMO Field"". The name was later announced on the team's official website. It was referred to under the National Soccer Stadium name in official references to the FIFA U-20 World Cup, as non-FIFA-supporting sponsors were not permitted references. BMO Field has become a home venue for Canada's national Rugby Union team. The team has played two matches at the venue to date, including one against the United States in 2011 and another against Italy in 2012. Canada's has three home games planned in 2013: Ireland for a mid-June test, the USA for an August Rugby World Cup qualifying match and the New Zealand Maori for a Fall test match. Since its opening. The grand opening celebration took place on May 12, 2007.  The only music concert thus far at BMO Field was performed by progressive rock group Genesis on September 7, 2007. The 2008 MLS All Star game was held at BMO Field on July 24, 2008 versus West Ham United F.C. of the English Premier League. In 2009, the Toronto Nationals of Major League Lacrosse began playing their home games at BMO Field. The team moved over to Lamport Stadium for 2010 and have since moved to Hamilton in 2011. On July 18, 2009, BMO Field had its first alcohol suspension, due to an incident that occurred on May 21, 2008, regarding alcohol consumption by a minor. In November 2009, it became public that the owners of the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League were in discussions with the City of Toronto over the possibility of moving from the Rogers Centre to BMO Field, potentially as early as the 2010 CFL season. The CFL agreed to study the feasibility of the Argos playing at BMO Field, which was built too short to fit a full length CFL field. According the MLSE chief operating officer Tom Anselmi, without significant renovations BMO Field could only fit a 100-yard field with 15-yard endzones or a 110-yard field with 10-yard endzones, which is 20-yards short of the standard 110-yard field and 20-yard endzones. On December 16, 2009, the Argonauts officially abandoned the idea following receipt of the CFL study, which stated that ""Canadian football could not be played there in its current state."" As of 2010, Toronto FC are contemplating the possibility of expanding the facility. BMO Field could accommodate an additional 8000 spectators without making fundamental changes to the existing facility, increasing the ground's total capacity upwards of 30,000. The BMO Field became the first venue outside of the United States to host the MLS Cup in 2010 featuring the Colorado Rapids defeating FC Dallas 2–1. Historic goals. The first goal at BMO Field was scored by Eddie Johnson for Kansas City Wizards in a 1–0 Major League Soccer win over home side Toronto FC in the stadium opener on April 28, 2007. The first ever Toronto FC goal at the stadium was Danny Dichio's first-half strike against Chicago Fire on May 12, 2007 (also his club's first ever MLS goal). The first goal at BMO Field scored by a Canadian came at the official opening on May 11, 2007, in a U-20 friendly between Canada and Argentina. David Edgar scored a penalty in a 2–1 defeat for Canada, just four minutes after Alejandro Gomez had scored the first ever international goal at the stadium.  Costa Rica's Víctor Núñez scored the first ever senior international goal in a 1–1 friendly draw with hosts Canada on September 12, 2007, shortly before Dwayne De Rosario scored Canada's first senior goal at the stadium. The first Toronto FC goal scored by a Canadian at BMO Field was in a June 25, 2007 friendly against Aston Villa of the English Premier League. Andrea Lombardo scored an equalizer at BMO Field's south end to make it 2–2 before Aston Villa ran out 4–2 winners. The first league goal at BMO Field scored by a Canadian came when Miguel Cañizalez scored for Toronto FC in the second minute of their 2–1 defeat to Columbus Crew on September 22, 2007, snapping an 824-minute MLS goalless streak. On May 19, 2007, Bolivian forward Jaime Moreno scored his 108th MLS goal on a penalty kick for D.C. United in their 2–1 win over Toronto FC at BMO Field, tying him for the all-time league lead with Jason Kreis. Moreno has since taken sole ownership of the record. In lacrosse, the first MLL goal at BMO Field was scored by Merrick Thomson of the Toronto Nationals in a 15-11 win in their home opener on May 22, 2009. Management, ownership and funding. With a total costs of $62.9 million (all figures are in Canadian dollars) to build the stadium ($72.8 million including the land), financial contributions came from multiple sources. The Canadian Federal Government contributed $27 million, the Government of Ontario's added an additional $8 million, and the City of Toronto paid $9.8 million and contributed the land for the project (valued at $10 million), while retaining ownership of the stadium. Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), owners of the National Hockey League's Toronto Maple Leafs and the National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors, contributed $8 million towards construction costs and was responsible for any cost overruns. In return, they got the management rights for the stadium. MLSE committed to purchase a MLS soccer team to play in the stadium. The remaining funds came from MLSE, which paid $10 million for the naming rights of the stadium for the duration of the 20 year management agreement, which they later resold to the Bank of Montreal for $27 million over the first 10 years. In 2010, MLSE spent $3.5 million to convert the stadium from Field Turf to natural grass. As of 2013, MLSE is considering a $100 million renovation of the stadium which would include adding a roof and possibly making the the stadium CFL compatible as a home for the Argonauts. 2015 Pan American Games. During the 2015 Pan American Games, BMO Field is scheduled to host rugby sevens competition. Due to sponsorship rules with the Pan American Sports Organization, the facility will be known as the ""National Soccer Stadium"" (this despite the fact that no soccer is, at least under current plans as of 2012, slated to be played at the stadium; soccer is instead slated for the New Hamilton Stadium). Stadium specifics. BMO Field originally used FieldTurf rather than a natural grass pitch, which had attracted some criticism. However in 2009, Toronto City Council voted to approve installation of a permanent, natural grass surface beginning in 2010, after MLSE promised to cover all costs of installing and maintaining the surface. Previously, a temporary grass turf was laid in August 2009 for an international friendly against Real Madrid, which was later donated to a local public school stadium. The seats are entirely red with the exception of a design on each of the main stands. On the east side, the design is a large maple leaf while on the lower west stand the design spells out ""TORONTO"", and has a portion of the Toronto FC logo. The south stand has ""BMO"" spelled out. Field of play dimensions are wide × long, meeting FIFA standards. A variety of Kentucky Bluegrass was installed in the spring of 2010, along with a state of the art drainage system and heating system in the field. The first game on natural grass was Toronto FC's home debut on April 15, 2010 versus the expansion Philadelphia Union. Attendance records. The largest attendance overall at the stadium was on April 13, 2011 for a regular season MLS game when Toronto FC hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy in front of 22,453 fans. That number was repeated on June 2, 2013 when Canada's women's national soccer team lost to the United States 3-0 in an international friendly. "
wikipedia-10933," Functional programming  In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. Functional programming emphasizes functions that produce results that depend only on their inputs and not on the program state - i.e. pure mathematical functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function ""f"" twice with the same value for an argument ""x"" will produce the same result ""f(x)"" both times. Eliminating side effects, i.e. changes in state that don't depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.  Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate computability, the Entscheidungsproblem, function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus, where computation is treated as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. In the other well known declarative programming paradigm, logic programming, relations are at the base of respective languages.  In contrast, imperative programming changes state with commands in the source language, the most simple example is the assignment. Functions do exist, not in the mathematical sense, but the sense of subroutine. They can have side effects that may change the value of program state. Functions without return value therefore make sense. Because of this, they lack referential transparency, i.e. the same language expression can result in different values at different times depending on the state of the executing program.  Functional programming languages, especially purely functional ones such as Hope, have largely been emphasized in academia rather than in commercial software development. However, prominent functional programming languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Racket, Erlang, OCaml, Haskell, Scala and F# have been used in industrial and commercial applications by a wide variety of organizations. Functional programming is also supported in some domain-specific programming languages like R (statistics), Mathematica (symbolic and numeric math), J, K and Q from Kx Systems (financial analysis), XQuery/XSLT (XML), and Opal. Widespread domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, especially in eschewing mutable values. Programming in a functional style can also be accomplished in languages that aren't specifically designed for functional programming. For example, the imperative Perl programming language has been the subject of a book describing how to apply functional programming concepts. C# 3.0 added constructs to facilitate the functional style. History. Lambda calculus provides a theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluation. Although it is a mathematical abstraction rather than a programming language, it forms the basis of almost all functional programming languages today. An equivalent theoretical formulation, combinatory logic, is commonly perceived as more abstract than lambda calculus and preceded it in invention. Combinatory logic and lambda calculus were both originally developed to achieve a clearer approach to the foundations of mathematics. An early functional-flavored language was Lisp, developed by John McCarthy while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the IBM 700/7000 series scientific computers in the late 1950s. Lisp introduced many features now found in functional languages, though Lisp is technically a multi-paradigm language. Scheme and Dylan were later attempts to simplify and improve Lisp. Information Processing Language (IPL) is sometimes cited as the first computer-based functional programming language. It is an assembly-style language for manipulating lists of symbols. It does have a notion of ""generator"", which amounts to a function accepting a function as an argument, and, since it is an assembly-level language, code can be used as data, so IPL can be regarded as having higher-order functions. However, it relies heavily on mutating list structure and similar imperative features. Kenneth E. Iverson developed APL in the early 1960s, described in his 1962 book ""A Programming Language"" (ISBN 9780471430148). APL was the primary influence on John Backus's FP. In the early 1990s, Iverson and Roger Hui created J. In the mid-1990s, Arthur Whitney, who had previously worked with Iverson, created K, which is used commercially in financial industries along with its descendant Q. John Backus presented FP in his 1977 Turing Award lecture ""Can Programming Be Liberated From the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and its Algebra of Programs"". He defines functional programs as being built up in a hierarchical way by means of ""combining forms"" that allow an ""algebra of programs""; in modern language, this means that functional programs follow the principle of compositionality. Backus's paper popularized research into functional programming, though it emphasized function-level programming rather than the lambda-calculus style which has come to be associated with functional programming. In the 1970s, ML was created by Robin Milner at the University of Edinburgh, and David Turner developed initially the language SASL at the University of St. Andrews and later the language Miranda at the University of Kent. ML eventually developed into several dialects, the most common of which are now OCaml and Standard ML. Also in the 1970s, the development of Scheme (a partly functional dialect of Lisp), as described in the influential Lambda Papers and the 1985 textbook ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"", brought awareness of the power of functional programming to the wider programming-languages community. In the 1980s, Per Martin-Löf developed intuitionistic type theory (also called ""constructive"" type theory), which associated functional programs with constructive proofs of arbitrarily complex mathematical propositions expressed as dependent types. This led to powerful new approaches to interactive theorem proving and has influenced the development of many subsequent functional programming languages. The Haskell language began with a consensus in 1987 to form an open standard for functional programming research; implementation releases have been ongoing since 1990. Concepts. A number of concepts and paradigms are specific to functional programming, and generally foreign to imperative programming (including object-oriented programming). However, programming languages are often hybrids of several programming paradigms, so programmers using ""mostly imperative"" languages may have utilized some of these concepts. First-class and higher-order functions. Higher-order functions are functions that can either take other functions as arguments or return them as results. In calculus, an example of a higher-order function is the differential operator formula_1, which returns the derivative of a function formula_2. Higher-order functions are closely related to first-class functions in that higher-order functions and first-class functions both allow functions as arguments and results of other functions. The distinction between the two is subtle: ""higher-order"" describes a mathematical concept of functions that operate on other functions, while ""first-class"" is a computer science term that describes programming language entities that have no restriction on their use (thus first-class functions can appear anywhere in the program that other first-class entities like numbers can, including as arguments to other functions and as their return values). Higher-order functions enable partial application or currying, a technique in which a function is applied to its arguments one at a time, with each application returning a new function that accepts the next argument. This allows one to succinctly express, for example, the successor function as the addition operator partially applied to the natural number one. Pure functions. Purely functional functions (or expressions) have no side effects (memory or I/O). This means that pure functions have several useful properties, many of which can be used to optimize the code: While most compilers for imperative programming languages detect pure functions and perform common-subexpression elimination for pure function calls, they cannot always do this for pre-compiled libraries, which generally do not expose this information, thus preventing optimizations that involve those external functions. Some compilers, such as gcc, add extra keywords for a programmer to explicitly mark external functions as pure, to enable such optimizations. Fortran 95 also allows functions to be designated ""pure"". Recursion. Iteration (looping) in functional languages is usually accomplished via recursion. Recursive functions invoke themselves, allowing an operation to be performed over and over until the base case is reached. Though some recursion requires maintaining a stack, tail recursion can be recognized and optimized by a compiler into the same code used to implement iteration in imperative languages. The Scheme language standard requires implementations to recognize and optimize tail recursion. Tail recursion optimization can be implemented by transforming the program into continuation passing style during compiling, among other approaches. Common patterns of recursion can be factored out using higher order functions, with catamorphisms and anamorphisms (or ""folds"" and ""unfolds"") being the most obvious examples. Such higher order functions play a role analogous to built-in control structures such as loops in imperative languages. Most general purpose functional programming languages allow unrestricted recursion and are Turing complete, which makes the halting problem undecidable, can cause unsoundness of equational reasoning, and generally requires the introduction of inconsistency into the logic expressed by the language's type system. Some special purpose languages such as Coq allow only well-founded recursion and are strongly normalizing (nonterminating computations can be expressed only with infinite streams of values called codata). As a consequence, these languages fail to be Turing complete and expressing certain functions in them is impossible, but they can still express a wide class of interesting computations while avoiding the problems introduced by unrestricted recursion. Functional programming limited to well-founded recursion with a few other constraints is called total functional programming. See Turner 2004 for more discussion. Strict versus non-strict evaluation. Functional languages can be categorized by whether they use ""strict (eager)"" or ""non-strict (lazy)"" evaluation, concepts that refer to how function arguments are processed when an expression is being evaluated. The technical difference is in the denotational semantics of expressions containing failing or divergent computations. Under strict evaluation, the evaluation of any term containing a failing subterm will itself fail. For example, the expression: will fail under strict evaluation because of the division by zero in the third element of the list. Under nonstrict evaluation, the length function will return the value 4 (i.e., the number of items in the list), since evaluating it will not attempt to evaluate the terms making up the list. In brief, strict evaluation always fully evaluates function arguments before invoking the function. Non-strict evaluation does not evaluate function arguments unless their values are required to evaluate the function call itself. The usual implementation strategy for non-strict evaluation in functional languages is graph reduction. Non-strict evaluation is used by default in several pure functional languages, including Miranda, Clean, and Haskell. Type systems. Especially since the development of Hindley–Milner type inference in the 1970s, functional programming languages have tended to use typed lambda calculus, as opposed to the untyped lambda calculus used in Lisp and its variants (such as Scheme). The use of algebraic datatypes and pattern matching makes manipulation of complex data structures convenient and expressive; the presence of strong compile-time type checking makes programs more reliable, while type inference frees the programmer from the need to manually declare types to the compiler. Some research-oriented functional languages such as Coq, Agda, Cayenne, and Epigram are based on intuitionistic type theory, which allows types to depend on terms. Such types are called dependent types. These type systems do not have decidable type inference and are difficult to understand and program with. But dependent types can express arbitrary propositions in predicate logic. Through the Curry–Howard isomorphism, then, well-typed programs in these languages become a means of writing formal mathematical proofs from which a compiler can generate certified code. While these languages are mainly of interest in academic research (including in formalized mathematics), they have begun to be used in engineering as well. Compcert is a compiler for a subset of the C programming language that is written in Coq and formally verified. A limited form of dependent types called generalized algebraic data types (GADT's) can be implemented in a way that provides some of the benefits of dependently typed programming while avoiding most of its inconvenience. GADT's are available in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, in OCaml (since version 4.00) and in Scala (as ""case classes""), and have been proposed as additions to other languages including Java and C#. Functional programming in non-functional languages. It is possible to use a functional style of programming in languages that are not traditionally considered functional languages. For example, both D and Fortran 95 explicitly support pure functions. First class functions have slowly been added to mainstream languages. For example, in early 1994, support for lambda, filter, map, and reduce was added to Python. Then during the development of Python 3000, Guido van Rossum called for the removal of these features. However, he later changed his mind, and only reduce was removed, though it remains accessible via the codice_1 standard library module. First class functions were also introduced in PHP 5.3, Visual Basic 9, C# 3.0, and C++11. In Java, anonymous classes can sometimes be used to simulate closures; however, anonymous classes are not always proper replacements to closures because they have more limited capabilities. Java 8, scheduled for release in 2014, will support lambda expressions as a replacement for some anonymous classes. However, the presence of checked exceptions in Java can make functional programming inconvenient, because it can be necessary to catch checked exceptions and then rethrow them - a problem that does not occur in other JVM languages that do not have checked exceptions, such as Scala. Many object-oriented design patterns are expressible in functional programming terms: for example, the strategy pattern simply dictates use of a higher-order function, and the visitor pattern roughly corresponds to a catamorphism, or fold. Similarly, the idea of immutable data from functional programming is often included in imperative programming languages, for example the tuple in Python, which is an immutable array. Comparison to imperative programming. Functional programming is very different from imperative programming. The most significant differences stem from the fact that functional programming avoids side effects, which are used in imperative programming to implement state and I/O. Pure functional programming completely prevents side-effects and provides referential transparency, which makes it easier to verify, optimize, and parallelize programs, and easier to write automated tools to perform those tasks. Higher-order functions are rarely used in older imperative programming. Where a traditional imperative program might use a loop to traverse a list, a functional program would use a different technique. It would use a higher-order function that takes as arguments a function and a list. The higher-order function would then apply the given function to each element of the given list and then return a new list with the results. Simulating state. There are tasks (for example, maintaining a bank account balance) that often seem most naturally implemented with state. Pure functional programming performs these tasks, and I/O tasks such as accepting user input and printing to the screen, in a different way. The pure functional programming language Haskell implements them using monads, derived from category theory. Monads offer a way to abstract certain types of computational patterns, including (but not limited to) modeling of computations with mutable state (and other side effects such as I/O) in an imperative manner without losing purity. While existing monads may be easy to apply in a program, given appropriate templates and examples, many students find them difficult to understand conceptually, e.g., when asked to define new monads (which is sometimes needed for certain types of libraries). Another way in which functional languages can simulate state is by passing around a data structure that represents the current state as a parameter to function calls. On each function call, a copy of this data structure is created with whatever differences are the result of the function. This is referred to as 'state-passing style'. Impure functional languages usually include a more direct method of managing mutable state. Clojure, for example, uses managed references that can be updated by applying pure functions to the current state. This kind of approach enables mutability while still promoting the use of pure functions as the preferred way to express computations. Alternative methods such as Hoare logic and uniqueness have been developed to track side effects in programs. Some modern research languages use effect systems to make explicit the presence of side effects. Efficiency issues. Functional programming languages are typically less efficient in their use of CPU and memory than imperative languages such as C and Pascal. This is related to the fact that some mutable data structures like arrays have a very straightforward implementation using present hardware (which is a highly evolved Turing machine). Flat arrays may be accessed very efficiently with deeply pipelined CPUs, prefetched efficiently through caches (with no complex pointer-chasing), or handled with SIMD instructions. And it is not easy to create their equally efficient general-purpose immutable counterparts. For purely functional languages, the worst-case slowdown is logarithmic in the number of memory cells used, because mutable memory can be represented by a purely functional data structure with logarithmic access time (such as a balanced tree). However, such slowdowns are not universal. For programs that perform intensive numerical computations, functional languages such as OCaml and Clean are only slightly slower than C. For programs that handle large matrices and multidimensional databases, array functional languages (such as J and K) were designed with speed optimization. Immutability of data can in many cases lead to execution efficiency by allowing the compiler to make assumptions that are unsafe in an imperative language, thus increasing opportunities for inline expansion. Lazy evaluation may also speed up the program, even asymptotically, whereas it may slow it down at most by a constant factor (however, it may introduce memory leaks if used improperly). Launchbury 1993 discusses theoretical issues related to memory leaks from lazy evaluation, and O'Sullivan ""et al."" 2008 give some practical advice for analyzing and fixing them. However, the most general implementations of lazy evaluation making extensive use of dereferenced code and data perform poorly on modern processors with deep pipelines and multi-level caches (where a cache miss may cost hundreds of cycles) Coding styles. Imperative programs tend to emphasize the series of steps taken by a program in carrying out an action, while functional programs tend to emphasize the composition and arrangement of functions, often without specifying explicit ""steps"". A simple example illustrates this with two solutions to the same programming goal (calculating Fibonacci numbers). The imperative example is in Python. Haskell. A functional version (in Haskell) has a different feel to it: Or, more concisely: The imperative style describes the intermediate steps involved in calculating codice_2, and places those steps inside a loop statement. In contrast, the functional implementation shown here states the mathematical recurrence relation that defines the entire Fibonacci sequence, then selects an element from the sequence (see also recursion). This example relies on Haskell's lazy evaluation to create an ""infinite"" list of which only as much as needed (the first 10 elements in this case) will actually be computed. That computation happens when the runtime system carries out the action described by ""main"". Erlang. The same program in Erlang provides a simple example of how functional languages in general do not require their syntax to contain an ""if"" statement. This program is contained within a module called ""fibonacci"" and declares that the start/1 function will be visible from outside the scope of this module. The function start/1 accepts a single parameter (as denoted by the ""/1"" syntax) and then calls an internal function called do_fib/3. In direct contrast to the imperative coding style, Erlang does not need an ""if"" statement because the Erlang runtime will examine the parameters being passed to a function, and call the first function having a signature that matches the current pattern of parameters. (Erlang syntax does provide an ""if"" statement, but it is considered syntactic sugar and, compared to its usage in imperative languages, plays only a minor role in application logic design). In this case, it is unnecessary to test for a parameter value within the body of the function because such a test is implicitly performed by providing a set of function signatures that describe the different patterns of values that could be received by a function. In the case above, the first version of do_fib/3 will only be called when the third parameter has the precise value of 1. In all other cases, the second version of do_fib/3 will be called. This example demonstrates that functional programming languages often implement conditional logic ""implicitly"" by matching parameter patterns rather than ""explicitly"" by means of an ""if"" statement. Lisp. The Fibonacci function can be written in Common Lisp as follows: The program can then be called as Use in industry. Functional programming has long been popular in academia, but with few industrial applications. However, recently several prominent functional programming languages have been used in commercial or industrial systems. For example, the Erlang programming language, which was developed by the Swedish company Ericsson in the late 1980s, was originally used to implement fault-tolerant telecommunications systems. It has since become popular for building a range of applications at companies such as T-Mobile, Nortel, Facebook, Électricité de France and WhatsApp. The Scheme dialect of Lisp was used as the basis for several applications on early Apple Macintosh computers, and has more recently been applied to problems such as training simulation software and telescope control. OCaml, which was introduced in the mid-1990s, has seen commercial use in areas such as financial analysis, driver verification, industrial robot programming, and static analysis of embedded software. Haskell, although initially intended as a research language, has also been applied by a range of companies, in areas such as aerospace systems, hardware design, and web programming. Other functional programming languages that have seen use in industry include Scala (which is a hybrid functional-OO language and has support for both purely functional and imperative programming), F#, Lisp, Standard ML, and Clojure.

wikipedia-3651147," The Rebel Sell  ""The Rebel Sell: Why the culture can't be jammed"" (U.S. release: ""Nation of Rebels: Why Counterculture Became Consumer Culture"") is a non-fiction book written by Canadian authors Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter in 2004. The central claim of the book is that counter-cultural movements have failed, and that they all share a common fatal error in the way they understand society; thus counter-culture is not a threat to ""the system"". Conformity. Following their claim that conformity isn't something perpetuated by mainstream media, Potter and Heath identify other sources of conformity using work from Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Sigmund Freud. They describe conformity as often the byproduct of simple market preferences or, alternatively, as an attempt to resolve a collective action problem. For instance, they claim that school uniforms curb the fashion 'arms race' created between students when no restrictions are in place, and that they are not intended merely to stamp out individualism, as many counter-cultural figures have suggested. According to Potter and Heath, this is why counter-culture is met with resistance: not because the mainstream is brainwashed into loving social customs, but because social customs provide a safety net saving us from a constant need to recalculate the significance of our surroundings. For example, thanks to rules of traffic, a pedestrian can generally safely stand on a sidewalk, without needing to reevaluate at each instance whether an oncoming bus might stay within its lane or whether it might hit the pedestrian. Thus, rules are by no means inherently oppressive: the undesirability of many facets of society (such as consumerism) are, if anything, caused from the 'bottom up'. To Potter and Heath, then, some rules may be beneficial, and some rules may be useful.  In the case of consumerism, the book explains that the phenomenon comes largely from competitive consumption in an effort for distinction, and 'rebellion' is an excellent path to distinction. Since most goods depend on exclusivity for their value, especially goods which are said to decry mainstream life, a purchasing 'arms race' is created whenever others begin to follow the same tendencies: if you lag, you become mainstream. Not surprisingly, then, the image of rebelliousness or non-conformity has long been a selling point for many products, especially those that begin as 'alternative' products. Far from being 'subversive,' encouraging the purchase of such products (such as ""Adbusters""' line of running shoes) does nothing more than turn them into 'mainstream' ones. This tendency is very easy to observe in music, for example. Collective action problems. Critically, explain Heath and Potter, most of society's problems (and rules) are traceable to collective action problems, not traits inherent in cultures as most culture jammers believe, a mistake which leads them to attempt to disrupt the existing social order with very few results. It also allows people to wrongly claim a political element to their lifestyle preferences, or glorify criminality as a form of dissent. The book claims there are a few solutions to these collective action problems. ""The Rebel Sell"" recommends a simple legislative solution to problems such as consumerism, for example, through eliminating tax deductions for advertising. (The notion that top-down solutions are far more effective than the ""think globally act locally"" grassroots movement of the 1960s is a running theme). The authors also point, however, to the counterculture's tendency to reject institutional solutions, a mistake which merely invites the problem to remain. Criticism. In his review of the book, Derrick O'Keefe claims the book does not argue for ""a more coherent and effective Left politics,"" but for a ""strident defense of markets and capitalism."" He accuses the authors of using strawman arguments, and misrepresenting some of the people they criticize (in particular, he accuses them of oversimplifying Naomi Klein's ""No Logo"" and misrepresenting Antonio Gramsci's concept of cultural hegemony). O'Keefe also accuses the book of being racist, as it claims that Detroit's black population's participation in the 12th Street riot was the cause of the neighborhood's problems while omitting the many root causes of the riots entirely. He also cites the book's ""lumping political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal in with the likes of Lorena Bobbitt and the Columbine shooters."" O'Keefe claims that the authors' defense of white rapper Eminem (while criticizing contemporary black hip-hop) shows their ignorance of the subject and ignores politically conscious black hip-hop artists. A review of the book in ""The Guardian"" claims ""the argument it makes is important and original"" but says that ""in places it is also unfair, light on evidence and repetitively polemical."" It also claims the book ""relies too heavily on setting up straw men,"" and finds that while the authors are pro-welfare and anti-unfettered business, their ""dislike of the capitalist fixation with youth culture... comes close to a fogeyish distaste for youth culture itself"" and they ""can sound as nostalgic as any conservative newspaper columnist for the world before the 60s."" Additionally, the review claims that the authors focus too much on North America, ignoring the ""more paternalistic and less fashion-fixated"" capitalism and non-commodified dissent in other parts of the world. A review of the book from ""The Onion AV Club"" claims that the ""prose... betrays a deep social conservatism,"" and that the authors ""frustratingly treat the concepts of gradual reform and a total revolution in human consciousness as an either/or proposition."" It also claims that the good ideas of the book were ""borrowed wholesale from Frank and from ""Bobos in Paradise"" author David Brooks,"" but the book fails to have equal quality due to ""the unsavory combo of faulty reasoning and weak arguments."" Response. In later interviews, lectures, and in an epilogue added to later editions of the book, the authors responded to their critics. They give their personal and political biographies to establish their left-wing credentials, of which some reviewers, such as the ""The AV Club"" were apparently unaware. They also acknowledge flaws in the explanation of some of their arguments. However they also criticize their reviewers for confusing their attack on the ideals of counterculture as an attack on art or the Left in general. "

wikipedia-4123257," NBC suit  An NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) suit is a type of military personal protective equipment designed to provide protection against direct contact with and contamination by radioactive, biological or chemical substances, and provides protection from contamination with radioactive materials and some types of radiation, depending on the design. It is generally designed to be worn for extended periods to allow the wearer to fight (or generally function) while under threat of or under actual nuclear, biological, or chemical attack. The civilian equivalent is the Hazmat suit. The term NBC has been replaced by CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear), with the addition of a new threat, radiological, meaning radiological weapon. Sometimes they are called chemsuits or chem suits or chemical suits. Reality. NBC stands for nuclear, biological, chemical. It is a term used in the armed forces and in health and safety, mostly in the context of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) clean-up in overseas conflict or protection of emergency services during the response to a terrorist attack, though there are civilian and common-use applications (such as recovery and clean up efforts after industrial accidents). In military operations, NBC suits are intended to be quickly donned over a soldier’s uniform and can continuously protect the user for up to several days. Most are made of impermeable material such as rubber, but some incorporate a filter, allowing air, sweat and condensation to slowly pass through. An example of this is the Canadian military NBC suit. The older Soviet suit was impermeable rubber-coated canvas. Now known as the CBRN suit, the British Armed Forces suit is reinforced nylon with charcoal impregnated felt. It is more comfortable because of the breathability but has a shorter useful life, and must be replaced often. The British Armed Forces suit is known as a ""Noddy suit"" because some of them had a pointed hood like the hat worn by the fictional character Noddy. The Soviet style suit will protect the wearer at higher concentrations than the British suit but is less comfortable due to the build-up of moisture within it. A Soviet suit was known as a Womble because of its long faced respirator with round visor glasses. In Canadian terminology, an NBC suit or any kind of similar protective over-suit is also known as a Bunnysuit. Fiction. A contemporary fictional example is shown by the Hazardous Environment Suit as worn by Gordon Freeman in the ""Half-Life"" series of video games. In this context, Freeman's HEV suit is used as an explanation for his resistance to environmental hazards and physical damage, the suit also having some of the properties of power armor. The protagonist of Half-Life: Opposing Force, USMC Corporal Adrian Shephard, wears a military version of the HEV suit called the Powered Combat Vest (PCV). In the games ""Fallout 3"" and """", radiation suits are commonly used due to the radiation in the game. They are either yellow or white with a clear or red plastic visors. They block out some radiation found in the worlds. In the ""New Vegas"" add-on , creatures known as Ghost People are in fact former humans trapped in their chemical protection suits.

In the game ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R."", many of the NPCs are seen wearing protective Environmental and Exoskeleton suits. In the game ""Killing Floor"" one of the default characters is wearing a British NBC suit in conjunction with a vest and British military helmet. Blackwatch Troopers in the game ""Prototype"" wear stylized NBC suits. This, according to the game designers, was a design decision in order to dehumanize them in the eyes of the player. In the novel ""Metro 2033"" by Dmitry Glukhovsky people visiting the irradiated surface of Moscow wear black radiation suits with unique clear faced gas masks. However in the video game of the same name no suit is needed only a gas mask. In the future war in the fiction series ""Rogue Trooper"" both sides wear NBC suits and call them chemsuits; this word is used sometimes also in the real world. "

wikipedia-20412851," Only Connect  Only Connect is a quiz show programme first shown on BBC Four on 15 September 2008, presented by Victoria Coren Mitchell. In the series, teams compete in a tournament of finding connections between seemingly unrelated clues. ""Radio Times""s listings usually describe it as ""a game of patience and lateral thinking"". The phrase ""Only connect"" was originally used as the epigraph to E. M. Forster's 1910 novel ""Howards End"". Format. Each programme has two teams of three people competing in four rounds of gameplay. In the first three series, clues in Rounds 1 and 2 and the connecting walls in Round 3 were identified by Greek letters. In series 4 Coren announced that this idea had been dropped, ostensibly due to viewer complaints that it was too pretentious, and that henceforth Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs (two reeds, lion, twisted flax, horned viper, water and the eye of Horus) would be used instead. The show's opening sequence continued to display Greek letters until series 5, when they were replaced with the hieroglyphs. In series 7 the ""knockout"" format was modified to let losing teams compete for second chance places, in a rule change that Coren Mitchell said that even she did not fully understand. Round 1: Connections. Teams are given up to four clues and must try to figure out the connection between them within 40 seconds. The team is initially shown one clue, and may request the remaining three clues at any time within the 40 seconds (they are not automatically shown). The team may press their buzzer to guess after the first clue for 5 points, the second for 3, the third for 2, or the fourth for 1. If the team guesses incorrectly, or fails to buzz within the time allotted, the question is thrown over to the other team for a bonus point, after being shown any remaining clues. Typically, one of the six puzzles involves pictures, and another uses pieces of music, both classical and contemporary. For example, sequential clues of ""A hammer and feather"", ""Six US flags"", ""Eugene Shoemaker's ashes"" and ""Two golf balls"" would require the answer ""Items left on the Moon"" (or a variant thereof). Round 2: Sequences. Each set of clues is now a sequence, and teams must try to figure out the fourth item in the sequence (therefore, the team will only be able to see three clues), again as early as possible. They must give the final item in the sequence, and score points even if their theory for the connection is incorrect. As in the previous round, each team will play three sets; again, if one team fails to guess, it is thrown over to the other team, who can see any remaining clues and earn one point by guessing correctly. As in Round 1, one of the sets of clues involves pictures. For example, sequential clues of ""5 C in an N"", ""2 N in a D"" and ""2 1/2 D in a Q"" would be answered correctly with ""4 Q in a D"" (the explanation being abbreviations of US coin values, five cents in one nickel, etc.) Round 3: Connecting Wall. Each team receives a wall of 16 clues and must figure out a perfect solution, consisting of four groups of four connected items. The puzzles are designed to suggest more connections than actually exist, and some clues appear to fit into more than one category. Teams score 1 point for each group found within 2 minutes 30 seconds. They try to create one group at a time, and may make unlimited guesses on the first two groups. Once two groups have been identified, they only have three chances to identify the remaining two groups.  Should the team fail to complete the wall, the missing groupings are shown. Teams can then earn 1 point per group for identifying the connection, regardless of whether they correctly identified the grouping. A team that identifies all four groups and all four connections earns a 2-point bonus, for a total of 10 points. Unlike the previous two rounds, teams have no opportunity to score on their opponents' wall.  On 1 March 2010, an interactive online version of this round was put on the Only Connect website. In the summer of 2011, coinciding with Series 5, the website took online submissions for new Connecting Walls, although a successful submission does not guarantee publication on the site. Round 4: Missing Vowels. In a final buzzer round, the teams are presented with a series of word puzzles. The category of the puzzles is given prior to them being displayed, and each category contains a maximum of four puzzles. Each puzzle is a word or phrase with the vowels removed and the spaces shifted to disguise the original words. For example, in a category of ""Booker Prize-winning novels"", a puzzle of ""VR NNGDLT TL"" would be correctly answered as ""Vernon God Little"". Teams answer simultaneously using buzzers, and score 1 point for each puzzle they solve, but lose 1 point for guessing incorrectly. The round lasts for two minutes. The team with the most points at the end of the game advances in the tournament. If teams are tied, then a single sudden-death puzzle is given to the captains of each team with no category given. If a captain correctly buzzes in with the correct answer first then their team wins, but an incorrect answer automatically forfeits the game. Ratings.

wikipedia-17544970," DAMPs  Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) also known as danger-associated molecular pattern molecules, are molecules that can initiate and perpetuate immune response in the noninfectious inflammatory response. (In contrast, Pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) initiate and perpetuate the ""infectious"" pathogen inflammatory response.) Many DAMPs are nuclear or cytosolic proteins. When released outside the cell or exposed on the surface of the cell following tissue injury, they move from a reducing to an oxidizing milieu, which results in their denaturation. Also, following necrosis (a kind of cell death), tumor DNA is released outside the nucleus, and outside the cell, and becomes a DAMP.  History. Two papers appearing in the same year presaged the deeper understanding of innate immune reactivity, dictating the subsequent nature of the adaptive immune response. The first came from transplant surgeons who conducted a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Administration of recombinant human superoxide dismutatase (rh-SOD) in recipients of cadaveric renal allografts demonstrated prolonged patient and graft survival with improvement in both acute and chronic rejection events. They speculated that the effect was related to its antioxidant action on the initial ischemia/reperfusion injury of the renal allograft, thereby reducing the immunogenicity of the allograft and the ""grateful dead"" or stressed cells. Thus free radical-mediated reperfusion injury-was seen to contribute to the process of innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. The second, suggested the possibility that the immune system detected ""danger"", through a series of what we would now call damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), working in concert with both positive and negative signals derived from other tissues. Thus these two papers together presaged the modern sense of the role of DAMPs and redox reviewed here, important apparently for both plant and animal resistance to pathogens and the response to cellular injury or damage. Although many immunologists have noticed that various ""Danger signal"" could initiate innate immune responses, the ""DAMP"" was described by Seong and Matzinger in 2004 for the first time. Examples of DAMPs. DAMPs vary greatly depending on the type of cell (epithelial or mesenchymal) and injured tissue. Protein DAMPs include intracellular proteins, such as heat-shock proteins or HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1), and proteins derived from the extracellular matrix that are generated following tissue injury, such as hyaluronan fragments. Examples of non-protein DAMPs include ATP, uric acid, heparin sulfate and DNA. HMGB1. The chromatin-associated protein high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a prototypical leaderless secreted protein secreted by hematopoietic cells through a lysosome-mediated pathway. It is a major mediator of endotoxin shock and acts on several immune cells to trigger inflammatory responses as a DAMP. Known receptors for HMGB1 include TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts). HMGB1 can induce dendritic cell maturation via upregulation of CD80, CD83, CD86 and CD11c, induce production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines in myeloid cells (IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8) as well as upregulate expression of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) on endothelial cells. DNA and RNA. The presence of DNA anywhere other than the nucleus or mitochondria is perceived as a DAMP and triggers responses mediated by TLR9 and DAI that drive cellular activation and immunoreactivity. Interestingly, some tissues such as the gut are inhibited by DNA in their immune response. Similarly, damaged RNAs released from UVB-exposed keratinocytes activate TLR3 on intact keratinocytes. TLR3 activation stimulates TNF-alpha and IL-6 production, which initiate the cutaneous inflammation associated with sunburn. S100 Molecules. S100 is a multigenic family of calcium modulated proteins involved in intracellular and extracellular regulatory activities with a connection to cancer as well as tissue, particularly neuronal, injury. Purine Metabolites adenosine, uric acid. Nucleotides (such as ATP) and nucleosides (such as adenosine) that have reached the extracellular space can also serve as ‘‘danger’’signals. ATP and adenosine are released in high concentrations after catastrophic disruption of the cell, as occurs in necrotic cell death. The immunobiology of these molecules once released into the extracellular milieu is complex. At lower concentrations, extracellular ATP serves as a chemoattractant for immature DCs as well as a maturation signal to upregulate co-stimulatory molecules. At higher concentrations, ATP blocks the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, adenosine has dual effects on the function of the plasmacytoid DC. Uric acid is also an endogenous danger signal released by injured cells  Clinical Targets in Various Disorders. Theoretically, the application of therapeutics in this area to treat disorders as arthritis, cancer, ischemia-reperfusion, myocardial infarction and stroke could include options as:  "

wikipedia-11284397," Chiang Kai Shek College  Chiang Kai Shek College (Traditional Chinese: 菲律濱中正學院; Simplified Chinese: 菲律濱中正学院; Pinyin: Fēilùbīn Zhōngzhèng Xuéyuàn) is a Chinese-Filipino institution of higher learning founded by overseas Chinese-Filipinos, recognized by the government of Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of China(Taiwan). The school offers programs in the preschool, elementary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels. It is the largest Filipino-Chinese school in population in the Philippines. The school is located at 1274 Padre Algue St. Tondo, Manila, Philippines. History. Chiang Kai Shek College was founded by the late Principal, Mr. Wong Chun Seng and the late Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Mr. Yu Khe Thai with other prominent Chinese in Manila in June 1939, beginning with a population of 273 students. Filipino-Chinese locals contributed to its buildings and facilities. The school was named after Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek. Many years later, in the Pacific War, it was heavily damaged, fourteen teachers and students were killed for participating in underground activities. Thus a monument was built in commemoration. In June 1945, through the effort of the former Acting Principal Huang Chi Hwa, the school temporarily opened five review classes for senior and junior high school students. When Mr. Huang left in October, Mr. Pao Shih Tien was designated as the officer-in-charge by the Board of Trustees. Mr. Wong Chun Seng returned in December and was reappointed as the Principal by the Board of Trustees, with Dr. Pao Shih Tien as Acting Principal to assist him. The school reopened in December 1945. Under the management of the late Principal, together with the support of the Chinese community, the school acquired its present site. Student population was close to one thousand when the school moved to its new site in August 1948. On June 15, 1951, the Board of Trustees amended the organization of the school's administration by adding the position of Vice-Principal. Dr. Pao Shih Tien was appointed to this position. In 1955, a Normal School that offered a two-year course for training Chinese teachers opened. Principal Wong Chun Seng died in March 1956. Vice-Principal Pao Shih Tien temporarily took charge of the school's administration until May 1956 when the Board of Trustees appointed its Chairman Yu Khe Thai as Principal and Dr. Pao Shih Tien as Vice-Principal. On April 29, 1959 the Board of Trustees accepted the resignation of Mr. Yu as Principal and appointed Dr. Pao Shih Tien as his successor. The Wong Chun Seng Memorial Pre-School was established in 1958. It offered a one-year Nursery Course and a two-year Kindergarten Course. In 1965, this school became a college with the initial offering of two four-year collegiate courses - Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S.E.), Major in Chinese Literature and History; and Bachelor of Science in Education, Major in General Education. Dr. Pao Shih Tien was the first College President. The High School Department then had a three-year Senior High School and a three-year Junior High School. In 1966, the school started offering four-year courses in Commerce (B.S.C.)with majors in Accounting, Management, Banking and Finance. In 1968, with the opening of the Elementary Course, CKSC became an institution that offers education from kindergarten to college levels. In June 1976, all Chinese schools were Filipinized under the new constitution and Presidential Decree 176. All courses offered in the Collegiate Department are now in accordance with the standard requirements prescribed by the Department of Education. In addition to B.S.E. and B.S.C., Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (B.S.C.S.) and other two-year courses have been offered since 1992. In the High School Department, aside from the four-year General Secondary Course in English, only Chinese Language Arts subjects are allowed to be offered. Granted a permit to offer a two-year College Preparatory Course in Chinese in which some subjects in the previous senior high school curriculum used to be taught, CKSC also offers Chinese Language Arts subjects in the elementary school, besides the complete six-year Elementary Course in English. In June 1979, Dr. Jimmy Su took over the helm of the College, following the retirement of Dr. Pao Shih Tien who had served the school for forty years. After the death of Chairman Yu Khe Thai in April 1983, Dr. Pao Shih Tien assumed office as the Chairman, while Messrs. Dy Tiong, Leoncio Chungunco and Santiago Cua as Vice Chairman. With the retirement of Dr. Jimmy Su in March 1989, the Board of Trustees appointed Mr. Chien Yin Shao as the President of the College. Mr. Chien Yin Shao retired in May 1994. Mrs. Joan Sy Cotio was designated by the Board of Trustees as Acting President. Seven months later, she was appointed to lead the administration as the College President.

wikipedia-3699793," The Grass Harp  The Grass Harp is a novel by Truman Capote published on October 1, 1951 It tells the story of an orphaned boy and two elderly ladies who observe life from a tree. They eventually leave their temporary retreat to make amends with each other and other members of society. Conception. Not wanting to take up his incomplete first novel, ""Summer Crossing"", Capote began writing ""The Grass Harp"" in June 1950 and completed it on May 27, 1951. The novel was inspired by memories of his Alabama childhood, specifically a tree house constructed in the 1930s in a large walnut tree in his cousin Jenny's backyard. This large tree house, accessible by an antique spiral staircase, featured cypress wood construction, a tin roof and was furnished inside with a rattan sofa. Capote would spend time in this tree house with his cousin Sook, or other childhood friends such as Nelle Harper Lee. The novel was additionally inspired by his cousin Sook's dropsy medicine, which she made yearly until the age of 62, and whose recipe she took with her to the grave, despite Jenny's wanting first to patent, and then to sell the recipe to a manufacturer. ""The Grass Harp"" was entirely written while Capote vacationed in Taormina, Sicily. The last section was airmailed to the publishers just days after he finished his writing, but it was not published for four months because the Random House editors, specifically Bob Linscott, did not care for the ending of the novel. Specifically Linscott thought the ending was weak because once the characters were up in the tree house, Capote ""didn't know what to do with them."" He asked Capote to rewrite the ending, and he made some changes, but did not concede to completely rewrite the ending. Truman Capote initially wanted to title the novel ""Music of the Sawgrass"", but ultimately it was Bob Linscott who named it ""The Grass Harp."" Plot summary. The story begins with Collin Fenwick losing his mother, and then his father, and moving into his aunts' (Dolly and Verena) house. Catherine, the servant, also lives in the house and gets along, for the most part, only with Dolly.

Sales of ""The Grass Harp"" reached 13,500, more than double those of either ""A Tree of Night"" or ""Local Color"", two of Capote's prior works. ""The Grass Harp"" was Truman Capote's favorite personal work, despite that it was critiqued as being overly sentimental. Adaptations. Play.

After five previews (October 26, 1971), a Theatre 71 musical play adaptation, with a book and lyrics by Kenward Elmslie and music by Claibe Richardson, opened on November 2, 1971 at the Martin Beck Theatre, where it ran for only seven performances (November 6). The cast, directed by Ellis Rabb, choreography by Rhoda Levine, included Barbara Cook cast as Dolly Talbo, Carol Brice as Catherine Creek, Karen Morrow as evangelist Miss Baby Love, Ruth Ford as Verena Talbo, Russ Thacker as Colin Talbo, Max Showalter as Dr. Morris Ritz, John Baragrey as Judge Cool, Kelley Boa, Trudy Bordoff, Colin Duffy, Eva Grant, David Craig Moskin as Miss Baby Love's orphans, known as the ""Heavenly Pride and Joy"", Christine Stabile as Maude Riordan, and Harvey Vernon as Sheriff Amos Legrand. The musical previewed and opened during a major New York City Newspaper strike preventing advertising and reviews, with no advance theater party ticket sales guarantee. During the previous year, The Michigan Universiy Professional Theatre Program presented the ""Grass Harp"" musical with the university's music and drama departments supplying musicians and performers. Initially as an evaluation by the Broadway Producers Richard Barr, Charles Woodward, Michael Harvey, and Associate Producer Michael Kasden. in a development test, tryout, prior to moving the production to Broadway. Celeste Holm, a close friend of Claibe Richardson, appeared in the Michigan University Professional Program's production as ""Miss Baby Love""; was replaced by Ellis Rabb with Karen Marrow for the Broadway production, because of Holm's weak voice and Celeste's age. (Celeste Holm was ""forced to withdraw"" which created a split with her friendship with Claibe Richardson). Orchestrations were by Jonathan Tunick and Robert Russell Bennett; Theodore Saidenberg was musical director; musical arrangements by J (Billy) Van Planck; dance and incidental music by John Berkman; scenic design and lighting by James Tilton; costumes by Nancy Potts; production stage manager Bruce A. Hoover; Charles Kindl Stage Manager. Richard Barr, Charles Woodward, Michael Harvey, and Michael Kasden gave the company the option of maintaining three more weeks for the productions' performance schedule, or closing after only seven performances, using the show's banked funds to produce a Broadway cast album. The musical orchestration was recorded in Cologne, Germany, with the Cologne Symphonic Orchestra ensemble. Returning to the States, the original cast was recorded in New York City, with the Painted Smiles ""Grass Harp"" vinyl album released a year after the musical's closing date. Because of timing, one musical number was forced off the vinyl, but added when the Painted Smiles ""Grass Harp"" audio CD was released. The Grass Harp album cover art was designed by Kenward Elmslie's fine artist-painter friend Joe Brainard. Claibe Richardson's Advertising Agency Art director-designer friend jim Pearsal designed the Chappell Music Publishing's sheet music design-cover art work. Pearsal's twisted chinaberry tree house design, the Chappell Music Publishing sheet music cover art, replaced the original Brainard vinyl record ""Grass Harp"" cover art work when the Painted Smiles audio CD was issued. Initially, criticism of the show's sound system caused problems, with Truman Capote declaring ""mike it"". The producers could not afford to ""mike"" each member of the ensemble. The Grass Harp production was the last musical presented on Broadway without mikes for the cast. The scenic designer had incorporated ""burlap fabric"" in the production's wing and border designs, causing the deadening of the performer's vocal projections. This poor choice of stage material in the set's design with the absence of microphones for each cast member, especially the children, was the one major technical problem for the producers. Celest Holm must be acknowledged in her power and relentless drive to push the Grass Harp musical, getting an initial performance production, and to the Broadway stage. The ""Grass Harp"" musical presentation rights are controlled by the Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein Organization management team in New York City. The ""Grass Harp"" orchestration score folio, ignored by Richardson and Elmslie when they were offered to purchase the musical's orchestration package from their music publishing organization, have been lost. Efforts to have Johnathan Tunick recreate the musical's orchestration folio have never been finalized because of financial reasons; The Richardson Estate will not agree with financing additional expenses involved with ""The Grass Harp"".

Directed and staged by Adrian Hall, the cast included Barbara Baxley as Dolly Heart Talbo, Carol Brice as the black maid Catherine Creek, Carol Bruce as Verena Talbo, Elaine Stritch as the evangelist Baby Love. After the Providence show trial, Larry Fineberg optioned the property for Broadway, casting Mama Cass as the evangelist Miss Baby Love; Fineberg was unable to raise capital funds, the producing reigns were optioned by Richard Barr. Regrettably, ""The Grass Harp"" was Barbara Cook's last appearance in a Broadway musical's cast as a performer! Film.

Gujarati is the main language spoken in Navsari. Other languages spoken are Hindi and Marathi. Landmarks. The Sayaji Vaibhav Public Library Navsari is an important public building in Navsari. History. Navsari, one of the oldest cities of Gujarat, has an inspiring history of over 2000 years. According to the Greek historical writings, a celebrated Egyptian astronomer and geographer named Ptolemy mentioned about Navsari's port in his book written about 1850 years ago (150 A.D.). The geographic location he showed as Narispa, is in fact the Navsari of today. The origin of the name ""Navsari"" has a very fascinating history. In the past, the city of Navsari has been associated with many names such as Nag Vardhana, Nag Shahi, Nag Sarika, Nag Mandal, Nav Sarika and Nav Sareh. Some of the legends associated with the various names of Navsari are as follows: Shayashray Shiladitya, who ruled over Navsari in the seventh century named this city NAG VARDHANA in honor of his Guru Nag Vardhana. During the same period, the name changed to NAV SARIKA as is evidenced by a recovered copper plate dated 669 A.D. The legend is that Shayashray Shiladttya presented a copper plate to a priest in his town. The copper plate read that Shiladitya, the ruler of ""Nav Sarika,"" had bestowed a nearby village upon this priest of the Kashyapclan. After subduing the rest of Gujarat, Umayyad Muslim invaders were repulsed in the vicinity of Navsari in 120-21 AH/738-39 AD. Another recovered copper plate dated 821 A.D. implies that the city's name later changed into NAG SARIKA. The copper plate indicates that a Rashtrakut king named Kark Suvarna Varsh gave ""Nag Sarika"" as a gift to his teacher named AparaJeet, pupil of Sumati kaharishi, who in turn was a pupil of the famous Digambar Jain teacher Acharya Mallavadi. There is a popular legend behind the name ""Nag Sarika."" Fables suggest that there was a big papal tree on the bank of a pond in the city. A huge Cobra lived in a hollow of this tree. On this same tree, Sarika _ a singing bird _ had her nest. As they resided in the same place, both became friends. Everyday Sarika entertained the Cobra by singing her melodious tunes. The legends have it that due to this remarkable friendship between the Nag (Cobra) and the Sarika (singing bird), the city's name became popular as NAG SARIKA. Another legend of the Nag talks about the origins of a different name for the city: NAG SHAHI. Historically, a Nag (Black Cobra) temple was situated next to a talav (pond) in the city. People worshiped the Black Cobra for its power and Prowess. Although the pond (talav) does not exist any more, the historical Nag Temple still exists in the area known as ""Nag Talavdi"" today. Hence the city came to be known as NAG SHAHI, which means the power and prowess of the Black Cobra. According to the Parsi tradition, in 1142 A.D., when they first came to Navsari, the city was named as NAG MANDAL. The Parsis found the city's atmosphere to that of ""Sari"" region of Iran. In the Persian language, ""now"" means new and ""Sari"" refers to the region in Iran. Hence, the name NAO SARI came into being. The Fourteenth century marked the beginning of Muslim rule in Gujarat. Navsari came under the Muslim rule in the late sixteenth century when its name was changed to NAV SAREH. The anecdote is that according to the Muslim tradition, there were nine ""Sarchs"" of Muslims in the city and hence the name was derived as NAV (Nine) SAREH (Sarchs). The above changes in names show that Navsari, like any other city, has passed through many vicissitudes in the matter of political reign. About fourteen hundred years ago, ""the kings of the Chalukya Dynasty governed the region of Navsari"". Later on, the Parsis, who migrated from Iran, virtually ruled this small town. The reign of the Parsis ended as the Muslim rulers took over. For the last one hundred years, until India's independence in 1947, Navsari was the property of the Gaekwads of Baroda. Navsari is also the birthplace of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of what would later become the Tata Group of companies; he is regarded as the ""father of Indian industry"" Dadabhai Navroji, known as the ""Grand Old Man of India,"" was originally from Navsari. He was an elected Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom between 1892 and 1895, and the first Asian to be a British MP. Transportation.

wikipedia-8744395," Beatritz de Dia  The Comtessa de Dia (Countess of Die), probably named Beatritz or Beatriz (fl. c. 1175), was a trobairitz (female troubadour). She is only known as the ""comtessa de Dia"" in contemporary documents, but was almost certainly named Beatriz and likely the daughter of Count Isoard II of Diá (a town northeast of Montelimar in southern France). According to her ""vida"", she was married to Guillem de Peiteus, count of Valentinois, but was in love with and sang about Raimbaut of Orange (1146-1173). It has been hypothesised that she was in fact married to Guillem's son, Ademar de Peiteus, whose wife's name was Philippa de Fay, and that her real lover was Raimbaut de Vaqueiras. Beatrice's poems were often set to the music of a flute. Five of her works survive, including 4 cansos and 1 tenson. Scholars have debated whether or not Comtessa authored ""Amics, en greu consirier,"" a tenso typically attributed to Raimbaut d'Aurenga. One reason for this is due to the similarities between this composition and her own ""Estat ai en greu consirier."" A second reason references the words in her ""vida,"" ""Et enamoret se d'En Rambaut d' Ashley, e fez de lui mantas bonas cansos"" she fell in love with Sir Raimbaut d'Aurenga, and made about him many good ""cansos"". Her song ""A chantar m'er de so qu'eu no volria"" in the Occitan language is the only ""canso"" by a ""trobairitz"" to survive with its music intact. The music to ""A chantar"" is found only in ""Le manuscript di roi,"" a collection of songs copied around 1270 for Charles of Anjou, the brother of Louis IX. Her extant poems are: Typical subject matter used by Comtessa de Dia in her lyrics includes optimism, praise of herself and her love, as well as betrayal. In ""A chantar,"" Comtessa plays the part of a betrayed lover, and despite the fact she has been betrayed, continues to defend and praise herself. In ""Fin ioi me don'alegranssa,"" however, Comtessa makes fun of the lausengier, a person known for gossiping, comparing those who gossip to a ""cloud that obscures the sun."" In writing style, Comtessa uses a process known as ""coblas singulars"" in ""A chantar,"" repeating the same rhyme scheme in each strophe, but changing the ""a"" rhyme each time. ""Ab ioi,"" on the other hand, uses ""coblas doblas,"" with a rhyme scheme of ab' ab' b' aab'. ""A chantar"" uses some of the motifs of Idyll II of Theocritus. In popular culture.

wikipedia-1463207," Achille Starace  Achille Starace (; August 18, 1889 — April 29, 1945) was a prominent leader of Fascist Italy before and during World War II. Early life and career. Starace was born in Gallipoli in southern Italy near Lecce. He was son of a wine and oil merchant.  Achille Starace attended the Lecce Technical Institute as a young man and earned a degree in accounting. In 1909, he joined the Italian Royal Army (""Regio Esercito "") and by 1912 had become a Second Lieutenant (""Sottotenente"") of the élite sharpshooters (""Bersaglieri"").  Seeing action during World War I, Starace was highly decorated for his service, winning a Silver Medal of Military Valor. After the war, he left the army and moved to Trento, where he first came into contact with the growing Fascist movement.  An ardent nationalist, Starace joined the Fascist movement in Trento in 1920 and quickly became its political secretary. In 1921, his efforts caught the attention of Benito Mussolini, who put Starace in charge of the Fascist organization in Venezia Tridentina. In October 1921, Starace became Vice-Secretary of the National Fascist Party (""Partito Nazionale Fascista"", or PNF). In 1922, Starace participated in the March on Rome (""Marcia su Roma""), leading a squadron (""squadristi"") of Blackshirts (""Camicie Nere"", or CCNN, or ""Squadristi"") in support of Mussolini. Prominence. Later in 1922, Starace was appointed Party Inspector of Sicily and made a member of the Executive Committee of the PNF. In 1923, after resigning as Vice-Secretary of the party, he was made commander of the National Security Volunteer Militia (""Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale"" or MVSN) in Trieste. The MVSN was an all-volunteer militia created to organize former Blackshirts.  In 1924, Starace was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies and made National Party Inspector. In 1926, Achille Starace once again became Vice-Secretary of the PNF, and, in 1928, he was appointed Secretary of the Milan branch of the party. Party secretary. In 1931, his career reached its peak when he was made Party Secretary of the PNF. He was appointed to the position primarily for his unquestioning, fanatical loyalty to Mussolini. As secretary, Starace staged huge parades and marches, proposed Anti-Semitic racial segregation measures, and greatly expanded Mussolini's cult of personality.  Although Starace was successful in increasing party membership, he failed in the later years of his tenure as Secretary to reorganize the Italian Fascist Youth Organization (""Opera Nazionale Balilla"") along the lines of the Hitler Youth (""Hitler-Jugend""). He also failed to inspire a nationwide enthusiasm for Fascism on par with the popularity that the Nazi Party enjoyed in Germany. Starace served as secretary for a total of eight years. This was longer than any other Secretary had served. But, by the mid-1930s, he had gained numerous enemies in the party hierarchy. War hero. In 1935, Starace, a Colonel, took a leave of absence as PNF Party Secretary to participate in the Italian invasion of Ethiopia and fought on the northern front. In March 1936, after the Battle of Shire, he was given command of a mixed group of Blackshirts and ""Bersaglieri"" being assembled in Asmara, Eritrea. Later that month, Starace and his truck-transportable ""mechanized column"" prepared to advance over rough tracks to seize Gondar, the capital of Begemder Province. Before setting out, ""the Panther Man"" (""L'uomo pantera"") gave the following speech to his men:  The roadbuilding skills of Starace's men played an equally important role to their combat prowess. The following morning, April 1, Starace and the column entered Gondar in triumph and two days later reached Lake Tana, securing the border region with British Sudan. The East African Fast Column (""Colonna Celere de Africa Orientale"") had covered approximately 120 km in three days. Return to party secretary. After Ethiopia, Starace resumed his duties as Party Secretary. He continued to be controversial. For example, he decreed that all party flags must be made from an Italian-created textile fabric called ""Lanital."" Based on casein, Lanital was invented in 1935 and, according to Starace, it was a ""product of Italian ingenuity."" In 1936, Dino Grandi, the Italian Ambassador to Great Britain, appeared in London wearing a suit said to have been made from forty-eight pints of skimmed milk. During the Munich Crisis in 1938, Starace was a vocal proponent of the French agreeing to turn over Tunisia to Italy. Dismissal. In October 1939, Starace was finally dismissed as Party Secretary in favor of the popular Ettore Muti. He was made Chief of Staff of the MVSN and he held this position until being dismissed for incompetence in May 1941. He was succeeded by Enzo Galbiati. Imprisonment and death. In 1943, following the demise of Mussolini's regime, Starace was arrested by Pietro Badoglio's Royalist government. He was arrested even though his real power under Mussolini had ended two years earlier.  After unsuccessfully attempting to regain Mussolini's favor in the German-backed Italian Social Republic of Salò, Starace was again arrested. This time he was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Verona and was arrested by his former colleagues on charges that he had weakened the party during his tenure as Party Secretary. Starace was eventually released and moved to Milan. On 29 April 1945, during his morning jog, he was recognized and captured by anti-Fascist Italian partisans. After a summary trial, he was sentenced to death.  Starace was taken to the Piazzale Loreto and shown the body of Mussolini, which he saluted just before he was shot.

Newman agreed to a six-year, $50.2 million extension with the Cowboys on May 20, 2008. Over $22.5 million of the contract was guaranteed over the first three years of the deal. Newman was released by the Cowboys on March 13, 2012. Cincinnati Bengals. Newman signed with the Cincinnati Bengals on April 11, 2012. In 2012 he started 15 games and accumulated over 75 tackles—53 solo and 22 assisted—as well as 10 passes defended, two interceptions, a forced fumble, and two fumble returns. Newman signed a new five-million dollar contract with the Bengals on April 1, 2013. "

wikipedia-296353," Sam Steele  Major General Sir Samuel Benfield Steele, KCMG, CB, MVO (5 January 1848 – 30 January 1919) was a distinguished Canadian soldier and police official. He was an officer of the North-West Mounted Police, most famously as head of the Yukon detachment during the Klondike Gold Rush, and commanding officer of Strathcona's Horse during the Boer War. Early life. Born in a military family at Purbrook. He was the son of Captain The Hon. Elmes Yelverton Steele, R.N., a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, and one of six brothers to have served in the British Armed Forces. His mother (the second wife of his father), Anne Macdonald, was the youngest daughter of Neil Maclain MacDonald of Ardnamurchan, a native of Islay. Neil MacDonald was a grandson of Captain Godfrey MacNeil of Barra, and a nephew of Colonel Donald MacNeil. Sam Steele was named for his father's uncle, Colonel Samuel Steele, who served in Quebec under Lord Amherst. Sam Steele received his education at the family home, Purbrook, and then at the Royal Military College of Canada. By the age of thirteen he was orphaned, and went to live with his elder half-brother, John Steele. Early military career. Following his family's military tradition, in 1866 Steele joined the military during the Fenian raids. Steele also participated in the Red River Expedition in 1870 to fight the Red River Rebellion of Louis Riel. Much to his disappointment, he arrived after the Métis had surrendered. The following year he joined the Permanent Force artillery, Canada's first regular army unit. Steele had long been fascinated by the West, devouring the works of James Fenimore Cooper in his youth. He was especially interested in the First Nations, and spent his time in the West learning from them and the Métis. However, he was assigned to Fort Henry in Kingston, Ontario, for the next few years, as an instructor at the Artillery School. In 1874, Steele was initiated as a Freemason in the Lisgar Lodge No. 2, in Selkirk, Manitoba. Life in the Mounties. In 1873, Steele was the third officer sworn into the newly formed North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), entering as a staff constable. He was one of the officers to lead the new recruits of the NWMP on the 1874 March West, when he returned to Fort Garry, present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba. To him fell the rank of staff sergeant major and the responsibility—as an accomplished horseman and man-at-arms—of drilling the new recruits. In 1878, Steele was given his own command at Fort Qu'Appelle, Northwest Territories. In 1877, he was assigned to meet with Sitting Bull, who, having defeated General Custer at Little Bighorn, had moved with his people into Canada to escape American vengeance. Steele along with U.S. Army General Alfred Howe Terry attempted unsuccessfully to persuade Sitting Bull to return to the United States. (Most of the Sioux did return a few years later.) During the North-West Rebellion Steele was dispatched with a small force. Missing the Battle of Batoche the Mounties were sent to move against the last rebel force led by Big Bear. He was present at the Battle of Frenchman's Butte, where Big Bear's warriors defeated the Canadian forces under General Thomas Bland Strange. Two weeks later, Steele and his two dozen Mounties defeated Big Bear's force at Loon Lake, District of Saskatchewan, in the last battle ever fought on Canadian territory. The contributions of the NWMP in putting down the rebellion went largely ignored and unrewarded, to Steele's great annoyance. By 1885, Steele held the rank of superintendent. He established a NWMP station in the town of Galbraiths Ferry, which was later named to Fort Steele in British Columbia after Steele solved a murder in the town. He then moved on to Fort Macleod, District of Alberta, in 1888.  In 1889, at Fort Macleod, he met Marie-Elizabeth de Lotbinière-Harwood (1859–1951), daughter of Robert William Harwood. They were married at Vaudreuil, Quebec in 1890. They had three children, including Harwood Steele, who would fictionalize episodes from his father's life in novels such as ""Spirit-of-Iron"" (1929). The discovery of gold in the Klondike, Yukon, in the late 1890s presented Steele with a new challenge. Although he campaigned unsuccessfully for the position of assistant commissioner in 1892, in January 1898, he was sent to succeed Charles Constantine as commissioner and to establish customs posts at the head of the White and Chilkoot Passes, and at Lake Bennett. He was noted for his hard line with the hundreds of unruly and independent-minded prospectors, many of them American. To help control the situation, he established the rule that no one would be allowed to enter the Yukon without a ton of goods to support themselves, thus preventing the entry of desperate and potentially unruly speculators and adventurers. Steele and his force made the Klondike Gold Rush one of the most orderly of its kind in history and made the NWMP famous around the world, which ensured its survival at a critical time when the force's dissolution was being debated in Parliament. By July 1898, Steele commanded all the NWMP in the Yukon area, and was a member of the territorial council. As the force reported directly to Ottawa, Steele had almost free rein to run things as he chose, always with an eye towards maintaining law, order and Canadian sovereignty. He moved to Dawson City in September 1898. Boer War and second military career. Always a soldier, in 1900 Steele leapt at the offer of Canadian Pacific Railway tycoon Lord Strathcona to be the first commanding officer of Strathcona's privately raised cavalry unit, Strathcona's Horse. This Canadian light cavalry unit, in British Imperial service, was sent to South Africa during the Second Boer War, where Steele commanded them with distinction in the role of reconnaissance scouts. Steele, however, disliked greatly what he was ordered to do by the British, which included burning towns and moving the populace to concentration camps. After the war, the regiment arrived in London in February 1901. Here they met Lord Strathcona for the first time and were presented with medals by King Edward VII during a visit to Buckingham Palace. Steele was also appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (fourth class) (MVO), a personal gift from the King. On its return to Canada the regiment was disbanded, and the officers received honorary promotions. Steele was promoted to honorary Lieutenant-Colonel in March 1901. After taking the unit back to Canada early in 1901, Steele returned to South Africa that same year to command 'B' Division of the South African Constabulary, a position he held until 1906. On his return to Canada in 1907, Steele assumed command of Military Division No. 13 in Alberta and the District of Mackenzie, and then in 1910 assumed command of Division No. 10 at Winnipeg, where he spent his time regrouping Lord Strathcona's Horse and in preparing his memoirs. Steele requested active military duty upon the outbreak of the First World War. He was initially rejected for command on the grounds of age. However, a compromise was reached which allowed him to act as commander of the 2nd Canadian Division until the unit was sent to France, whereupon he would be replaced. After accompanying the division to England, Steele was offered an administrative post as commanding officer of the South-East District. Matters were complicated, however, when Canadian Minister of Defence Samuel Hughes insisted that Steele also be made commander of all Canadian troops in Europe—a slight problem, as there were two brigadier-generals who each believed the Canadian command was theirs. The issue was not resolved until 1916, when the new Minister of Overseas Military Forces of Canada, Sir G. H. Perley, removed Steele from his Canadian command after Steele refused to return to Canada as a recruiter. He kept his British command until his retirement on 15 July 1918. While in Britain, Steele was knighted, on 1 January 1918, and was made a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. Steele died during the 1918 flu pandemic just after his 71st birthday and was later buried in Winnipeg. Canada's fifth-tallest mountain, Mount Steele, is named after him. CFB Edmonton, the home of Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) is now called Steele Barracks after Major General Steele. Personal papers. On 19 June 2008, Steele's wealth of personal papers and writings were repatriated to Canada in a ceremony in Trafalgar Square in London, England, headed by the Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Steele's papers, believed by historians to contain a wealth of heretofore untold stories that would ""re-write Canadian history"" had been held by British descendants of Steele, and were returned to Canada via a C$1.8MM purchase by the University of Alberta. Fictional references. Hector Adair, a character in the novel ""Spirit-of-Iron"" (1923), written by Steele's son, Harwood Steele, is thought to have been modelled on the famous Mountie. The novel includes a foreword in which the author writes: ""Hector Adair is intended to represent the ideal Mounted Police officer in particular and the British officer generally. He is not to be identified with any historical figure connected with the Force."" Players meet Sam Steele in the 1994 computer simulation game ""The Yukon Trail"". In James Michener's ""Alaska"", ""Major Sam Steele"" is the face of the NWMP. Michener acknowledges him as a historical figure in the notes at the start of the book, but the veracity of his claimed actions is unknown. Steele is also portrayed, along with Jack London, in Don Rosa's Walt Disney comic book ""Hearts of the Yukon"", episode 8C from ""The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck"". In an episode of ""Due South"" (""North""), Fraser references Sam Steele as having been very proud of never firing his weapon while patrolling the Northwest Territories. In several of the short stories James B. Hendryx wrote about the Yukon Gold Rush, Sam Steele is in the background. Usually Steele is investigating a crime. (""Left Handed Justice"", ""Short Stories"" January 1950 issue) Was featured in ""The Klondike Mice"" episode of the kid's show The Country Mouse and City Mouse. "
wikipedia-393084," Cardiacs  Cardiacs are an English rock band formed in 1977, originally as Cardiac Arrest, led by Tim Smith. Noted for their complex, varied and intense compositional style and for their eccentric, theatrical stage shows, they have been hailed as an influence by bands as diverse as Blur, Faith No More and Radiohead.  Cardiacs have released eight studio albums plus a number of live albums, compilation albums and singles between 1980 and 2007, and are best known for the 1988 minor hit single ""Is This the Life?"" They are also noted for attracting strongly diverse responses: they have remained one of Britain's leading cult rock bands during their four-decade-spanning career, but have also attracted virulent critical attack (including a lengthy editorial ban from the British music magazine ""New Musical Express""). The band has been on indefinite (and possibly permanent) hiatus following the 2008 hospitalisation of Tim Smith after a heart attack and series of strokes. Musical & lyrical style. Cardiacs' music is noted for balancing the attack and 'raw energy' of punk rock with the intricacies and technical cleverness of early British progressive rock. The band also incorporates elements of other musical forms such as ska, mediaeval music, folk music, heavy metal, hymns and corporate anthems. The music magazine Organ once commented that ""one Cardiacs song contains more ideas than most other musicians' entire careers.""  The broad combination of styles in the band's music has sometimes been referred to as ""progressive punk"" – or ""pronk"" – and has led to Cardiacs being labelled the primary exponents of this musical style. Tim Smith rejects the term, and prefers the description ""psychedelic"" or simply ""pop"". Musicians which the band have cited as Cardiacs influences include XTC, Van der Graaf Generator, Gong, early Split Enz, Gentle Giant, Alberto Y Los Trios Paranoias, early Genesis, Deaf School and Wire. Smith has stated, ""I don’t know what influences us really, I wouldn’t say that we are influenced by any actual bands in particular"". Tim Smith has denied that Gentle Giant was an influence on the band, but Sarah Smith says that they were. Earlier lineups of the band were sextets and octets employing extensive use of saxophones, percussion and live keyboards. From 1991 onwards, the band was a rock power quartet centred on two guitars (with the remaining keyboard and percussion parts sequenced on tape). Vocally, Cardiacs employ a distinctive singing style centred on Tim Smith's lead vocals (reedy and high-pitched, with a strong punk-styled Estuary English accent) and choral sections (varying from yelled to falsetto) involving most or all of the band. Smith's singing style has been described by music critics as 'skittish'; it has also been commented that his singing voice sounds very similar to his speaking one. The band's music is written almost entirely by Tim Smith, although contributions have been made by other group members.  Smith is also responsible for the majority of the band's lyrics, which are written in a cryptic fractured form of English alternately hailed as poetic or nonsensical. He has generally refused to discuss their content, preferring to keep the words and their inspirations shrouded in mystique and allowing for fan interpretations. Smith has also sometimes employed a cut-up lyrical approach drawing on the works of (among others), William Blake, Charles Kingsley, William Shakespeare and T.S. Eliot. Two favourite cut-and-paste sources are Pedro Carolino’s ""English As She Is Spoke"" (a failed Victorian English-Portuguese phrasebook once hailed by Mark Twain as a perfect example of absurdity) and the nineteenth-century Irish poet George Darley. Fans have also spotted references to the films ""The Night of the Hunter"" and ""Eraserhead"" in Smith's words and music videos. Performance style & mythology. Cardiacs are also renowned for their startling performance style, which has been historically integrated (via video work, publicity, interviews and onstage presentation) with a vague and oppressive band mythology. The latter involves Cardiacs' record label and supposed management company, the Alphabet Business Concern, which shares some similarities with the ""Cryptic Corporation"" supposedly responsible for managing The Residents. As with the Cryptic Corporation, there is a strong possibility that the Alphabet mythology is entirely fictional and that the band – often hailed as archetypal independent musicians – control all aspects of their work themselves. As presented, the Alphabet Business Concern is a repressive, controlling organisation with a vaguely Edwardian character, It supervises (and restricts) Cardiacs' recording work and live appearances (as well as communicating band news and statements to the band's mailing list in florid and archaic corporatese). Several early 1980s video releases by Cardiacs – in particular ""The Consultant's Flower Garden"" and the clip for ""To Go Off and Things"" – provided video ""evidence"" that Alphabet ran Cardiacs' internal affairs in the manner of an Edwardian children's home (complete with behavioural problems and bullying). The corporation's original representatives were Cardiac's """"sordid, waxy"""" manager The Consultant (real name James Stevens) and his assistant and band advisor ""Miss Swift"", both of whom made in-character appearances onstage with Cardiacs during the 1980s. In the late 1980s both The Consultant and Miss Smith left both Cardiacs management and Alphabet. They were replaced by Mark Walmsley, who played a less public role but did appear for inserts in the ""Maresnest"" concert video, expressing contempt for his charges and their music.  In performance, Cardiacs generally reject (or occasionally parody) standard rock band posturing. In keeping with the Alphabet mythology, the band's shows have instead featured behaviour which has been described as ""therapeutic, surrealist pantomime"", compared to absurdist theatre, and labelled ""not so much theatrically eccentric as completely fucking neurotic"". During any given performance, Tim Smith rants between and during numbers, acting out bizarre childlike ideas and emotions. During the 1980s the band perfected a detailed stage act involving shabby lift attendant costumes, badly-applied clown make-up, Tim Smith's bullying of other band members (predominantly his hapless brother and bass player Jim Smith), and a final formal presentation of champagne and flowers by The Consultant and Miss Smith complete with confetti, taking place to ""a euphoric sweep of saxophone and keyboards that wouldn’t seem out of place in a '70s cigar advert."" During the 1990s, the theatrical elements of the live show were toned down and the uniforms replaced by formal suits, although certain rituals (including the childlike mannerisms and Smith's ranting style) were retained. History. Cardiac Arrest (1977–1980). Brothers Jim and Tim Smith grew up in Chessington, Surrey, UK and formed their first musical groups in neighbouring Kingston upon Thames, Greater London. In 1975, a teenaged Tim was playing guitar in a nameless ""punky-psychedelic"" instrumental band with two of his schoolfriends – Mark Cawthra (on drums) and David Philpot (on keyboard). The sound of Philpot's Korg synthesizer was to have a strong impact on Smith and the development of the Cardiacs’ sound.  The band which would eventually become Cardiacs began life in 1977. The initial lineup was Michael Pugh on lead vocals, Tim Smith on guitar and backing vocals, and Peter Tagg on drums. The lineup was completed by Jim Smith, who joined on bass guitar and backing vocals. The Smith brothers, Tagg and Pugh played their first live concert in 1978 at The Kaleidoscope in Kingston upon Thames, under the name of The Filth (sometimes incorrectly remembered as Philip Pilf & The Filth). By the time of their second concert (later in the same year) the band had changed their name to Cardiac Arrest.  Cardiac Arrest produced a seven-song demo at Elephant Studios in London and subsequently expanded to a sextet, adding Colvin Mayers (keyboards) and Ralph Cade (whose contribution was mainly theatrical, involving manic dancing and posturing with a saxophone which he didn't know how to play). The band honed their craft playing a mixture of pubs, youth clubs, schools, hotels and free festivals. In the early years, the band's line-up was flexible according to availability and circumstances – for example, Cardiac Arrest played the 1979 Stonehenge Free Festival as a three piece of Tagg, Mayers and Tim Smith (Smith played both guitar and bass while Mayers alternated between guitar and keyboards). A subsequent concert at Surbiton on 6 July 1979 apparently featured ""about eight to ten people on stage"" (including both Peter Tagg and his brother Derek Tagg).  The debut Cardiac Arrest release was a 7"" single recorded at Elephant Studios called ""A Bus for a Bus on the Bus"", released in 1979 on Tortch Records. Later in the year both Peter Tagg and Ralph Cade left the band (going on to form The Trudy) and the multi-instrumental Mark Cawthra was drafted into Cardiac Arrest to play drums. Michael Pugh also left the band shortly afterwards, and Tim Smith took over lead singer duties as well as guitar playing. By this time Cardiac Arrest operated like a jazz band or football side, keeping various musicians in reserve to cover absences. Many of these people had other roles as part of the technical crew. Future Cardiacs percussionist Tim Quy first performed with the band (as a stand-in bass player) at Snoopies nightclub in Richmond at the start of 1980: this period also saw the arrival of saxophonist Sarah Cutts. Later in 1980, Cardiac Arrest released a self-produced cassette album called ""The Obvious Identity"". The album was produced by Tim Smith with the punk/DIY ethic in mind: as he had little cash to invest in the project, it was recorded onto as many old cassette tapes as he could find. An anonymous member of the band has been quoted as commenting that ""the recordings were so shit it wouldn’t matter if they were copied onto washing up sponges"". Eventually, 1000 cassettes were recorded, but only sold at concerts to save on expenditure. Shortly afterwards, the band discovered that another band was using the name Cardiac Arrest. After a number of experiments with alternative names (including The Alphabet and The Obvious Identity), they finally decided to rename themselves Cardiacs and played their first concert under that name in April 1981. Early Cardiacs (1981–1983). In 1981, Cardiacs self-released the cassette album, ""Toy World"", featuring both new material and recordings dating back to the Cardiac Arrest period. (Consequently, some tracks featured Michael Pugh as lead singer rather than Tim Smith). During 1982, Colvin Mayers left the band to join The Sound (a group led by Adrian Borland and with whom Tim had previously collaborated). Sarah Cutts briefly covered live keyboards as well as saxophone, before Mark Cawthra swapped drums for keyboards and Dominic Luckman was recruited from the road crew as the new drummer. At around the same time percussionist Tim Quy became a full-time member (also doubling on bass synthesizer). In July 1983, Tim Smith married Sarah Cutts – taking his surname, she was henceforward known as Sarah Smith. In mid-1983 Mark Cawthra left the band, to be replaced on keyboards by William D. Drake. Tim Smith had previously met Drake in 1982 at the debut performance of Drake's band Honour Our Trumpet (who promptly invited him to join as bass guitarist.) Following Cawthra's departure, Smith returned Drake's favour by inviting him to join Cardiacs. Drake played his first concert with the band on 31 August 1983. Later in the year, Cardiacs added Marguerite Johnson (alto saxophone) and Graham Simmonds (guitar), and for about a year the band worked as an octet. Both Johnson and Simmonds left during the following summer (in July and August respectively), although Simmonds stayed on as Cardiacs' sound engineer. The ""classic line-up"" established: ""The Seaside"" and ""Seaside Treats"" (mid-1984–1985). By autumn 1984, the band lineup had settled as the sextet generally referred to as ""the classic line-up"" – Tim Smith (lead vocals and guitar), Jim Smith (bass and vocals), William D. Drake (keyboards and vocals), Sarah Smith (saxophones and vocals), Tim Quy (percussion and bass synth) and Dominic Luckman (drums). Between 5 November – 21 December 1984, Cardiacs performed their first major British support tour, supporting Marillion at the personal invitation of Marillion’s vocalist, Fish. Whilst the tour afforded the band a new level of publicity, generally they were not well received by Marillion's fanbase. On most dates of the tour, the band was pelted with a variety of makeshift missiles and irate Marillion fans even set fire to the safety curtain during Cardiacs' performance at the Manchester Apollo show on 17 December. During the 13 December show at the Hammersmith Apollo, Fish himself was indignant enough about the Marillion fans and their hostile behaviour to come onstage during Cardiacs' set and berate the audience about it. The band eventually ducked out of the last three days of the Marillion tour. A Cardiacs spin-off project – Mr and Mrs Smith and Mr Drake – emerged in 1984. As the name suggests, this featured Tim and Sarah Smith plus William D. Drake and consisted of a quieter, more acoustically-orientated take on Cardiacs' music. The project released a self-titled cassette album which was only available via the Cardiacs fan club. Later on, the project would be renamed The Sea Nymphs. On 1 April 1985, an attempt was made to film Cardiacs at a live concert at the Surbiton Assembly Rooms. The band had been approached by film-maker Mark Francombe (later a member of Cranes) and his colleague Nick Elborough, both of whom were at that time students at Portsmouth College of Art and Design. Francombe and Elborough offered to film the band for free as part of their coursework project. However, when the band viewed the resultant footage, they decided against releasing it. Instead, they retained Francombe and Elborough for a new video project which would become ""Seaside Treats"", named after the 12"" single that was released at the same time. As well as containing three music videos, ""Seaside Treats"" contained a ten-minute film named ""The Consultant’s Flower Garden"". The latter featured Cardiacs (and various people connected with them) in bizarre, comedic situations which continued to propagate the absurdist Alphabet Business Concern mythology which surrounded the band. On the verge of success: ""Big Ship"", ""A Little Man and a House"" & ""On Land and in the Sea"" (1986–1989). In 1986, Cardiacs released the mini-album ""Big Ship"" (the title track would prove to be one of their most enduring anthems). The band played the Reading Festival on 24 August, releasing the very rough audio footage as the ""Rude Bootleg"" album. On 17 April, the band's music video for ""Tarred and Feathered"" (from the ""Big Ship"" mini-album) was broadcast on Channel 4's groundbreaking music show, ""The Tube"", giving Cardiacs their first exposure on national television. Later in the year, Cardiacs released a 12-inch single called ""There's Too Many Irons In The Fire"". In October, a live-in-the-studio session was recorded and broadcast by BBC Radio Leeds, followed in December by a similar session on BBC Radio 1 for Janice Long's ""Night Track"" show. Later in the year, Cardiacs recorded tracks for what would become their fifth studio album, ""On Land and in the Sea"" which was released in 1989. The album successfully consolidated the intricate style and unusual songwriting vision of ""A Little Man and a House..."", but the stable line-up which the band had enjoyed for four years was now beginning to weaken. The ""classic line-up"" fractures – ""Maresnest"" and multiple departures (1989–1991). Over the following two years, the Cardiacs lineup began to disintegrate. Sarah Smith left the band suddenly in April 1989 and was not replaced, removing saxophone from the standard Cardiacs sound. Although Sarah would not rejoin the band, she would retain a long-term connection with Cardiacs by playing on future albums and would very occasionally appear as a special guest for live concerts. Tim Smith brought in a second guitarist – Christian 'Bic' Hayes, formerly of Ring and The Dave Howard Singers – and the new two-guitar line-up toured extensively around the UK and Europe for the rest of the year (with Sarah Smith making the first of her special guest appearances at a Brixton Fridge concert on 17 September). During this period, the band also released ""Archive Cardiacs"", a collection of material from the 1976–83 period (some of it previously unreleased).  Cardiacs toured and gigged intermittently during 1990, culminating in a shared concert with Napalm Death at Salisbury Arts Centre on 30 August. The Cardiacs half of the concert was filmed and released as the video ""Maresnest"" (produced by Steve Mallet and directed by Steve Payne, and eventually also released as the 1995 live album ""All that Glitters is a Mares Nest""). The band performed as a seven-piece, with Sarah Smith making a one-day return as a band member. Although the concert has achieved legendary status amongst Cardiacs fans, it was also an occasion on which everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Among other things, Tim Smith's guitar fell apart and keys fell off Sarah Smith's saxophone. After the Salisbury concert, Tim Quy left the band to pursue other projects. Like Sarah Smith, he was not replaced: the removal of live tuned and untuned percussion from the lineup further altered the established Cardiacs sound. Quy's departure was commemorated by a message at the end of the ""Maresnest"" video stating ""this film is dedicated to Tim Quy who left our world 30/8/90"". (At the time, this was widely misinterpreted as an announcement of Quy's death). The band was quiet for the first four months of 1991, during which time both William D. Drake and Christian Hayes also left. Drake played his final concert with the band on 2 May at The Venue in New Cross, London and Hayes played his own final gig as a Cardiac in Oxford on 16 May. By now, Hayes had joined up-and-coming psychedelic indie-prog band, Levitation: although the bands were friendly with each other, and had even toured together, Hayes finally found it impossible to balance the demands of both Levitation and Cardiacs. (Drake, meanwhile, would join the band Nervous but continue his connection with Cardiacs. In 2001, he embarked on a long-delayed solo career.) The power quartet established: ""Heaven Born and Ever Bright"" and the Rough Trade debacle (1991–1994). Although the band had historically been well-used to line-up changes, Cardiacs were profoundly affected by the multiple departures taking place between 1989 and 1991. A particular blow had been the departure of William D. Drake, whose virtuoso keyboard skills and compositional input had made him one of the backbones of the band. Christian Hayes was replaced as second guitarist by Jon Poole (who had previously played with the Cardiacs-inspired Milton Keynes band Ad Nauseam). Drake was considered irreplaceable and Cardiacs opted not to look for a new keyboard player, remaining as a quartet of two guitars, bass and drums. While Cardiacs was still able to record more fully orchestrated music in the studio, a lack of suitable personnel (or the budget to keep them in place) meant that the live band had to change drastically. Abandoning several signature musical features (saxophone, assorted percussion and virtuoso keyboards), Cardiacs' live music shifted away from the wider instrumentation of the past and moved towards a more guitar-heavy, power-rock sound in line with the remaining quartet lineup. However, the music remained complex, if narrower in focus, and Smith recorded additional keyboard and percussion parts onto backing tapes for the band to play over. Before 1991 was over, the revitalised band had released a new single, called ""Day Is Gone"", and played several concerts from October to December. This year also saw the release of ""Songs for Ships and Irons"", which compiled material from the ""Big Ship"" mini-album plus various singles and EPs. Also making an appearance in 1991 was the debut release by the Cardiacs spin-off, The Sea Nymphs. Their debut single, ""Appealing To Venus"", was a free bonus item with the first 500 copies of ""Day Is Gone"" and was subsequently sold through the fan club. The debut Sea Nymphs album, ""The Sea Nymphs"", was released in 1992. Cardiacs remained active during 1992, touring frequently within the UK, including a double-headed tour with Levitation. On one notable occasion, at a 4 June gig at the London Astoria, Cardiacs were supported by future British rock megastars Radiohead, then at the start of their career. Prior to the departure of Christian Hayes, Cardiacs had recorded an album called ""Heaven Born and Ever Bright"" (which featured several of Hayes' guitar and vocal parts, plus a track he had co-written called ""Goodbye Grace""). This was released as the new Cardiacs album in the summer of 1992, the first fruit of a new distribution deal with Rough Trade Records. However, disaster struck when Rough Trade ceased trading shortly after the release of the album. This ensured that ""Heaven Born and Ever Bright"" could neither be stocked nor ordered by record shops, with the result that Cardiacs were left thousands of pounds in debt and unable to recoup their recording expenses. (The album was eventually reissued on a revived Alphabet Business Concern in 1995 – it featured a picture of Jon Poole on the cover, although he had not actually played on the album when it was recorded.)  Despite this crippling blow, the band soldiered on, but by July 1993 yet another long-term member – drummer Dominic Luckman – had decided to quit. He played his last concert as a Cardiac member on 20 July at Camden Palace, London (and would later join The Shrubbies). In December 1993, Cardiacs revealed their new drummer, Jon Poole's former Ad Nauseam bandmate, Bob Leith. However, the following year proved to be Cardiacs' quietest year for a long time, with only four concerts played in total. The comeback: ""Sing to God"" & ""Guns"" (1995–1999). After three years without any new releases, 1995 saw the release of the ""Bellyeye"" single on Org Records (the record-releasing wing of long-term Cardiacs’ supporters Organ Magazine). This was a taster for Cardiacs’ most epic recorded effort to date. ""Sing to God"" was a double album, due to the sheer amount of material that Tim had written over a number of years. The album was notable for a change in Cardiacs' working methods – whereas most previous material had been written and arranged by Smith, the ""Sing to God"" sessions saw extensive contributions from Jon Poole who played a strong role in orchestrating Smith's basic material with detailed riffs and keyboard parts (and contributed several songs entirely written by himself). Drummer Bob Leith also made significant contributions to the album's lyrics. ""Sing to God"" was released in two formats – as a limited edition double CD, and as two separate CDs. At the same time, the band reissued almost their entire back catalogue on CD. This constituted all of the albums from ""The Seaside"" onwards, CD issues of live album ""All that Glitters is a Mares Nest"" and the ""Archive Cardiacs"" compilation, and a new compilation, the ""Cardiacs Sampler"". In April 1995, Cardiacs performed a BBC Manchester radio session on Mark Radcliffe's show. During May, they toured with Pura Vida and Sidi Bou Said and recorded a live acoustic session for GLR Radio. On 17 June, they appeared as special guests of (and concert openers for) Blur at their triumphant London Mile End Stadium concert. From 31 October to 18 November, Cardiacs performed a long support stint on Chumbawamba's UK tour.  In June and November 1996, Cardiacs embarked on two UK tours of their own, most significantly filling the London Astoria 2 on 2 November. The June tour was promoted by a second BBC Manchester radio session with Mark Radcliffe, aired on 11 June. The next two years saw no new music from Cardiacs and reduced live activity. However, there were three more London concerts in 1998 – at one of these (the Garage concert on 4 December) the band was joined for an encore by William D. Drake. During the same year Cardiacs also played several performances in Germany and Holland, and made appearances in Brighton and at a festival in St Austell in Cornwall. 1998 also saw renewed activity by The Sea Nymphs, with the ""Appealing To Venus"" single reissued with extra tracks by Org Records, and a rare concert at the Camden Falcon in north London. Rare sightings, family gatherings and a lost album (2000–2002). During 1999–2000, Cardiacs began composing songs for a new album (including the Jon Poole composition ""Sparkly Silvery Sky"", which is still occasionally played at concerts by both Cardiacs and Poole's current band, God Damn Whores). Unfortunately, the songs were lost after an accident in the recording studio and the album was never released. Cardiacs concerts were also rare over the next few years, although the band played the Glastonbury Festival on 23 June 2000 and played two subsequent Whitchurch Festivals on 5 August 2000 and 3 August 2001.  Counterbalancing the lack of tours, the band set up an annual tradition of one-off large-scale London concerts (the first of which took place on 11 November 2000 and the last in 2007). These usually took place in November at the London Astoria, and soon became a kind of Cardiacs family gathering in which the band was joined by various guests including former members and newer Cardiacs-inspired supported bands. During these concerts, Sarah Smith, William D. Drake, Christian Hayes and Dominic Luckman all appeared onstage with the band on various occasions, as did The Consultant and Miss Smith. Support bands were always musicians with a professed Cardiacs connection or influence, and included Oceansize, The Monsoon Bassoon, The Scaramanga Six, Stars In Battledress and Jon Poole's hard-rock band GodDamnWhores. The Garage Concerts, lineup changes and reestablishment (2003–2008). Between 17 October – 19 October 2003, Cardiacs recorded three special concerts at the Highbury Garage venue in London. As Jon Poole was by now also the bass player for The Wildhearts (and busy rehearsing for the upcoming Wildhearts tour) he was replaced for the concert by Kavus Torabi (formerly guitarist and singer for Monsoon Bassoon, Torabi was also a long-standing Cardiacs’ associate who'd served as their guitar technician since the mid-1990s.) For these concerts, the band delved back into their distant past, abandoning virtually all of their available back catalogue in favour of exclusively playing songs that had been performed prior to 1983. These were taken mostly from the cassette albums (""The Obvious Identity"" and ""Toy World"", but also included songs such as ""An Ant"", ""Hopeless"", ""Gloomy News"" and ""Hello Mr Minnow"" (which had never been officially recorded before and had only ever been played at concerts in the late '70s/early '80s). A two-volume CD set of recordings from the three shows – ""The Special Garage Concerts Vol I"" and ""The Special Garage Concerts Vol II"" – was eventually released in 2005. Professional video camera equipment was apparently seen being used to record the band during the concerts, leading to a rumour that members of Org Records had filmed the entire three nights for later video release. This was debunked by Torabi in a 2009 interview, in which he stated that no such recordings existed. In the autumn of 2004, Torabi officially replaced Poole as Cardiacs' second guitarist, and made his formal debut as a full group member at the annual London Astoria concert on 12 November (Poole would go on to concentrate on GodDamnWhores, various Wildhearts-related projects, Crayola Lectern and others). A number of other new members were drafted into the Cardiacs line-up at the same time – three backing singers (Claire Lemmon and Melanie Woods of Sidi Bou Said, plus former Shrubbies and current North Sea Radio Orchestra singer Sharron Fortnam) and two percussionists – Cathy Harabaras and Dawn Staple – playing mostly bass drums. (The official status of most of these additional members remains unclear, although Sharron Fortnam is known to have left the band.) After several years of limited live activity in front of established fans, Cardiacs made another attempt to recapture their momentum and play to fresh audiences by supporting long-terms fans The Wildhearts for the latter's tour between 8–15 December 2004. This tour saw another substitution – drummer Stephen Gilchrist (Graham Coxon, The Scaramanga Six, Stuffy/The Fuses) stood in for Bob Leith, who had previous tour commitments with art-punk band Blurt. Three more years of relative quietness (bar the yearly concerts) ended in 2007 when Cardiacs released their first new material for eight years: the ""Ditzy Scene"" single. Released on Org Records as a limited edition of 1,000 copies, '""Ditzy Scene"" was also the first release by the new lineup: on record this included Claire, Melanie, Cathy and Dawn, but the 2007 winter tour featured only Melanie and Cathy, both of whom were now playing percussion and singing. Tim Smith's heart attack and consequent band hiatus (2008–present). At the end of June 2008, Tim Smith collapsed from a heart attack and major stroke after leaving a My Bloody Valentine concert. While in hospital, he suffered a second stroke which left him in a severely debilitated condition. All Cardiacs-related releases and activity (including the unfinished work-in-progress album, provisionally entitled ""LSD"") were immediately shelved until further notice. A year of silence followed during which Smith recuperated in private. In June 2009 a new announcement appeared on the official Cardiacs website, letting readers know that, after a year of rehabilitation, Tim Smith's mind had returned to full functionality and that ""no part of your favourite pop star’s intellect or personality has been found to be absent whatsoever."" It thanked fans for their kind thoughts and made clear Smith's interest in returning to playing music with Cardiacs at such time as his physical rehabilitation allowed. However, it became clear that such rehabilitation would be a long process; and in August 2010, Kavus Torabi stated in an interview podcast that Cardiacs would never play live again. At time of writing, Smith remains hospitalised in a neurological rehabilitation centre in Wiltshire. In December 2010, two tribute CDs, """" and its limited edition companion ""Leader of the Starry Skies - A Loyal Companion"", were compiled by former Cardiac Christian Hayes and former Spratleys Japs singer Jo Spratley. These were released on Kavus Torabi's record label Believers Roast, with all proceeds going directly to the continuing care of Tim Smith. The albums featured cover versions of Smith-penned material (originally for Cardiacs, The Sea Nymphs, Spratleys Japs and OceanLandWorld) by musicians including The Magic Numbers, Steven Wilson, Oceansize, Robert White/Andy Partridge, Sidi Bou Said and North Sea Radio Orchestra as well as former Cardiacs including Hayes himself (as Mikrokosmos), Torabi (as Knifeworld), William D. Drake, Mark Cawthra and Peter Tagg (with The Trudy). Legacy. While the critical status of Cardiacs is wildly mixed (the band tends to attract extreme responses with some critics hailing them while others violently condemn them to the point of pariahhood), Cardiacs are renowned for their unique performing and songwriting styles and their poetically cryptic, philosophical and abstract lyrics, as well as for their ability to produce a unique, complex and innovative sound with all their musical ventures over and over again throughout their long career. Tim Smith regularly attracts fulsome praise: he has been described in the music press as the ""Mozart"" or ""Beethoven"" of rock and pop music for his complex and innovative compositional skills, as well as being hailed as a genius (albeit sometimes a ""deranged"" one). The snooker player Steve Davis is also a big fan of the band and attended many of their live gigs. Cardiacs have had a profound underground influence on over three decades of musicians, including the pioneers of the nu-metal and avant-garde metal genres. The band has also influenced math rock artists such as The Monsoon Bassoon and Battles. The band are sometimes credited as having been the inventors of the ""pronk"" (progressive punk) music genre; Tim Smith has rejected the term from the off, stating that Cardiacs are better described as a pop group or a psychedelic rock band. Musicians who have cited Tim Smith's work as a major influence include Mike Vennart of Oceansize, Mike Patton of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, Tool, Korn and Thom Yorke of Radiohead. During the 1980s, Cardiacs were a professed influence or inspiration for Marillion, It Bites and British psychedelic acts such as Ring; during the 1990s, emerging bands and musicians who were Cardiacs fans included Blur, Radiohead, Supergrass Shane Embury of Napalm Death, Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson, The Scaramanga Six, The Monsoon Bassoon and The Wildhearts (who would later pay direct tribute via their track ""Tim Smith"" on 2009's ""Chutzpah!""). In recent years Cardiacs has been influencing a new generation of underground bands such as Rocketgoldstar, Little Trophy, The Display Team, Liberty Ships and Silvery. Literature. A black and white A5 booklet of lyrics, drawings and band photographs, created by Tim Smith, was available at Cardiacs gigs for a few years from 1984, appropriately titled 'Cardiacs Book'. No official Cardiacs histories or biographies have been published. The ORGAN fanzine produced a Cardiacs anthology of interviews and reviews in 1993. In November 2006 The Organ announced that they would be putting together a book incorporating the previous anthology, interviews and features that been in Organ since that anthology was published and contributions from fans.

wikipedia-2668875," Samba de Gafieira  Samba de Gafieira (also called Gafieira) is a partner dance to the Brazilian samba musical rhythms.  Samba de Gafieira must be distinguished from the ballroom Samba, danced in International Latin and American Rhythm ballroom dance styles. Gafieira is usually a pair dance, although in artistic performances it is not uncommon to add solo variations, including steps of Samba no Pé. Word meaning. The word ""gafieira"" can also refer to the traditional samba music orchestra, as well as the dance hall where it is performed. The term ""gafieira"" was Brazilian Portuguese slang meaning ""low dancing resort, gaff, honky-tonk"" or ""dance festivity frequented by the populace"". Origins. The style originated fom samba dancing in cabarets and ""gafieiras"" (hence the name, literally meaning ""Samba of gafieira""), primarily in districts of Botafogo, Catete and Centro of Rio de Janeiro. The term gained recognition in 1940s. Over time the style significantly evolved away from the style 1940s under significant influence of Argentine Tango and incorporating many acrobatic elements."" Beginners' steps. Like Argentine Tango, Gafieira is danced in either open embrace, where lead and follow connect at arms length, or close embrace, where the lead and follow connect chest-to-chest. Passo basico. Passo basico (""Basic step"", sometimes called Quadrado (""box step"") or Quadradinho) is a simple beginner's step with rhythm ""quick-quick-slow"" over 4 beat measure.  It is not really a box step, but rather similar to the ""Basic movement"" of the international ballroom Samba syllabus, and its 8-beat basis step sequence is performed in reverse, with the leader moving his left foot back on ""three"" and his right foot forward on ""seven"".  The lateral movements on ""one"" and ""two"" and on ""five"" and ""six"" are almost in place (or sometimes on ""one"" moving the left foot slightly forward and on ""five"" moving the right foot slightly backward). Often only a half of the ""passo basico"" is used, e.g., as part of other, more complicated step patterns. Saída Lateral. The Saída Lateral or Saída ao lado (both literally mean ""exit to side"", ""lateral exit"", sometimes translated as ""right cross body lead"") step is used to enter or exit many other more elaborate Gafieira steps.  To execute the figure, start with the first 5 footsteps of the ""Passo Basico"", with the leader's 5th step taken slightly backwards, slightly parting form the follower. The leader's 6th (slow, right foot) step is forward left across the standing foot outside the partner. The follower's 6th step is backward sideways, crossing the left foot behind. In descriptions of more complicated patterns, ""Saída ao Lado"" often refers to only the last three described steps. Syllabus. In 2001, a meeting of teachers took place in Rio de Janeiro, where a common syllabus of main steps for Samba de Gafieira was established, for unified teaching and competitions. The voted syllabus excluded acrobatic steps, i.e., the ones where both feet of a dancer are off the ground. It also excluded steps not characteristic to Brazilian dance. The syllabus is divided into three categories: Nível Básico (Basic Level, or ""Bronze""), Nível Intermediário (Intermediate Level, or""Silver""), and Nível Avançado (Advanced Level, or ""Gold""). Samba de Gafieira is not resricted to the syllabus, which only lists steps commonly agreed to be most important. New steps may be created or entries and exits of the described steps modified, provided they preserve the spirit of Samba de Gafieira. "
wikipedia-225886," Maitreya  Maitreya (Sanskrit), Metteyya (Pāli), Maithree (Sinhala), Jampa (Tibetan) or Di-Lặc in Vietnamese, is regarded by Buddhists as a future Buddha of this world in Buddhist eschatology. In some Buddhist literature, such as the Amitabha Sutra and the Lotus Sutra, he is referred to as ""Ajita"" Bodhisattva. Maitreya is a bodhisattva who in the Buddhist tradition is to appear on Earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure dharma. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor of the historic Śākyamuni Buddha. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya refers to a time when the Dharma will have been forgotten by most on Jambudvipa. It is found in the canonical literature of all major Buddhist schools (Theravāda, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna), and is accepted by most Buddhists as a statement about an event that will take place when the Dharma will have been mostly forgotten on Earth. Origins. The name ""Maitreya"" (""Metteyya"" in Pāli) is derived from the Sanskrit word ""maitrī"" (Pāli: ""mettā"") meaning ""loving-kindness"", which is in turn derived from the noun ""mitra"" (Pāli: ""mitta"") in the sense of ""friend"". Metteyya is mentioned in the Cakavatti (Sihanada) Sutta (Digha Nikaya 26) of the Pali Canon. He appears in no other sutta in the Pali Canon, and this has cast doubt as to the sutta's authenticity. Most of the Buddha's sermons are presented as having been presented in answer to a question, or in some other appropriate context, but this sutta has a beginning and ending in which the Buddha is talking to monks about something totally different. This leads Gombrich to conclude that either the whole sutta is apocryphal, or that it has at least been tampered with. Maitreya is sometimes represented seated on a throne Western-style, and venerated both in Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna Buddhism. Some have speculated that inspiration for Maitreya may have come from the ancient Indo-Iranian deity Mithra. The primary comparison between the two characters appears to be the similarity of their names. According to a book entitled ""The Religion of the Iranian Peoples"", ""No one who has studied the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyants or the coming saviour-prophets can fail to see their resemblance to the future Maitreya"". Paul Williams claims that some Zoroastrian ideas like Saoshyant influenced the beliefs about Maitreya, such as ""expectations of a heavenly helper, the need to opt for positive righteousness, the future millennium, and universal salvation"". Possible objections are that these characteristics are not unique to Zoroastrianism, nor are they necessarily characteristic of the belief in Maitreya. It is also possible that Maitreya Buddha originated with the Hindu Kalki, and that its similarities with the Iranian Mithra have to do with their common Indo-Iranian origin. In the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, in the first centuries CE in northern India, Maitreya was the most popular figure to be represented, together with the Buddha Śākyamuni. In China, in the 4th–6th Centuries ""Buddhist artisans used the names Shakyamuni and Maitreya interchangeably... indicating both that the distinction between the two had not yet been drawn and that their respective iconographies had not yet been firmly set"" An example is the stone sculpture found in the Qingzhou cache dedicated to Maitreya in 529 CE as recorded in the inscription (currently in the Qingzhou Museum, Shandong). The religious belief of Maitreya apparently developed around the same time as that of Amitābha, as early as the 3rd century CE. Characteristics. One mention of the prophecy of Maitreya is in the Sanskrit text, the """" (The Prophecy of Maitreya). It implies that he is a teacher of meditative trance sadhana and states that gods, men and other beings: will lose their doubts, and the torrents of their cravings will be cut off: free from all misery they will manage to cross the ocean of becoming; and, as a result of Maitreya's teachings, they will lead a holy life. No longer will they regard anything as their own, they will have no possession, no gold or silver, no home, no relatives! But they will lead the holy life of oneness under Maitreya's guidance. They will have torn the net of the passions, they will manage to enter into trances, and theirs will be an abundance of joy and happiness, for they will lead a holy life under Maitreya's guidance. (Trans. in Conze 1959:241) General description. Maitreya is typically pictured seated, with either both feet on the ground or crossed at the ankles, on a throne, waiting for his time. He is dressed in the clothes of either a Bhiksu or Indian royalty. As a bodhisattva, he would usually be standing and dressed in jewels. Usually he wears a small stupa in his headdress that represents the stupa of the Buddha Sakyamuni's relics to help him identify it when his turn comes to lay claim to his succession, and can be holding a dharmachakra resting on a lotus. A khata is always tied around his waist as a girdle. The Stupa on his head was actually seen from disciples when Maitreya received teachings from his master Buddha Shakyamuni as a sign of his outstanding devotion. That's the reason why he's pictured with a Stupa either on his head or in his hands. Also the original Stupa was a Crystal one, which stands for the purity of his devotion. In the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, in the first centuries CE in northern India, Maitreya is represented as a Central Asian or northern Indian nobleman, holding a ""water phial"" (Sanskrit: ""Kumbha"") in his left hand. Sometimes this is a ""wisdom urn"" (Sanskrit: ""Bumpa""). He is flanked by his two acolytes, the brothers Asanga and Vasubandhu. Maitreya-samiti was an extensive Buddhist play in Pre-Islamic Central Asia. The Maitreyavyakarana (in Sataka form) in Central Asia and Anagatavamsa in South India also mention him. Some Buddhists wished to stay with him after death. I-kuan Tao have different descriptions of him. Maitreya's Heaven. Maitreya currently resides in the """" Heaven (Pāli: ""Tusita""), said to be reachable through meditation. Śākyamuni Buddha also lived here before he was born into the world as all bodhisattvas live in the Heaven before they descend to the human realm to become Buddhas. Although all bodhisattvas are destined to become Buddhas, the concept of a bodhisattva differs greatly in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. In Theravada Buddhism, a bodhisattva is one who is striving for full enlightenment (Arahantship in Pali), whereas in Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva is one who has already reached a very advanced state of grace or enlightenment but holds back from entering nirvana so that he may help others. In Mahayana Buddhism, once Maitreya becomes a Buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati Pure Land, an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the Indian city of Varanasi (also known as Benares) in Uttar Pradesh. In Mahayana Buddhism, Buddhas preside over a Pure Land (the Buddha Amitabha presides over the Sukhavati Pure Land, more popularly known as the Western Paradise). In Theravadin Buddhism, Buddhas are born as unenlightened humans, and are not rulers of any paradise or pure land. Maitreya's arising would be no different to the arising of Shakyamuni Buddha, as he achieved full-enlightenment as a human being, and passed away into parinibbana when the conditions were ripe for his final passing. Orthodox Theravadin doctrine has much less emphasis on deities and Bodhisattvas, and do not view Bodhisattvas to be in an unachievable state. Activity of Maitreya in the current age. In Mahayana schools, Maitreya is traditionally said to have revealed the Five Treatises of Maitreya through Asanga. These important texts are the basis of the Yogachara tradition and constitute the majority of the Third Turning of the Wheel of Dharma. Future coming of Maitreya. Maitreya will be the fifth Buddha of the present ""kalpa"" (aeon) and his arrival will occur after the teachings (dharma) of the Buddha are no longer practiced. His coming is characterized by a number of physical events. The oceans are predicted to decrease in size, allowing Maitreya to traverse them freely. Maitreya will then reintroduce ""true"" ""dharma"" to the world. His arrival signifies the end of the middle time, the time between the fourth Buddha, Gautama Buddha, and the fifth Buddha, Maitreya, which is viewed as a low point of human existence. According to the ""Cakkavatti Sutta: The Wheel-turning Emperor"", Digha Nikaya 26 of the Sutta Pitaka of the Pāli Canon), Maitreya Buddha will be born in a time when humans will live to an age of eighty thousand years, in the city of Ketumatī (present Benares), whose king will be the Cakkavattī Sankha. Sankha will live in the palace where once dwelt King Mahāpanadā, but later he will give the palace away and will himself become a follower of Maitreya Buddha. The scriptures say that Maitreya will attain ""bodhi"" in seven days (which is the minimum period), by virtue of his many lives of preparation for Buddhahood (similar to those reported in the Jataka stories of Shakyamuni Buddha). At this time a notable teaching he will start giving is that of the ten non-virtuous deeds (killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views) and the ten virtuous deeds (the abandonment of: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views). The Arya Maitreya Mandala, founded by Lama Anagarika Govinda is based on the idea of the future coming of Maitreya. Nichiren Buddhism and Maitreya as metaphor. According to the Lotus Sutra of Nichiren Buddhism, all persons possess the potential to reveal an innate Buddha nature during their own lifetimes, a concept which may appear to contradict the concept of Buddha as savior or messiah. Although Maitreya is a significant figure in the Lotus Sutra, the explanation of Nichiren is that Maitreya is a metaphor of stewardship and aid for the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, as written in the Lotus Sutra: Non-Buddhist views. The concept of Maitreya was elaborated within Theosophy during the last few decades of the 19th century. However the Theosophical Maitreya was explained, and developed, differently than the original Buddhist concept. In Theosophical texts Maitreya has multiple aspects signifying not just the future Buddha, but similar concepts from other religious or spiritual traditions. In early 20th century, leading Theosophists became convinced that an appearance of the Maitreya as a so-called ""World Teacher"" was imminent. A South Indian boy, Jiddu Krishnamurti, was thought to be destined as the ""vehicle"" of the soon-to-manifest Maitreya; however the manifestation did not happen as predicted, and did not fulfil Theosophists' expectations. Since the growth of the Theosophical movement in the 19th century, and influenced by Theosophy's articulations on the Maitreya, non-Buddhist religious and spiritual movements have adopted and reinterpreted the concept in their doctrines. Share International, which equates Maitreya with the prophesied figures of multiple religious traditions, claims that he is already present in the world, but is preparing to make an open declaration of his presence in the near future. They claim that he is here to inspire mankind to create a new era based on sharing and justice. In the beginning of the 1930s, the Ascended Master Teachings placed Maitreya in the ""Office of World Teacher"" until 1956, when he was described as moving on to the ""Office of Planetary Buddha"" and ""Cosmic Christ"" in their concept of a Spiritual Hierarchy. Some Muslim scholars who studied Buddhist texts believe that Maitreya is ""Rahmatu lil-'alameen"" (Mercy for The Worlds), which is the name for the prophet Muhammad as it is said in the Qur'an. According to the research on the book ""Antim Buddha - Maitreya"" scholars have surmised that Maitreya Buddha is Muhammad. After examining the Buddhist texts researchers concluded that Muhammad had been the last and final awakened Buddha to come into existence long after the current teachings. The 19th-century Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is believed in by the members of the Ahmadiyya Community (the faith he brought) as fulfilling expectations regarding the Maitreya Buddha. Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the fulfillment of the prophecy of appearance of Maitreya. Bahá'ís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace. Maitreya claimants. Since his death, the Chinese monk Budai (Hotei) has been popularly regarded as an incarnation of the bodhisattva Maitreya. His depiction as the ""Laughing Buddha"" continues to be very popular in East Asian culture. While a number of persons have proclaimed themselves to be Maitreya over the years following the Buddha’s parinirvana, none have been officially recognized by the sangha and Buddhists. A particular difficulty faced by any would-be claimant to Maitreya's title is the fact that the Buddha is considered to have made a number of fairly specific predictions regarding the circumstances that would occur prior to Maitreya's coming; such as that the teachings of the Buddha would be completely forgotten, and all of the remaining relics of Sakyamuni Buddha would be gathered in Bodh Gaya and cremated. The following list is just a small selection of those people who claimed or claim to be the incarnation of Maitreya. Many have either used the Maitreya incarnation claim to form a new Buddhist sect or have used the name of Maitreya to form a new religious movement or cult. Maitreya sects in China. Pre-Maitreyan Buddhist messianic rebellions. Southern and Northern Dynasties. Although a ""new Buddha"" was mentioned, these rebellions are not considered ""Maitreyan"" by modern scholars. However, they would be a later influence on the rebel religious leaders that made such claims. Therefore, it is important to mention these rebellions in this context. Maitreyan rebellions. Yuan and Ming Dynasty. This suggests that the Ming Dynasty was named after the White Lotus figures of the ""Big and Little Bright Kings"". Post-Maitreyan rebellions. Qing Dynasty. Albeit not in the name of Maitreya, both rebellions were perpetrated solely or in part by the White Lotus Society, a rebellious Maitreya sect. Alternative persona. There was a sage of the same name in the epic Mahabharata. His lineage is unknown. He came to the court of Hastinapura to advise Duryodhana to restore the kingdom of the Pandavas, a little while after the sons of Pandu had gone into exile, having been defeated at dice. However, Duryodhana didn't even bother to listen to the sage, and showed his disrespect all too plainly. Incensed, the sage cursed him and said, ""Fourteen years hence, you shall be destroyed in battle by the Pandavas, along with your kinsmen and all that you hold dear. Bheema shall dispatch you to the abode of Yama, by breaking your thighs with the mace."" Some hold that the curse of this sage played a major part in encompassing the destruction of the Kauravas. "
wikipedia-10150076," Social rule system theory  Social rule system theory is an attempt to formally approach different kinds of social rule systems in a unified manner. Social rules systems include institutions such as norms, laws, regulations, taboos, customs, and a variety of related concepts and are important in the social sciences and humanities. Social rule system theory is fundamentally an institutionalist approach to the social sciences, both in its placing primacy on institutions and in its use of sets of rules to define concepts in social theory. Overview. Social rule system theory notes that most human social activity is organized and regulated by socially produced and reproduced systems of rules. These rules have a tangible existence in societies – in language, customs and codes of conduct, norms and laws, and in social institutions such as family, community, market, business enterprises, and government agencies. Thus, this theory posits that the making, interpretation, and implementation of social rules are universal in human society, as are their reformulation and transformation.  Human agents (individuals, groups, organizations, communities, and other collectivities) produce, carry, and reform these systems of social rules, and this frequently takes place in ways they neither intend nor expect. This does not mean that social rule systems do not change. They can and do, and that change can be endogenous and exogenous to the society. The implementation of rules – and the maintenance of some order – always calls for cumulative experience, adjustment, adaptation, etc. In such ways, normative and institutional innovation is generated. There is a continual interplay – a dialectic, if you will – between the regulated and the unregulated.  What is more, at the same time that social rule systems strongly influence actions and interactions, they are formed and reformed by the actors involved. Human agency is manifest in this dialectical process, played out by participating actors having their specific competencies and endowments, their situational analyses, interpretations, and strategic responses to immediate pushes and pulls to which they are subject. History. The development of a more systematic conceptualization and theorizing about social rules and systems of social rules emerged in the late 1970s in the collaborative work of Thomas Baumgartner, Tom R. Burns, Philippe DeVille, and later Helena Flam, Reinier de Man, Atle Midttun, Anders Olsson, and others. Its formalization stemmed from a number of articles in the early 1980s.  Social theory concepts such as norm, value, belief, role, social relationship, and institution as well as game were shown to be definable in a uniform way in terms of rules and rule complexes. Rules and rule configurations may be treated as mathematical objects (the mathematics is based on contemporary developments at the interface of mathematics, logic, and computer science. Rules may be imprecise, possibly inconsistent, and open to a greater or lesser extent to modification and transformation by the participants. Rules are key concepts in the new institutionalism, in several variants of socio-cultural evolutionary theory, and in work in semiotics, linguistics, and philosophy on “language games”. Among the many other researchers developing and applying rule concepts in the social sciences. In general, much of the use of rule concept in the social sciences and humanities has been informal and even metaphorical, with the major exception of Chomsky. Social rules and the patterning of action. Social rule systems are used to examine all levels of human interaction. They provide more than potential constraints on action possibilities. They also generate opportunities for social actors to behave in ways that would otherwise be impossible, for instance, to coordinate with others, to mobilize and to gain systematic access to strategic resources, to command and allocate substantial human and physical resources, and to solve complex social problems by organizing collective actions. In guiding and regulating interaction, social rules give behavior recognizable, characteristic patterns, and make such patterns understandable and meaningful for those who share in the rule knowledge. Culture and institutional arrangements. On the macro-level of culture and institutional arrangements, rule system complexes are examined: language, cultural codes and forms, institutional arrangements, shared paradigms, norms and “rules of the game”. On the actor level, one refers to roles, particular norms, strategies, action paradigms, and social grammars (for example, procedures of order, turn taking, and voting in committees and democratic bodies). There are not only role grammars but semantics and pragmatics. There are processes of meaning, interpretation, and adaptation associated with rule application and implementation.  Grammars of action are associated with culturally defined roles and institutional domains, indicating particular ways of thinking and acting. In that sense, the grammars are both social and conventional. For instance, in the case of gift giving or reciprocity in defined social relationships, actors display a competence in knowing when a gift should be given or not, how much it should be worth, or, if one should fail to give it or if it lies under the appropriate value, what excuses, defenses and justifications might be acceptable. Someone ignorant of these rules, e.g. a child or someone from a totally different culture would obviously make mistakes (for which they would probably be excused by others). Similarly, in the case of ""making a promise,"" rule knowledge indicates under what circumstances a promise may or may not legitimately be broken – or at least the sort of breach of a promise that might be considered acceptable. In guiding and regulating interaction, the rules give behavior recognizable, characteristic patterns.  To varying degrees actors collectively produce and reproduce patterns of appropriate or acceptable possibilities. This can be conceptualized and mathematically developed as an ideal point or collection of ""approximations"". Thus, a community of actors sharing a rule complex recognize a wide variety of varying performances of a given rule as a family of resemblances, or ""the same thing.” Both in this sense – and in the sense that social rules are never learned identically and undergo different rates of adaptation and change over time – the concept of rule, and of culture generally, is distributive.  – making the patterns understandable and meaningful for those sharing in the rule knowledge.  Shared rules are the major basis for knowledgeable actors to derive, or to generate, similar situational expectations. They also provide a frame of reference and categories, enabling participants to readily communicate about and to analyze social activities and events. In such ways, uncertainty is reduced, predictability is increased. This is so even in complex situations with multiple actors playing different roles and engaging in a variety of interaction patterns. As Harre and Secord (1972:12) point out, “It is the self-monitoring following of rules and plans that we believe to be the social scientific analogue of the working of generative causal mechanisms in the processes which produce the non-random patterns studied by natural scientists.” Cognitive processes. Social rule systems play then an important role in cognitive processes, in part by enabling actors to organize and to frame perceptions in a given institutional setting or domain. On the basis of a more or less a common rule system, questions such as the following can be intersubjectively and collectively answered:  The participating actors can understand the situation in intersubjective ways. In a certain sense, they can simulate and predict what will happen in the interactions on the basis of the applied rules. Hence, rule systems provide not only a basis for interpretative schemes but also the concrete basis for actors to plan and judge actions and interactions.  Social rules are also important in normative and moral communications about social action and interaction. Participants refer to the rules in giving accounts, in justifying or criticizing what is being done (or not done), in arguing for what should or should not be done, and also in their social attribution of who should or should not be blamed for performance failures, or credited with success. Actors also exploit rules when they give accounts in order to try to justify certain actions or failures to act, as part of a strategy to gain legitimacy, or to convince others that particular actions are ""right and proper"" in the context. Textually encoded social rules. So called formal rules are found in sacred books, legal codes, handbooks of rules and regulations, or in the design of organizations or technologies that an elite or dominant group seeks to impose in a particular social setting. For instance, a formal organization such as a bureaucracy consists of, among other features, a well-defined hierarchical authority structure, explicit goals and policies, and clear-cut specialization of function or division of labor.  Informal rules appear less ""legislated"" and more ""spontaneous"" than formal rules. They are generated and reproduced in ongoing interactions. The extent to which the formal and informal rule systems diverge or contradict one another varies. Numerous organizational studies have revealed that official, formal rules are not always those that operate in practice. In some cases the informal unwritten rules not only contradict formal rules but take precedence over them under some conditions. Informal rules emerge for a variety of reasons. In part, formal rules fail to completely specify action (that is provide complete directions) or to cover all relevant (or emergent) situations.  The situations (in which rules are applied or implemented) are particularistic, even idiosyncratic, whereas formal rules of behavior are more or less general. In some situations (especially emergent or new situations), actors may be uncertain or disagree about which rules apply or about the ways in which to apply them. They engage in situational analyses and rule modification, or even rule innovation out of which emerge informal rules (which may be formalized later). Interpretation and variability. However strongly actions are patterned by rules, social life is sufficiently complex that some imagination and interpretation are required in applying rules to a specific action and interaction context. Imagination generates variability in action from actor to actor, and even for a given actor over time.  Rules are also interpreted in their application. Even highly formalized, systematic rules such as laws and written rules of bureaucracy are never complete in their specification. They have to be interpreted and applied using situational information and knowledge. Adaptations and improvisations are common, even in the most formally organized institutions. In this sense, rules are generative, and their interpretation and implementation more or less context-dependent.  Interpretation varies across a population sharing a rule system, and also across time. In addition, rules will sometimes be learned or implemented with error, providing in some cases an incorrect model for others. Both of these factors result in variability. Moreover, if an action at deviance with cultural rules or standard interpretations is perceived by other actors as advantageous, it may be copied, thus spreading what becomes a new cultural variant. Adherence to and compliance with social rules. Actors adhere to and implement rule and rule systems to varying degrees. Compliance with, or refusal to comply with, particular rules are complicated cognitive and normative processes. Typically, there are diverse reasons for rule compliance. Several of the most important factors are: As indicated above, some social rules are enforced, others not: indeed, rules can be distinguished on the basis of the degree to which, and the circumstances under which, they are socially enforced or enforceable. Of course, regardless of the degree of enforceability, they may be complied with because of a desire for order, intrinsic sanctions, or realizing one’s role and self-identity. Many rules that actors rigorously adhere to are not socially enforceable, but nevertheless actors utilize them in organizing social activities and in shaping social order. Harre and Secord (1972:17) emphasize the freedom of choice in relation to rules and roles: ""The mechanistic model is strongly deterministic; the role-rule model is not. Rules are not laws, they can be ignored or broken, if we admit that human beings are self-governing agents rather than objects controlled by external forces, aware of themselves only as helpless spectators of the flow of physical causality.""  Social rule system theory and complex institutional arrangements. On meso- and macro-levels of analysis, social rule system theory is applied to the description and analysis of institutions such as bureaucracy, markets, political systems, and science – major orders in modern societies. This entails more than a study of social structure, or a contribution to neo-institutionalism.  It is a theory that analyses the links between social structure in the form of particular institutional arrangements including role relationships, on the one hand, and social action and social interaction, on the other. The theory shows, for example, in what ways markets and bureaucracies are organized and regulated by social rules at the same time that actors, both inside and outside these institutions, maintain or change the organizing principles and rules through their actions and interactions. The actors involved in a given institution use their institutional knowledge of relationships, roles, norms, and procedures to guide and organize their actions and interactions. But they also use it to understand and interpret what is going on, to plan and simulate scenarios, and to refer to in making commentaries and in giving and asking for accounts. Rule system theory stresses rule-based cognitive processes such as framing, contextualizing, and classifying objects, persons, and actions in a relevant or meaningful way (Carson, 2004). In general, the cultural complex of rule systems contributes to making social life more or less orderly and predictable and solves problems of ""existential uncertainty"" within the group, organization, or community bearing and adhering to the rule culture. As suggested earlier, however, there is always a tension and a dynamic between the regulated and the unregulated, order and disorder (this is also pointed up in empirical studies. It also considers the production of appropriate or meaningful accounts, discourses, and commentaries in the context of the given institution. In line with the new institutionalism, social rule system theory stresses that particular institutions and their organizational instantiations are deeply embedded in cultural, social, and political environments and that particular structures and practices are often reflections of as well as responses to rules, laws, conventions, paradigms built into the wider environment. Rule system change and evolution. Institutional change entails changes in particular rule complexes and/or enforcement activities to the effect that new or deviant patterns of action and interaction are generated and encouraged. Social rule system theorists point to three major power mechanisms of rule system reproduction and change to explain the evolution of social rule systems and institutional arrangements: the selective action of the environment; the constraining and facilitating conditions of institutional arrangements with their technologies, available resources, and participants; and creative/destructive human agency. Selective environments operate to bring about the successes of some rule structures and the failure of others and, thereby, shifts in the prevalence of different forms. Rule system changes may be also initiated by social agents. For instance, an elite ""legislates"" an institutional change, or a social movement brings about change through coming to direct power or effectively pressuring and negotiating with an established power elite. Changes are also brought about through more dispersed processes, e.g. where one or more agents of a population discover a new technical or performance strategy and others copy the strategy, and, in this way, the rule innovation diffuses through social networks of communication and exchange.  The introduction by social agents of new rules and their expression in transformed patterns of action or in innovative physical artifacts – such as technologies and socio-technical infrastructures – is a major part of institutional change and evolution. In other words, institutionalized changes may be brought about by the ""selective forces"" of social as well as physical environments or by the direct action of social agents. This model of change is applicable to economic, political, administrative, socio-technical, and scientific institutional arrangements. "
wikipedia-1224343," Abdul Sattar Edhi  Dr. Abdul Sattar Edhi, NI, LPP, RMA, IBP, GPA, MSP (Memoni, , ), or Maulana Edhi, is a prominent Pakistani philanthropist, social activist and humanitarian. He is the founder and head of the Edhi Foundation, a non-profit social welfare organization in Pakistan. Together with his wife, Bilquis Edhi, he received the 1986 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service. He is also the recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize and the Balzan Prize. In 2006, Institute of Business Administration Pakistan conferred an honoris causa degree of Doctor of Social Service Management for his services. In September 2010, Edhi was also awarded an honorary degree of Doctorate by the University of Bedfordshire.In 1985 Edhi received the Nishan-e-Imtiaz from the Government of Pakistan. He was born in 1928, in the city of Bantva in which is now western India. Edhi's first interaction with human suffering occurred at the age of eleven, when his mother was physically paralyzed and later suffered from mental illness. Edhi spent his waking hours caring for her, and her worsening health and eventual death left a lasting impact on his life. In 1947, at the age of 19, Mr. Edhi's family was forced to flee their hometown and relocate to Karachi. Finding himself in a new city without any resources, Edhi resolved to dedicate his life to aiding the poor, and over the last sixty years, he has single handedly changed the face of welfare in Pakistan. Edhi founded the Edhi Foundation, with an initial sum of a mere five thousand rupees. Regarded as a guardian for the poor, Edhi began receiving numerous donations, which allowed him to expand his services. To this day, the Edhi Foundation continues to grow in both size and service, and is currently the largest welfare organization in Pakistan. Since its inception, the Edhi Foundation has rescued over 20,000 abandoned infants, rehabilitated over 50,000 orphans and has trained over 40,000 nurses. It also runs over three hundred and thirty welfare centers in rural and urban Pakistan which operate as food kitchens, rehabilitation homes, shelters for abandoned women and children and clinics for the mentally handicapped. Edhi has remained a simple and humble man. To this day, he owns two pairs of clothes, has never taken a salary from his organization and lives in a small two bedroom apartment over his clinic in Karachi. He has been recommended for a Nobel Peace prize by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. On June 25, 2013 Edhi’s kidneys failed and it was announced that he will be on dialysis for the rest of his life. Early life. Edhi was born in 1928 in Bantva in the Gujarat, India. When he was eleven, his mother became paralyzed and later grew mentally ill and died when he was 19. His personal experiences caused him to develop a system of services for old, mentally ill and challenged people. Edhi and his family migrated to Pakistan in 1947. He initially started as a pedlar, later became a commission agent selling cloth in the wholesale market in Karachi. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with the help from his community. He later established a welfare trust, ""Edhi Trust"". Abdul Sattar Edhi was married in 1965 to Bilquis, a nurse who worked at the Edhi dispensary. The couple have four children, two daughters and two sons. Bilquis runs the free maternity home at the headquarter in Karachi and organizes the adoption of illegitimate and abandoned babies.. Charity work. Edhi Foundation runs the world's largest ambulance service and operates free nursing homes, orphanages, clinics, women's shelters, and rehab centers for drug addicts and mentally ill individuals. It has run relief operations in Africa, Middle East, the Caucasus region, eastern Europe and US where it provided aid following the New Orleans hurricane of 2005. In November 2011, Edhi was recommended for a Nobel Peace prize by the Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani. Abdul Sattar Edhi suffers Renal Failure as announced on 26 June 2013 at SIUT and needs kidney donation. Travel issues. In the early 1980s he was arrested by Israeli troops while entering Lebanon. In 2006, he was detained in Toronto, Canada, for 16 hours. In January 2008, US immigration officials interrogated Edhi at the John F. Kennedy Airport in New York for over eight hours, and seized his passport and other documents. When asked about the frequent detention, Edhi said ""The only explanation I can think of is my beard and my dress."" In January 2009, Edhi was refused entry to Gaza by Egyptian authorities. "

wikipedia-1554425," Master cylinder  In automotive engineering, the master cylinder is a control device that converts non-hydraulic pressure (commonly from a driver's foot) into hydraulic pressure. This device controls slave cylinders located at the other end of the hydraulic system. As piston(s) move along the bore of the master cylinder, this movement is transferred through the hydraulic fluid, to result in a movement of the slave cylinder(s). The hydraulic pressure created by moving a piston (inside the bore of the master cylinder) toward the slave cylinder(s) compresses the fluid evenly, but by varying the comparative surface-area of the master cylinder and/or each slave cylinder, one can vary the amount of force and displacement applied to each slave cylinder, relative to the amount of force and displacement applied to the master cylinder. Vehicle applications. The most common vehicle uses of master cylinders are in brake and clutch systems. In brake systems, the operated devices are cylinders inside of brake calipers and/or drum brakes; these cylinders may be called wheel cylinders or slave cylinders, and they push the brake pads towards a surface that rotates with the wheel (this surface is typically either a drum, or a disc, a.k.a. a rotor) until the stationary brake pad(s) create friction against that rotating surface (typically the rotating surface is metal or ceramic/carbon, for their ability to withstand heat and friction without wearing-down rapidly). In the clutch system, the device which the master cylinder operates is called the slave cylinder; it moves the throw out bearing until the high-friction material on the transmission's clutch disengages from the engine's metal (or ceramic/carbon) flywheel. For hydraulic brakes or clutches alike, flexible high-pressure hoses or inflexible hard-walled metal tubing may be used; but the flexible variety of tubing is needed for at least a short length adjacent to each wheel, whenever the wheel can move relative to the car's chassis (this is the case on any car with steering and other suspension movements; some drag racers and go-karts have no rear suspension, as the rear axle is welded to the chassis, and some antique cars also have no rear suspension movement). A reservoir above each master cylinder supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air from entering the master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, but it may also be referred to as ""clutch fluid"" in a clutch application). Most modern light trucks and passenger cars have one master cylinder for the brakes which contains two pistons; but many racing vehicles, as well as some classic and antique cars, have two separate master cylinders, each with only one piston (much like hydraulic clutches typically have only 1 piston per master cylinder). Each piston in a master cylinder operates a brake circuit, and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a brake circuit leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other brake circuit provides brake-pressure to power the other two brakes. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability at the same time; it results in longer stopping distances and should be fixed immediately, but at least gives some braking ability, which is preferable to having no braking ability.

wikipedia-39494880," Whitfield Cook  George Whitfield Cook III (April 9, 1909 – November 12, 2003) was an American writer of screenplays, stage plays, short stories and novels, best known for his contributions to two Alfred Hitchcock films, ""Stage Fright"" and ""Strangers on a Train"". He also wrote scripts for several TV series, including ""Suspense"", ""Climax!"" and ""Playhouse 90"". Life and Career. George Whitfield Cook III was born on April 9, 1909 in Montclair, New Jersey, the son of engineer George W. Cook and his wife, the former Hortense Heyse. He began writing short stories as a child and later cited Walter de la Mare and Virginia Woolf as major influences. He attended and graduated from the Yale School of Drama. Cook began his career as a writer in the late thirties with stories in ""The American Mercury"", ""Story"" and ""Cosmopolitan"". One of these stories, ""The Unfaithful,"" won an O. Henry Award in the ""Best First-Published"" category in 1943. In the early forties, Cook wrote a series of stories for Redbook about a precocious teenage girl named Violet who helps to untangle her father's love life, and in 1944 dramatized these in a play called ""Violet"". The play, which Cook also directed, only ran on Broadway for 23 performances, but it starred Patricia Hitchcock as Violet, and brought Cook to the attention of her father, Alfred Hitchcock. In 1945, Cook headed to Hollywood, where he was partnered with Ann Morrison Chapin on a trio of film scripts that starred June Allyson. He made his debut with the romantic comedy ""The Sailor Takes a Wife"" (1945) and followed with the psychological drama ""The Sacred Heart"" (1946) and the wartime romance ""High Barbaree"" (1947). Cook then worked with Hitchcock and his wife, Alma Reville, on ""Stage Fright"" (1950) and ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951). Cook's treatment for ""Strangers on a Train"" is usually given credit for the film's homoerotic subtext (only hinted at in the novel) and the softening of the villain, Bruno, from the coarse alcoholic of the book into a dapper, charming mama's boy. For his work on ""Stage Fright"", Cook was nominated for a 1951 Edgar Allen Poe Award in the Best Motion Picture category. For the remainder of the fifties, Cook worked in television, contributing scripts to series such as ""Studio One in Hollywood"", ""Suspense"", ""Front Row Center"", ""Playhouse 90"", ""Climax!"", ""Have Gun – Will Travel"" and ""77 Sunset Strip"". Cook wrote four books: Legacy. In the 2012 film ""Hitchcock"", Cook was portrayed by Danny Huston as a charmer trying to persuade Hitchock's wife into having an extra-marital affair. The New Dramatists of New York City annually bestow a Whitfield Cook Award on a playwright for the best unproduced, unpublished play, as determined by a jury. "
wikipedia-239521," MG 34  The ""Maschinengewehr"" 34, or MG 34, is a German recoil-operated air-cooled machine gun that was first tested in 1929 and was introduced in 1934, and first issued to units in 1936. It accepts the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge. The versatile MG 34 was arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time of its adoption and deployment with the German Army. It entered service in great numbers following Hitler's repudiation of the Versailles Treaty in 1936, and was first tested by German troops aiding Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. The MG 34 combined four substantial advantages over other machine guns: As such, it can generally be considered to be the world's first general-purpose machine gun. History. Development. The MG 34 was based on a 1930 Rheinmetall design, the MG 30. The Swiss and Austrian militaries had both licensed and produced the MG 30 from Rheinmetall shortly after patent. The MG 30 design was adapted and modified by Heinrich Vollmer of Mauser Industries. Vollmer modified the feed mechanism to accept either drum magazines or belt ammunition. He also increased the rate of fire. The MG 34's double crescent trigger dictated either semiautomatic or fully automatic firing modes. In the field, the weapon could operate in offensive or defensive applications. The offensive model, with a mobile soldier, used a drum magazine that could hold either 50 or 75 rounds of ammunition. In a stationary defensive role, the gun was mounted on a bipod or tripod and fed by an ammunition belt. Belts were carried in boxes of five. Each belt contained 50 rounds. Belt lengths could be linked for sustained fire. During sustained fire, barrels would have to be changed at intervals due to the heat generated by the rapid rate of fire. If the barrels were not changed properly, the weapon would misfire. Changing barrels was a rapid process for the trained operator and involved disengaging a latch and swinging the receiver to the right for the insertion of a new barrel. Accordingly, stationary defensive positions required more than one operator. The MG 34 was the mainstay of German Army support weapons from the time of its first issue in 1935 until 1942, when it was supplanted by the next generation Maschinengewehr 42 or MG 42. Although the 34 was very reliable and dominant on the battlefield, its dissemination throughout the German forces was hampered due to its precision engineering, which resulted in high production costs and a relatively slower rate of production. For its successor, the MG 42, the Germans instead used mass production techniques similar to those that created the MP 40 submachine gun. However, the Germans nevertheless continued widespread production of MG 34s until the end of the war. MG34 in Europe. The MG 34 was used as the primary infantry machine gun during the 1930s, and remained as the primary tank and aircraft defensive weapon. It was to be replaced in infantry service by the related MG42, but there were never enough quantities of the new design to go around, and MG 34s soldiered on in all roles until the end of World War II. The MG 34 was intended to replace the MG13 and other older machine guns, but these were still being used in World War II as demand was never met. It was designed primarily by Heinrich Vollmer from the Mauser Werke, based on the recently introduced Rheinmetall-designed Solothurn 1930 (MG30) that was starting to enter service in Switzerland. Changes to the operating mechanism improved the rate of fire to between 800 and 900 rpm. The new gun was accepted for service almost immediately and was generally liked by the troops, and it was used to great effect by German soldiers assisting Nationalist Spain in the Spanish Civil War. At the time it was introduced, it had a number of advanced features and the general-purpose machine gun concept that it aspired to was an influential one. However, the MG 34 was also expensive, both in terms of construction and the raw materials needed ( of steel), and its manufacture was too time-consuming to be built in the numbers required for the ever-expanding German armed forces. It was the standard machine gun of the Kriegsmarine (German navy). MG34 in East Asia. Imported units of MG 34s, as well as indigenous copies of the weapon were adopted by Chinese Nationalist forces during both World War II and the Chinese Civil War. Some models captured from the Germans by the Soviets or French were supplied to the People's Liberation Army/People's Volunteer Army, Korean People's Army, PAVN and the Viet Cong over the Cold War. Today an MG34 can be found in the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution which was captured from the Chinese Nationalist Army during the Chinese Civil War. Characteristics. The MG 34 could use both magazine-fed and belt-fed 7.92 mm ammunition. Belts were supplied in a fixed length of 50 rounds, but could be linked up to make longer belts for sustained firing. A 250 round belt was also issued to machine guns installed in fixed emplacements such as bunkers. Ammunition boxes contained 250 rounds in five belts that were linked to make one continuous 100 round belt and one 150 round belt. The assault drums held a 50-round belt, or a 75-round ""double drum"" magazine could be used by replacing the top cover with one made specially for that purpose. A gun configured to use the 75-round magazine could not be returned to belt-feed mode without changing the top cover again. All magazine-feed MG 34s had been withdrawn from infantry use by 1941, with some remaining in use on armoured personnel carriers. Like most machine guns, the MG 34's barrel is designed to be easily replaced to avoid overheating during sustained fire. During a barrel change, the operator would disengage a latch which held the receiver to the barrel sleeve. The entire receiver then pivoted off to the right, allowing the operator to pull the barrel out the back of the sleeve. A new barrel would then be put in the back of the sleeve, and the receiver rotated back in line with the barrel sleeve and latched. The entire process took just a few seconds when performed by a well-trained operator, causing minimal downtime in battle. A unique feature of the MG 34 was its double-crescent trigger, which provided select fire capability without the need for a fire mode selector switch. Pressing the upper segment of the trigger produced semi-automatic fire, while holding the lower segment of the trigger produced fully automatic fire. Though considered innovative at the time, the feature was eliminated due to its complexity on the MG 34's successor, the MG42. In the light-machine gun role, it was used with a bipod and weighed only . In the medium-machine gun role, it could be mounted on one of two tripods, a smaller one weighing , the larger . The larger tripod, the MG 34 ""Laffette"", included a number of features, such as a telescopic sight and special sighting equipment for indirect fire. The legs could be extended to allow it to be used in the anti-aircraft role, and when lowered, it could be placed to allow the gun to be fired ""remotely"" while it swept an arc in front of the mounting with fire, or aimed through a periscope attached to the tripod. Another unique feature of German World War II machine guns (and which continued to be used by the German Bundeswehr after the war) was the Tiefenfeuerautomat. If selected, this feature walked the fire in wave like motions up and down the range in a predefined area. E.g., being unsure whether the real distance was 2000 meters or 2300 meters, the gunner could make the mount do an automatic sweep between the elevations for 1900 to 2400 meters and back. This sweeping of a given range (Tiefenfeuer) continued as long as the gun fired. Variants. MG 34/41(MG 34S). The MG 34/41 was requested as the first war experiences in the beginning of World War II proved that a higher fire rate generates more dispersion of the bullets. The MG 34/41 could cope with a fire rate of 1200 rpm. The weight of the MG 34/41 was 14 kg, slightly more than the original MG 34 version. A limited number of MG 34/41 were produced. The MG 34/41 was beaten in trials by the MG 39/41, later designated MG 42. MG 34 Panzerlauf. Most German tanks used during World War II used the MG 34 ""Panzerlauf"" for secondary armament. The MG 42 was ill-suited for internal/coaxial mounting due to the method of barrel change. The main difference of the MG 34 Panzerlauf and the regular MG 34 was the heavier almost solid armored barrel shroud, almost completely lacking the ventilation holes of the basic MG 34. When mounted inside a tank, the MG 34 also lacked a butt-stock. A kit for quick conversion to ground use was carried inside the tank containing a butt-stock and a combined bi-pod and front sight assembly. MG 81. The MG 34 was also used as the basis of a new aircraft-mounted machine gun, the MG 81 machine gun. For this role, the breech was slightly modified to allow feeds from either side, and in one version, two guns were bolted together on a single trigger to form a weapon known as the MG 81Z (for ""zwilling"", German for ""twin"" as in twin-mounted). Production of the MG 34 was never enough to satisfy any of its users, and while the MG81 was a huge improvement over the earlier MG 30-based MG 15 and MG 17 guns, these guns were used until the end of the war. As the Luftwaffe lost the battle for air superiority and declined in priority in the German war effort, MG 15s and MG 81s, which were designed as flexibly mounted aircraft machine guns, were modified and adapted for ground use by infantry, with varying degrees of success.

He was only seventeen when he produced a statue of the Madonna of considerable merit; and having studied under Louis Lerambert and having further trained himself by taking copies in marble from Roman sculptures (among others from the ""Venus de Medici"" and the ""Castor and Pollux""), he was engaged by the bishop of Strasbourg, Cardinal Fürstenberg, to adorn with statuary his château at Saverne (Zabern). In 1666 he married Marguerite Quillerier, Lerambert's niece, who died a year after the marriage. In 1671, after four years spent working at Saverne, which was subsequently destroyed by fire in 1780, he returned to Paris. In 1676 his bust of the king's painter Charles Le Brun obtained admission for him to the Académie Royale. A year later he married Claude Bourdict. For niches on the façade of Jules Hardouin-Mansart's royal chapel at Les Invalides he was commissioned to produced a ""Charlemagne"" (""illustration"") as a pendant to Nicolas Coustou's ""Louis XI"". On the upper storey stand his ""Cardinal Virtues"". In consequence of the coordination of official arts that was exercised by Charles Le Brun between the years 1677 and 1685, he was employed on behalf of Louis XIV in producing much of the decoration and a large number of statues for Versailles; and he afterwards worked, between 1701 and 1709, with no less facility and success, for the Château de Marly, subsequently largely abandoned, then destroyed in the Revolution. He executed ""Justice"" and ""Force"" and the ""River Garonne"" at Versailles. Among his works from Marly are the ""Mercury"" and the equestrian ""Fame"" (1702) and four groups commissioned for the ""river"" in the château's park; ""La Seine"" and its pendant at the head of the cascade, ""La Marne"", ""Neptune"" and ""Amphitrite"". Models in weather-resistant stucco were set up in 1699, replaced by marbles when they were finished in 1705. The groups were seized as ""biens nationaux"" in 1796 and dispersed: the ""Seine"" and ""Marne"" went to Saint-Cloud and the ""Neptune"" and ""Amphitrite"" went to Brest in 1801. In his portrait sculptures the likenesses were said to have been remarkably successful; he produced portrait busts of most of the celebrated men of his age, including Louis XIV and Louis XV at Versailles, Colbert (the kneeling figure of his tomb at Saint-Eustache), Cardinal Mazarin (in the church of the Collège des Quatre-Nations), the Grand Condé (in the Louvre), Maria Theresa of Austria, Turenne, Vauban, Cardinals de Bouillon and de Polignac, the duc de Chaulnes (National Gallery of Art, Washington); Fénelon, Racine, André Le Nôtre (church of St-Roch); Bossuet (in the Louvre), the comte d'Harcourt, William Egon Cardinal Fürstenberg as well as Charles Le Brun (in the Louvre).  Coysevox died in Paris, 10 October 1720. Besides the works given above he carved about a dozen funeral monuments, including those to Colbert (at Saint-Eustache), to Cardinal Mazarin (in the Louvre), and to the painter Le Brun (in the church of Saint Nicholas-du-Chardon). Between 1708 and 1710 Coysevox produced three further sculptures for Marly, a ""Pan"" (now in the Louvre), flanked by a ""Flora"" and a ""Dryad"" (in the Tuileries Gardens). A highly-finished terracotta bozzetto or reduction of the ""Dryad"", signed and dated 1709, is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Among the pupils of Coysevox were Nicolas and Guillaume Coustou. "
wikipedia-3947876," Rundu  Rundu is the capital of the Kavango Region, northern Namibia, on the border with Angola on the banks of the Okavango River about 1000 m above sea level. The place normally receives an annual average rainfall of , although in the 2010/2011 rainy season were measured. Rundu is growing rapidly. The 2001 census counted 36,964 inhabitants; for 2010 it is estimated to have grown to over 80,000 people. History. In 1936 it became seat of the local governor and replaced Nkurenkuru as capital of the Kavango district. The town has since grown into a multilingual city of the Kavango region, but its official status is still that of a village. Geography. Localities. The oldest houses in Rundu are located in the Katutura area. These houses are mainly 2 bedroom homes with large backyards even though they are situated next to the CBD. On the west is Tutungeni, which means ""let's build"". This area was previously occupied by executives of the white-dominated businessplace, but now it is open for any willing buyer in need of a quiet neighbourhood. On the East is Safari. There are the middle-priced houses and were built in the 1970s. These three main localities dominated Rundu residential life until the turn of the millennium in 2000, when new housing projects by O'B Davids Properties built a new residential area named Millennium Park. After which two others have been built by the NHE, Queens and Kings Parks respectively. Climate. Rundu has a humid subtropical climate (""Cwa"", according to the Köppen climate classification), with hot summers and relatively mild winters (with warm days and chilly to cool nights). It borders on a semi-arid climate (""BSh""). The average annual precipitation is .  Culture. Rundu is home to many woodcarvers and features a woodcarver's market near the open market. Several local restaurants serve traditional food, including mahangu, ground nuts, stewed meats, and fish from the Okavango River. One such restaurant is Kalimba Home Restaurant  Informal housing. Outside the formal suburbs shanty towns symbolise the rapid urbanisation of the town and high unemployment rates. Kehemu, Sauyemwa and Ndama are the most informal areas while a fourth, Donkerhoek (Dark Corner) is rapidly becoming formal since the start of the Build Together Campaign in 1992. Infrastructure. Rundu Airport, mostly used for tourism and cargo, is 5 km southeast of the town.  The Rundu State Hospital is situated in the center of the town, off Markus Siwarongo street. It's the largest hospital in Kavango. Schools. There are four tertiary Institutions in Rundu, namely Rundu College of Education, Rundu Vocational Training Centre, Namibia College of Open Learning (NAMCOL) and Triumphant College. The University of Namibia and Polytechnic of Namibia both maintain centres that provide support for students who are studying on distance. There are six secondary schools in the town: Rundu Secondary School, Dr. Alpo Mbamba Secondary School, Dr. Romanus Kampungu Secondary School, Elias Neromba Senior Secondary School, Noordgrens, and Kamunoko Secondary School. Rundu Open Market. Rundu Open Market is the most well-known and biggest open market in the town. It was founded in 1996 through cooperation between the government of Namibia and the government of Luxembourg. "
wikipedia-309664," Fog of war  The fog of war is the uncertainty in situational awareness experienced by participants in military operations. The term seeks to capture the uncertainty regarding one's own capability, adversary capability, and adversary intent during an engagement, operation, or campaign.  Origin. The concept was introduced by the Prussian military analyst Carl von Clausewitz in his posthumously published book, ""Vom Kriege"" (1837), which appeared in English translation in 1873 under the title ""On War"": Levels. The nature of the ambiguity described as the fog of war varies according to the level at which participants are engaged. Grand strategic. Ambiguity is related to the political intent, capabilities, and logistical strengths of an adversary. Sources of information include diplomatic intelligence, secret (or special) intelligence, strategic modeling, and data derived from open-source intelligence. Affected participants seek to understand intent of and political motivations. Outcomes at this level may encompass military action but are more concerned with sociopolitical and economic outcomes from which it might cascade if left unattended. Military strategic. Militarily, the ambiguity experienced at this level relates to the structure, strength, capability, and disposition of own and adversary offensive and defensive assets. Own-force ambiguity can be caused by failure to report material deficiencies or an unwillingness to escalate concerns, leading to an optimistic view of own capabilities. Adversary ambiguity may be a result of inaccurate intelligence, sources being subverted or deceived, or adversary intelligence presenting a superior picture allowing one's decision cycle to be compromised. In addition, if unanticipated situations occur they can hamper the execution of long term planning. Operational. Within the operational theatre the commander undertakes tasks as directed by the Military Strategic level, ambiguity continues to relate to adversary capability and intent but is coupled with own directive ambiguity, the commander not having the full sight of the strategic imperative. As operational tempo increases at this level the ambiguity experienced by the commander is susceptible to delays in communication of the tactical situation and the ebb and flow of own force, and adversary force interaction. The commander seeks to penetrate the fog of war through significant use of reconnaissance assets and a comprehensive Joint Operational Picture. Tactical. Ambiguity stems from several factors at the tactical level, both by deliberate means by the enemy (including active deception and/or electronic attack on communications and sensors) as well as factors inherent to battle resulting in lack of comprehension by commanders as to the tactical environment, the logistic status of their own units, how they are interacting with each other, or their intentions. This lack of comprehension can stem from many factors, individually or in combination, such as poor reconnaissance; inaccurate intelligence; or faulty communication. The tempo of decision making at the tactical level is much greater than at other levels, increasing the risk of escalating ambiguity as assumptions build and resources are allocated based on those assumptions. Experience. The practical experience of the ""fog of war"" is most easily demonstrated in the tactical battlespace. It may include military commanders' incomplete or inaccurate intelligence about the enemy's numbers, disposition, capabilities, and intent, regarding features of the battlefield, and incomplete knowledge of the state of their own forces. Fog of war is caused by the limits of reconnaissance, by the enemy's feints and disinformation, by delays in receiving intelligence and difficulties passing orders, and by the difficult task of forming a cogent picture from a very large (or very small) amount of diverse data. When a force engages in battle and the urgency for good intelligence increases, so does the fog of war and chaos of the battlefield, while military units become preoccupied with fighting or are lost (either destroyed by enemy fire or literally lose their way), reconnaissance and liaison elements become unavailable, the minimum distance for effective communication increases, and sometimes real fog and smoke obscure vision (hence obscuring communication). Much of the modern military's technological efforts, under the rubric of command and control seek to reduce the fog of war. Although even the most advanced technology cannot eliminate it, military theorists continue to develop ways to reduce it. Simulations and games. Abstract and military board games sometimes try to capture the effect of the fog of war by hiding the identity of playing pieces, by keeping them face down or turned away from the opposing player (as in ""Stratego"") or covered (as in ""Squad Leader""). Other games, such as the ""Kriegspiel"" chess-variant, playing pieces are hidden from the opponent by tracking them on paper or by using a duplicate, hidden game board. Solitaire games also by their nature attempt to recreate fog of war using random dice rolls, card draws, or flowcharts to determine events, for example ""Ambush!"". Complex double-blind miniatures wargames, including cloth model training exercises for military commanders, may make use of two identical maps or model landscapes, one or more referees providing limited intelligence to the opposing sides, participants in the roles of sub-unit leaders, and the use of radio sets or intercoms. The term ""fog of war"" has become jargon in military and adventure video and computer games, in the more limited sense of enemy units or characters being hidden from the player. Often this is done by obscuring sections of the map already explored by the player with a grey fog whenever they do not have a unit in that area to report on what is there. The player can still view the terrain but not any enemy units on it. One early use of fog of war was the 1978 game ""Tanktics"" designed by Chris Crawford, which was criticized for its fog of war system detracting from the fun of the game. Crawford later noted that ""when the games get too realistic, they lose their appeal"". Two of the most successful Blizzard franchises, ""Warcraft"" and ""StarCraft"", also use a similar fog of war which only reveals terrain features and enemy units through a player's reconnaissance. Without a unit actively observing, previously revealed areas of the map are subject to a shroud through which only terrain is visible, but not changes in enemy units or bases. ""Total Annihilation"" and ""Supreme Commander"" are two examples where the use of radar is crucial to detecting units within the fog of war. EA Games' ""Command & Conquer"" franchise has incorporated a similar fog of war through the series, as has Activision's '; the same type of effect is present in EA Games' Genie Engine which powers games including ""Age of Empires"" and '. Similarly, in ""Classic Empire"" video game, a player can only observe an enemy unit if it is in the vicinity of one of the player's units or cities. In some games, such as """", it is possible for the player to artificially recreate a fog of war against his opponent. In turn-based strategy games of the ""Advance Wars"", ""Field Commander"" and ""Fire Emblem"" series, ""Fog of War"" refers to a fog which shrouds the most part of a map. Sid Meier's turn-based franchise ""Civilization"" and its spin-off ""Alpha Centauri"" obscure parts of the map not occupied by the player or allies until the advent of orbital flight is reached by the player. By extension, ""fog of war"" is also used to describe the limited view distance of first-person shooters, where unlimited view is either considered bad for gameplay or, more often, used because of technical limitations, in that a fog of war allows for the rendering of a smaller part of the game area. In the ""Commands & Colors"" series of boardgames, designed by Richard Borg, the fog of war is simulated by a deck of cards from which the players can pick their actions. Different sides of the battle usually have a different number of cards (each one describing a possible action) and players have to choose which card to use. It often happens that the best action imaginable in that moment is impossible to do because the player does not have a useful card for it. This is to simulate the difficulty of in-battle communication in the heat of the moment. "
wikipedia-429349," Pratt & Whitney JT8D  The Pratt & Whitney JT8D is a low-bypass (0.96 to 1) turbofan engine, introduced by Pratt & Whitney in February 1963 with the inaugural flight of Boeing's 727. It was a modification of the Pratt & Whitney J52 turbojet engine, which powered the US Navy A-6 Intruder attack aircraft. The Volvo RM8 is an afterburning version that was license-built in Sweden for the Saab 37 Viggen fighter. A ""fixed"" version for powerplant and ship propulsion is known as the FT12. Design. The JT8D is an axial-flow front turbofan engine incorporating dual-spool design. There are two coaxially-mounted independent rotating assemblies: one rotating assembly for the low pressure compressor (LPC) which consists of the first six stages (i.e. six pairs of rotating and stator blades, including the first two stages which are for the bypass turbofan), driven by the second (downstream) turbine (which consists of three stages); and a second rotating assembly for the high-pressure compressor (HPC) section, which has seven stages. The high-pressure compressor is driven by the first (upstream) turbine, which has a single stage. The front-mounted bypass fan has two stages. The annular discharge duct for the bypass fan runs along the full length of the engine, so that both the fan air and exhaust gases can exit through the same nozzle. This arrangement allows some noise attenuation, in that the still-hot fast-moving turbine exhaust is shrouded in much-cooler and slower-moving air (from the bypass fan) before interacting with ambient air. Thus the JT8D noise levels were significantly reduced from previous non-turbofan engines, although the low bypass ratio meant that, compared to subsequently developed turbofans, high noise levels were still produced. Eight models comprise the JT8D standard engine family, covering the thrust range from 12,250 to 17,400 pounds-force (62 to 77 kN) and power 727, 737-100/200, and DC-9 aircraft. More than 14,000 JT8D engines have been produced, totaling more than one-half billion hours of service with more than 350 operators making it the most popular of all low-bypass turbofan engines ever produced. Within the fan inlet case, there are anti-icing air bosses and probes to sense the inlet pressure and temperature. Similar units exist throughout the engine to check temperatures and pressures. At the 13th (i.e. the final) compressor stage, air is bled out and used for anti-icing. The amount is controlled by the Pressure Ratio Bleed Control sense signal (PRBC). The ""diffuser case"" at the aft end of the compressor houses the 13th stage. Its increasing cross-sectional area allows the compressed air to slow down before entering one of the engine's nine burner cans. Again, there are two bosses to extract 13th stage air for anti-icing, de-icing of fuel, and airframe (cabin pressurization) use. Not all the compressed air enters the burner cans at the fuel-ignition point; some bypasses the can completely and cools the first turbine stage, and some is gradually introduced into the burner can's perimeter in such a way that the burning fuel is held near the can's centerline. There are nine combustion chambers positioned in a can-annular arrangement. Each chamber has three air inlet hole sizes: the smallest is for cooling, the medium is for burning and the large for forming an air blanket. Update programs. In response to environmental concerns that began in the 1970s, the company began developing a new version of the engine, the JT8D-200 series. Designed to be quieter, cleaner, more efficient, yet more powerful than earlier models, the -200 Series power-plant was re-engineered with a significantly higher bypass ratio (1.74 to 1) covering the 18,500 to 21,700 pound-force (82 to 97 kN) thrust range and powering the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series. This increase was achieved by increasing bypass fan diameter (from 39.9 to 49.2 inches) and reducing fan pressure ratio (from 2.21 to 1.92). Overall engine pressure ratio was also increased from 15.4 to 21.0. Since entering service in 1980, more than 2,900 of the -200 series engines have been produced. The JT8D-217 and -219 engine(s) were tested in 2001 and were deemed suitable replacements for the old TF33 engines on military and commercial aircraft as part of the Super 27 re-engining program. The updated engines offer reduced (Stage-3) noise compliance standards without the need for hush kits, enhanced short field performance, steeper and faster climb rates with roughly a 10% reduction in fuel burn for extended range. Pratt & Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS) and Omega Air, has developed the JT8D-219 as a re-engine powerplant for Boeing 707-based aircraft. Northrop Grumman uses the -219 to re-engine the United States Air Force’s fleet of 19 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (E-8 Joint STARS) aircraft, which will allow the JSTARS more time on station due to the engine's 17% greater fuel efficiency. NATO also plans to re-engine their fleet of E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The -219 is publicized as being half the cost of the competing 707 re-engine powerplant, the CFM-56, for reasons of geometrical and balance similarity to the engine it is replacing and the associated relative up-front wing modification costs of the two choices. There have been discussions of using the engine, among other engine choices, for the B-52H, which is programmed for use until 2040. The proposed Aerion business jet, currently under development, is being designed to use a pair of JT8D-219 engines for sustained supersonic flight.  Variants.

wikipedia-549895," Rhabdomyosarcoma  A rhabdomyosarcoma, commonly referred to as RMS, is a type of cancer, specifically a sarcoma (cancer of connective tissues), in which the cancer cells are thought to arise from skeletal muscle progenitors. It can also be found attached to muscle tissue, wrapped around intestines, or in any anatomic location. Most occur in areas naturally lacking in skeletal muscle, such as the head, neck, and genitourinary tract. Presentation. Its two most common forms are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. In the former, which is more common in younger children, the cancer cells resemble those of a typical 6-to-8-week embryo. In the latter, which is more common in older children and teenagers, they resemble those of a typical 10-to-12-week embryo. Epidemiology. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a relatively rare form of cancer. When RMS does occur, it is most commonly seen in children aged one to five years old. Less commonly, it can also present in teens aged 15 to 19, and can even develop in adulthood, though this is even more rare. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital reports that Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Soft tissue sarcomas make up about 3% of childhood cancers. Diagnosis. The diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma is made by a pathologist; he or she will examine a biopsy of the tumor under the microscope and arrive at the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma based on the morphology (appearance) of the tumor cells and the results of immunohistochemical stains. Diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma depends on recognition of differentiation toward skeletal muscle cells. The proteins ""myoD1"" and ""myogenin"" are transcription factor proteins normally found in developing skeletal muscle cells which disappears after the muscle matures and becomes innervated by a nerve. Thus, myoD1 and myogenin are not usually found in normal skeletal muscle and serve as a useful immunohistochemical marker of rhabdomyosarcoma. Early manifestation can be misdiagnosed as a pseudotumor that is non responsive to steroid treatment. Classification. Several different histological subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma exist, each of which has different clinical and pathological characteristics. Prognosis and clinical behavior of the tumor is also partially dependent on histologic subtype. Multiple classification systems have been proposed for subclassifying these tumors. The most recent classification system, the ""International Classification of Rhabdomyosarcoma"", was created by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study. This system attempts to combined elements of the previous systems and correlate these with prognosis based on tumor type. International Classification of Rhabdomyosarcoma  Several additional subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma exist that do not fit into the International Classification scheme. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma usually occurs in adults rather than children, and, thus, is not included in this system. Sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare rhabdomyosarcoma subtype recently characterized by Folpe, ""et al.""; it is not included in this system. Although botryoid and spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma are classically considered as subtypes of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, they have more favorable clinical behavior and prognosis than classic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Treatment. Treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma consists of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and sometimes surgery. Surgery to remove the tumor may be difficult or impossible depending on the location of the tumor. If there is no evidence of metastasis, surgery combined with chemotherapy and radiation offers the best prognosis. Patients whose tumors have not metastasized usually have a good chance for long-term survival, depending on the subtype of the tumor. St Jude's Children's Research Hospital reports that more than 70% of children diagnosed with localized rhabdomyosarcoma have long-term survival. Tungsten Alloy and RMS. A study has shown a link between RMS and Tungsten alloy embedded in muscle (e.g. bullet or missile fragments). Rhabdomyosarcoma in children has been associated with maternal marijuana smoking. "
wikipedia-98513," Carl Perkins  Carl Lee Perkins (April 9, 1932 – January 19, 1998) was an American rockabilly musician who recorded most notably at Sun Records Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, beginning during 1954. His best known song is ""Blue Suede Shoes"". According to Charlie Daniels, ""Carl Perkins' songs personified the rockabilly era, and Carl Perkins' sound personifies the rockabilly sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed."" Perkins' songs were recorded by artists (and friends) as influential as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Johnny Cash, which further cemented his place in the history of popular music. Paul McCartney even claimed that “If there were no Carl Perkins, there would be no Beatles”. Called ""the King of Rockabilly"", he was inducted into the Rock and Roll, the Rockabilly, and the Nashville Songwriters Halls of Fame; and was a Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipient. Biography. Early life. Perkins was the son of poor sharecroppers, Buck and Louise Perkins (misspelled on his birth certificate as ""Perkings"") near Tiptonville, Tennessee. He grew up hearing Southern gospel music sung by whites in church, and by black field workers when he started working in the cotton fields at age six. During spring and autumn, the school day would be followed by several hours of work in fields. During the summer, workdays were 12–14 hours, ""from can to can't."" Carl and his brother Jay together would earn 50 cents a day. With all family members working and not having any credit, there was enough money for beans and potatoes, some tobacco for Carl's father Buck, and occasionally the luxury of a five-cent bag of hard candy. During Saturday nights Carl would listen to the radio with his father and hear the ""Grand Ole Opry"", and Roy Acuff's broadcasts on the Opry inspired him to ask his parents for a guitar. Because they could not afford a real guitar, Carl's father fashioned one from a cigar box and a broomstick. When a neighbor in tough straits offered to sell his dented and scratched Gene Autry model guitar with worn-out strings, Buck purchased it for a couple of dollars. For the next year Carl taught himself parts of Acuff's ""Great Speckled Bird"" and ""The Wabash Cannonball"", which he had heard on the ""Opry"". He also cited the fast playing and vocals of Bill Monroe as an early influence. Carl began learning more about playing his guitar from a fellow field worker named John Westbrook who befriended him. ""Uncle John,"" as Carl called him, was an African American in his sixties who played blues and gospel on his battered acoustic guitar. Most famously, ""Uncle John"" advised Carl when playing the guitar to ""Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate."" Because Carl could not afford new strings when they broke, he retied them. The knots would cut into his fingers when he tried to slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of ""blue note."" Carl was recruited to be a member of the Lake County Fourth Grade Marching Band, and because of the Perkins's limited finances, was given a new white shirt, cotton pants, white band cap and red cape by Miss Lee McCutcheon, who was in charge of the band. In January 1947, Buck Perkins moved his family from Lake County, Tennessee to Madison County, Tennessee. A new radio that ran on house current rather than a battery and the proximity of Memphis made it possible for Carl to hear a greater variety of music. At age fourteen years, using the I IV V chord progression common to country songs of the day, he wrote what came to be known around Jackson as ""Let Me Take You To the Movie, Magg"" (the song would convince Sam Phillips to sign Perkins to his Sun Records label). Beginnings as a performer. Perkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers at the ""Cotton Boll"" tavern on Highway 45 some twelve miles south of Jackson, starting on Wednesday nights during late 1946. Carl was only 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an uptempo, country blues shuffle version of Bill Monroe's ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Carl drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern near the western boundary of Jackson. Both places were the scene of occasional fights, and both of the Perkins Brothers gained a reputation as fighters. During the next couple of years the Perkins Brothers began playing other taverns, including El Rancho, The Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop around Bemis and Jackson as they became well known. Carl persuaded his brother Clayton to play the bass fiddle to complete the sound of the band. Perkins began performing regularly on WTJS-AM in Jackson during the late 1940s as a sometime member of the Tennessee Ramblers. He also appeared on ""Hayloft Frolic"" where he performed two songs, sometimes including ""Talking Blues"" as done by Robert Lunn on the ""Grand Ole Opry"". Perkins and then his brothers began appearing on ""The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour"". Overwhelmingly positive listener response resulted in a 15-minute segment sponsored by Mother's Best Flour. By the end of the 1940s, the Perkins Brothers were the best-known band in the Jackson area. Perkins had day jobs during most of these early years, working first at picking cotton, then at Day's Dairy in Malesus, then at a mattress factory and in a battery plant. He then worked as a pan greaser for the Colonial Baking Company from 1951 through 1952. During January 1953, Perkins married a woman he had known for a number of years, Valda Crider. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part-time, Valda, who had her own job, encouraged Carl to begin working the taverns full-time. He began playing six nights a week. Late the same year he added W.S. ""Fluke"" Holland to the band as a drummer, who had not any previous experience as a musician but had a good sense of rhythm. Malcolm Yelvington remembered the Perkins brothers from 1953 when they played in Covington, Tennessee. He noted that Carl had a very unusual blues-like style all his own. By 1955 Carl had made tapes of his material with a borrowed tape recorder, and had sent them to companies such as Columbia and RCA with addresses such as ""Columbia Records, New York City."" ""I had sent tapes to RCA and Columbia and had never heard a thing from 'em."" During July 1954, Perkins and his wife heard a new release of ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" by Elvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black on the radio., and Valda told Carl that someone in Memphis understood what he was doing and he should go see him. Later, Presley told Perkins that he had traveled to Jackson and seen Perkins and his group playing at El Rancho. As ""Blue Moon of Kentucky faded out, Carl said, ""There's a man in Memphis who understands what we're doing. I need to go see him."" Years later fellow musician Gene Vincent told an interviewer that, rather than ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" being a ""new sound"", ""a lot of people were doing it before that, especially Carl Perkins."" Sun Records. Perkins successfully auditioned for Sam Phillips at Sun Records during early October 1954. ""Movie Magg"" and ""Turn Around"" were released on the Phillips-owned Flip label (151) March 19, 1955, with ""Turn Around"" becoming a regional success. With the song getting airplay across the South and Southwest, Perkins was booked to appear along with Elvis Presley at theaters in Marianna and West Memphis, Arkansas. Commenting on the audience reaction to both Presley and himself Perkins said, ""When I'd jump around they'd scream some, but they were gettin' ready for him. It was like TNT, man, it just exploded. All of a sudden the world was wrapped up in rock."" Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two were the next musicians to be added to the performances by Sun musicians. During the summer of 1955 there were junkets to Little Rock, Forrest City, Arkansas, Corinth and Tupelo, Mississippi. Again performing at El Rancho, the Perkins brothers were involved in an automobile accident. A friend, who had been driving, was pinned by the steering wheel. Perkins managed to drag him from the car, which had begun burning. Clayton had been thrown from the car, but was not injured seriously. Another Perkins's tune, ""Gone Gone Gone"", released in October 1955 by Sun, was also a regional success. It was ""a bounce blues in flavorsome combined country and r.&b. idioms"". It was backed by the more traditional ""Let The Juke Box Keep On Playing,"" complete with fiddle, ""Western Boogie"" bass line, steel guitar and weepy vocal. Commenting on Perkins's playing, Sam Phillips has been quoted as saying that, ""I knew that Carl could rock and in fact he told me right from the start that he had been playing that music before Elvis came out on record... I wanted to see whether this was someone who could revolutionize the country end of the business."" That same autumn, Perkins wrote ""Blue Suede Shoes"" after seeing a dancer get angry with his date for scuffing up his shoes. Several weeks later, on December 19, 1955, Perkins and his band recorded the song during a session at Sun Studio in Memphis. Phillips suggested changes to the lyrics (""Go, cat, go"") and the band changed the end of the song to a ""boogie vamp"". Presley left Sun for a larger opportunity with RCA in November, and on December 19, 1955, Phillips, who had begun recording Perkins in late 1954, told Perkins, ""Carl Perkins, you're my rockabilly cat now."" Released on January 1, 1956, ""Blue Suede Shoes"" was a massive chart success. In the United States, it scored No. 1 on ""Billboard"" magazine's country music charts (the only No. 1 success he would have) and No. 2 on ""Billboard's"" Best Sellers popular music chart. On March 17, Perkins became the first country artist to score No. 3 on the rhythm & blues charts. That night, Perkins performed the song during his television debut on ABC-TV's ""Ozark Jubilee"" (Presley performed it for the second time that same night on CBS-TV's ""Stage Show""; he'd first sung it on the program on February 11). In the United Kingdom, the song became a Top Ten success, scoring No. 10 on the British charts. It was the first record by a Sun label artist to sell a million copies. The B side, ""Honey Don't"", was covered by The Beatles, Wanda Jackson and (in the 1970s) T. Rex. John Lennon sang lead on the song when the Beatles performed it before it was given to Ringo Starr to sing. Lennon also performed the song on the ""Lost Lennon Tapes"". The accident. After playing a show in Norfolk, Virginia on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed to New York City for a March 24 appearance on NBC-TV's ""Perry Como Show"". Shortly before sunrise on March 22 on Route 13 between Dover and Woodside in Dover, Delaware, Stuart Pinkham (a.k.a. Richard Stuart and Poor Richard) assumed duties as driver. After hitting the back of a pickup truck, their car went into a ditch of water about a foot deep, and Perkins was lying face down in the water. Drummer Holland rolled Perkins over, saving him from drowning. He had suffered three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body in the crash. Perkins remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver of the pickup truck, Thomas Phillips, a 40-year old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel. Carl's brother Jay had a fractured neck along with severe internal injuries, later dying from these complications. On March 23, Bill Black, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana visited Perkins on their way to New York to appear with Presley the next day. D.J. Fontana recalled Perkins saying, ""Of all the people, I looked up and there you guys are. You looked like a bunch of angels coming to see me."" Black told him, ""Hey man, Elvis sends his love,"" and lit a cigarette for him, even though the patient in the next bed was in an oxygen tent. A week later, Perkins was given a telegram from Presley (which had arrived on March 23), wishing him a speedy recovery. Sam Philips had planned to surprise Perkins with a gold record on ""The Perry Como Show"". ""Shoes"" had already sold more than 500,000 copies by March 22. Now, while Carl recuperated from the accident, ""Blue Suede Shoes"" scored No. 1 on most popular, R&B, and country regional music charts. It also scored No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and country charts. Elvis Presley's ""Heartbreak Hotel"" scored number one on the pop and country charts, while ""Shoes"" did better than ""Heartbreak"" on the R&B charts. By mid-April, more than one million copies of ""Blue Suede Shoes"" had been sold. On April 3, while still recuperating in Jackson, Perkins would see Presley perform ""Blue Suede Shoes"" on his first ""Milton Berle Show"" appearance, which was his third performance of the song on national television. He also made references to it twice during an appearance on ""The Steve Allen Show"". Although his version became more famous than Perkins's, it only scored No. 20 on Billboard's popular music chart. Return to recording and touring. Perkins returned to live performances on April 21, 1956, beginning with an appearance in Beaumont, Texas, with the ""Big D Jamboree"" tour. Before resuming touring, Sam Phillips arranged a recording session at Sun with Ed Cisco filling in for the still- recuperating Jay. By mid-April, ""Dixie Fried"", ""Put Your Cat Clothes On"", ""Right String, Wrong Yo-Yo"", ""You Can't Make Love to Somebody"", ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"", and ""That Don't Move Me"" had been recorded.  Beginning during early summer, Perkins was paid $1,000 to play just two songs a night on the extended tour of ""Top Stars of '56."" Other performers on the tour were Chuck Berry and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. When Perkins and the group entered the stage in Columbia, South Carolina, he was appalled to see a teenager with a bleeding chin pressed against the stage by the crowd. During the first guitar intermission of ""Honey Don't"" they were waved off stage and into a vacant dressing room behind a double line of police officers. Perkins was quoted as saying, ""It was dangerous. Lot of kids got hurt. There was a lot of rioting going on, just crazy, man! The music drove 'em insane."" Appalled by what he had seen and experienced, Perkins left the tour. Appearing with Gene Vincent and Lillian Briggs in a ""rock 'n' roll show"", he helped pull 39,872 people to the Reading Fair in Pennsylvania on a Tuesday night in late September. A full grandstand and one thousand people who stood in a heavy rain to hear Perkins and Briggs at the Brockton Fair in Mass. Sun issued more Perkins songs in 1956: ""Boppin' the Blues""/""All Mama's Children"" (Sun 243), the B side co-written with Johnny Cash, ""Dixie Fried""/""I'm Sorry, I'm Not Sorry"" (Sun 249). ""Matchbox""/""Your True Love"" (Sun 261) came out in February 1957. ""Boppin' the Blues"" reached No. 47 on the ""Cashbox"" pop singles chart, No. 9 on the ""Billboard"" country and western chart, and No. 70 on the ""Billboard"" Top 100 chart. ""Matchbox"" is considered a rockabilly classic. The day it was recorded, Elvis Presley visited the studio. Along with Johnny Cash (who left early), Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Presley spent more than an hour singing gospel, country and rhythm-and-blues songs while a tape rolled. The casual session was called The Million Dollar Quartet by a local newspaper the next day, and it was eventually released on CD in 1990. On February 2, 1957, Perkins again appeared on ""Ozark Jubilee"", singing ""Matchbox"" and ""Blue Suede Shoes"". He also made at least two appearances on ""Town Hall Party"" in Compton, California in 1957 singing both songs. Those performances were included in the ""Western Ranch Dance Party"" series filmed and distributed by Screen Gems. He released ""That's Right"", co-written with Johnny Cash, backed with the ballad ""Forever Yours"", as Sun single 274 in August, 1957. Both sides failed to chart. The 1957 film ""Jamboree"" included a Perkins performance of ""Glad All Over"" (not to be confused with The Dave Clark Five song of the same name), that ran 1:55. ""Glad All Over"", written by Aaron Schroeder, Sid Tepper, and Roy Bennett, was released by Sun in January 1958. Life after Sun. During 1958, Perkins moved to Columbia Records where he recorded songs such as ""Jive After Five"", ""Rockin' Record Hop"", ""Levi Jacket (And a Long Tail Shirt)"", ""Pop, Let Me Have the Car"", ""Pink Pedal Pushers"", ""Any Way the Wind Blows"", ""Hambone"", ""Pointed Toe Shoes"", ""Sister Twister"", and ""L-O-V-E-V-I-L-L-E"". In 1959, he wrote the country and western song ""The Ballad of Boot Hill"" for Johnny Cash who released the song as part of an EP on Columbia Records. He performed often in The Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas during 1962 and 1963, and also in nine Midwestern states and a tour of Germany. During May 1964, Perkins toured England along with Chuck Berry. The Animals backed the two performers. On the last night of the tour, Perkins attended a party that turned out to be for him, and ended up sitting on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by The Beatles. Ringo Starr asked if he could record ""Honey Don't"". ""Man,"" answered Perkins, ""go ahead, have at it."" The Beatles would cover ""Matchbox"", ""Honey Don't"" and ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"" recorded by Perkins but adapted from a song originally recorded by Rex Griffin during 1936 with new music composed by Carl Perkins, a song with the same title also recorded by Roy Newman in 1938. The Beatles recorded two versions of ""Glad All Over"" in 1963. Another tour to Germany followed in the autumn. He released ""Big Bad Blues"" backed with ""Lonely Heart"" as a single on Brunswick Records with The Nashville Teens in June 1964. Although he had been trying to rehabilitate himself by drinking only beer (but large amounts of it), during 1968, while on tour with the Johnny Cash troupe, Perkins began a four-day drunk in Tulsa, Oklahoma, starting with a bottle of Early Times. Nevertheless, with the urging of Cash, he opened a show in San Diego, California, by playing four songs after seeing ""four or five of me in the mirror,"" and while being able to see ""nothin' but a blur."" After drinking yet another pint of Early Times, he passed out on the tour bus. By morning he started hallucinating ""big spiders, and dinosaurs, huge, and they were gonna step on me."" The bus was parked on a beach at the ocean. He was tempted by yet another pint of whiskey that he had hidden. He took the bottle with him onto the beach and fell on his knees and said, ""Lord... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in You. I sailed it into the Pacific... I got up, I knew I had done the right thing."" Perkins and Cash, who had his own problems with drugs, then gave each other support to refrain from their drug of choice. During 1968, Cash recorded the Perkins-written ""Daddy Sang Bass"" (which incorporates parts of the American standard ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"") and scored No. 1 on the country music charts for six weeks. Glen Campbell also covered the song, as did The Statler Brothers and Carl Story. ""Daddy Sang Bass"" was also a Country Music Association nominee for Song of the Year. Perkins also played lead guitar on the Cash smash single ""A Boy Named Sue"" which was No. 1 for five weeks on the country chart and No. 2 on the popular music chart. Perkins spent a decade in Cash's touring revue and appeared on ""The Johnny Cash Show."" He played ""Matchbox"" with Cash and Derek and the Dominoes. Cash also featured Perkins in rehearsal jamming with José Feliciano and Merle Travis. A Kraft Music Hall episode hosted by Cash on April 16, 1969 had Perkins singing his song ""Restless"". Country music fans may recognize The Statler Brothers' song, ""Flowers on the Wall"", which was also featured on the show. During February 1969, Perkins joined with Bob Dylan to write ""Champaign, Illinois"". Dylan was recording in Nashville from February 12 through February 21 for an album that would be titled ""Nashville Skyline"", and met Perkins when he appeared on ""The Johnny Cash Show"" on June 7. Dylan had written one verse of a song, but was stuck. After Perkins worked out a loping rhythm and improvised a verse ending lyric, Dylan said, ""Your song. Take it. Finish it."" The co-authored song was included in Perkins's 1969 album ""On Top"". Perkins was also united in 1969 by Columbia's Murray Krugman with a ""rockabilly"" group based in New York's Hudson Valley, the New Rhythm and Blues Quartet. Carl and NRBQ recorded ""Boppin' the Blues"" which featured the group backing him on songs like his staples ""Turn Around"" and ""Boppin' the Blues"" and included songs recorded separately by Perkins and NRBQ. One of his TV appearances with Cash was on the popular country series ""Hee Haw"" on February 16, 1974. Johnny Cash's brother Tommy Cash had a Top Ten country gospel hit in 1970 with a recording of the song ""Rise and Shine"" which was written by Carl Perkins. Tommy Cash reached no. 9 on the ""Billboard"" country chart and no. 8 on the Canadian country chart with his version of the song. Arlene Harden had a Top 40 country hit in 1971 with the Carl Perkins composition ""True Love Is Greater Than Friendship"" from the film ""Little Fauss and Big Halsy"" (1971) which reached no. 22 on the ""Billboard"" country chart and no. 33 on the ""Billboard"" Adult Contemporary chart for Al Martino that same year. After a long legal struggle with Sam Phillips over royalties, Perkins gained ownership of his songs during the 1970s. Later years. During 1981 Perkins recorded the song ""Get It"" with Paul McCartney, providing vocals and playing guitar with the former Beatle. This recording was included on the chart-topping album ""Tug Of War"" released in 1982. This track also comprised the B-side of the title track single in a slightly edited form. One source states that Perkins ""wrote the song with Paul McCartney."" The song ends with a fade-out of Perkins's impromptu laughter. The ""rockabilly"" revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. During 1985, he re-recorded ""Blue Suede Shoes"" with Lee Rocker and Jim Phantom of the Stray Cats, as part of the soundtrack for the movie, ""Porky's Revenge"". In October 1985, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Dave Edmunds, Lee Rocker, Rosanne Cash and Ringo Starr appeared with him on stage for a television special that was taped live at the Limehouse Studios in London called """". The show was later shown on Channel 4 on the 1st January 1986. Perkins performed 16 songs with 2 encores in an extraordinary performance. Perkins and his friends ended the session by singing his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears. The concert special was a memorable highlight of Perkins's later career and has been highly praised by fans for the spirited performances delivered by Perkins and his famous guests. The concert was released for DVD by Snapper Music in 2006.  Also during 1985, Perkins was inducted to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 1987, wider recognition of his contribution to music came with his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition, ""Blue Suede Shoes"" was chosen as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and as a Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipient. His pioneering contribution to the genre was also recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Perkins's only notable film performance as an actor was in John Landis' 1985 film ""Into the Night"", a cameo-laden film that includes a scene where characters played by Carl and David Bowie die at each other's hand. As a guitarist Perkins used: finger picking, imitations of the pedal steel guitar, right-handed damping (muffling strings near the bridge with the palm), arpeggios, advantageous use of open strings, single and double string bending (pushing strings across the neck to raise their pitch), chromaticism (using notes outside of the scale), country and blue licks, and tritone and other tonality clashing licks (short phrases that include notes from other keys and move in logical, often symmetric patterns). A rich vocabulary of chords including sixth and thirteenth chords, ninth and add nine chords, and suspensions, show up in rhythm parts and solos. Free use of syncopations, chord anticipations (arriving at a chord change before the other players, often by a 1/8 note) and crosspicking (repeating a three 1/8 note pattern so that an accent falls variously on the upbeat or downbeat) are also in his bag of tricks. During 1986, he returned to the Sun Studio in Memphis, joining Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison on the album ""Class of '55"". The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet jam session involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis in 1956. During 1989, Perkins co-wrote and played guitar on The Judds' No. 1 country success, ""Let Me Tell You About Love"". During 1989, Perkins also signed a record deal with Platinum Records LTD for an album with the title ""Friends, Family, and Legends"", featuring performances by Chet Atkins, Travis Tritt, Steve Wariner, Joan Jett and Charlie Daniels, along with Paul Shaffer and Will Lee. During 1992, during the production of this CD, Perkins developed throat cancer. He returned to Sun Studios to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player. The CD was called ""706 ReUNION"", released on Belle Meade Records, and featured D.J. Fontana, Marcus Van Storey and The Jordanaires. During 1993, Perkins performed with the Kentucky Headhunters in a music video remake, filmed in Glasgow, Kentucky, of his song ""Dixie Fried."" In 1994, Perkins teamed up with Duane Eddy and The Mavericks to contribute ""Matchbox"" to the AIDS benefit album ""Red Hot + Country"" produced by the Red Hot Organization. Perkins's last album, ""Go Cat Go!"", was released during 1996, and featured new collaborations with many of the above artists, as well as George Harrison, Paul Simon, John Fogerty, Tom Petty, and Bono. It was released by the independent label Dinosaur Records and distributed by BMG. His last major concert performance was the Music for Montserrat all-star charity concert at London's Royal Albert Hall on September 15, 1997. Perkins died four months later, on January 19, 1998 at the age of 65 at Jackson-Madison County Hospital in Jackson, Tennessee from throat cancer after suffering several strokes. Among mourners at the funeral at Lambuth University were George Harrison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Wynonna Judd, Garth Brooks, Nashville Agent Jim Dallas Crouch, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Perkins was interred at Ridgecrest Cemetery in Jackson. His widow, Valda deVere Perkins, died November 15, 2005 in Jackson. Children. Carl Perkins had one daughter and three sons, Debbie, Stan, Greg, and Steve. Legacy. A strong advocate for the prevention of child abuse, Carl Perkins worked with the Jackson Exchange Club to establish the first center for the prevention of child abuse in Tennessee and the fourth in the nation. Proceeds from a concert planned by Perkins were combined with a grant from the National Exchange Club to establish the Prevention of Child Abuse in October 1981. For years its annual Circle of Hope Telethon generated one quarter of the center's annual operating budget. Perkins collaborated on a 1996 biography, ""Go, Cat, Go"", with New York–based music writer David McGee. Plans for a biographical film were announced by Santa Monica-based production company Fastlane Entertainment. was slated for release in 2009. During 2004, ""Rolling Stone"" ranked Perkins number 99 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. His version of ""Blue Suede Shoes"" was included by the National Recording Preservation Board in the Library of Congress National Recording Registry in 2006. The Perkins family still owns his songs, which are administered by former Beatle Paul McCartney's company MPL Communications. Drive-By Truckers, on their album ""The Dirty South"", recorded ""Carl Perkins' Cadillac"" that has a history of the artist and his relationships. George Thorogood & the Destroyers covered ""Dixie Fried"" on their 1985 album, ""Maverick"". The Kentucky Headhunters also covered the song as did Keith de Groot on a 1968 album entitled ""No Introduction Necessary"" that featured Jimmy Page on lead guitar and John Paul Jones on bass. Ricky Nelson covered Perkins's ""Boppin' The Blues"" and ""Your True Love"" on his 1957 debut album ""Ricky"". Perkins was portrayed by Johnny Saint Holiday in the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk the Line"". Perkins's first-born son Stan Perkins is a recording artist as well. In 2010, Stan joined forces with Jerry Naylor to record a duet tribute to Carl, ""To Carl; Let it Vibrate."" Stan Perkins has been inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. "
wikipedia-3105015," Howard Georgi  Howard Mason Georgi III, born January 6, 1947 in San Bernardino, California, is Harvard College Professor and Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics at Harvard University. He is best known for early work in Grand Unification and gauge coupling unification within SU(5) and SO(10) groups (see Georgi-Glashow model). Georgi has for many years taught an advanced freshman physics course, ""Physics 16"" in the fall semester. He is also Director of Undergraduate Studies in Physics and has been Co-Master of Leverett House with his wife, Ann Blake Georgi, since 1998. He graduated from Harvard College in 1967 and obtained his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1971. He was Junior Fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1973-1976 and a Senior Fellow from 1982-1998. In 1995 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and received the Sakurai Prize; in 2000 he shared the Dirac Medal with Jogesh Pati and Helen Quinn. He has advised a number of notable students, including Andrew G. Cohen, Adam Falk, Benjamin Grinstein, John Hagelin, Lawrence J. Hall, David B. Kaplan, Michael Luke, Aneesh Manohar, Ann Nelson, Brian Greene, Sally Dawson and Lisa Randall.  Georgi proposed an SU(5) GUT model with softly broken supersymmetry with Savas Dimopoulos in 1981. This paper is one of the foundational works for the supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). After the measurements of the three Standard Model gauge couplings at LEP I in 1991, it was shown that particle content of the MSSM, in contrast to the Standard Model alone, led to precision gauge coupling unification.  He has since worked on several different areas of physics including composite Higgs models, heavy quark effective theory, dimensional deconstruction, little Higgs, and unparticle theories. Unparticle physics is a theory that there exists matter that cannot be explained in terms of particles, because its components are scale invariant. Howard Georgi proposed this theory in the spring of 2007 in the papers ""Unparticle Physics"" and ""Another Odd Thing About Unparticle Physics"". Together with Vadim Alexeevich Kuzmin, Georgi received the Pomeranchuk Prize of the Alikhanov Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP) in 2006.  Georgi has published several books, the best known of which is ""Lie Algebras in Particle Physics"" published by World Scientific. He has also published ""The Physics of Waves"" and ""Weak Interactions and Modern Particle Theory"". "
wikipedia-152835," Debt  A debt is an obligation owed by one party (the debtor) to a second party, the creditor; usually this refers to assets granted by the creditor to the debtor, but the term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on economic value. A debt is created when a creditor agrees to lend a sum of assets to a debtor. Debt is usually granted with expected repayment; in modern society, in most cases, this includes repayment of the original sum, plus interest. In finance, debt is a means of using anticipated income and future purchasing power in the present before it has actually been earned. Some companies and corporations use debt as a part of their overall corporate finance strategy. Payment. Before a debt can be made, both the debtor and the creditor must agree on the manner in which the debt will be repaid, known as the standard of deferred payment. This payment is usually denominated as a sum of money in units of currency, but can sometimes be denominated in terms of goods or services. Payment can be made in increments over a period of time, or all at once at the end of the loan agreement. Types of debt. A company uses various kinds of debt to finance its operations. The various types of debt can generally be categorized into:1) secured and unsecured debt, 2) private and public debt, 3) syndicated and bilateral debt, and 4) other types of debt that display one or more of the characteristics noted above. A debt obligation is considered secured, if creditors have recourse to the assets of the company on a proprietary basis or otherwise ahead of general claims against the company. Unsecured debt comprises financial obligations, where creditors do not have recourse to the assets of the borrower to satisfy their claims. Private debt comprises bank-loan type obligations, whether senior or mezzanine. Public debt is a general definition covering all financial instruments that are freely tradeable on a public exchange or over the counter, with few if any restrictions. A basic loan or ""term loan"" is the simplest form of debt. It consists of an agreement to lend a fixed amount of money, called the principal sum or principal, for a fixed period of time, with this amount to be repaid by a certain date. In commercial loans interest, calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year, will also have to be paid by that date, or may be paid periodically in the interval, such as annually or monthly. Such loans are also colloquially called bullet loans, particularly if there is only a single payment at the end – the ""bullet"" – without a ""stream"" of interest payments during the life of the loan. There are many conventions on how interest is calculated – see day count convention for some – while a standard convention is the annual percentage rate (APR), widely used and required by regulation in the United States and United Kingdom, though there are different forms of APR. In some loans, the amount actually loaned to the debtor is less than the principal sum to be repaid; the additional principal has the same economic effect as a higher interest rate (see point), and is sometimes referred to as a banker's dozen, a play on ""baker's dozen"" – owe twelve (a dozen), receive a loan of eleven (a banker's dozen). Note that the effective interest rate is not equal to the discount: if one borrows $10 and must repay $11, then this is ($11–$10)/$10 = 10% interest; however, if one borrows $9 and must repay $10, then this is ($10–$9)/$9 = 11 1/9% interest. Rather than the entire principal amount of the loan being due at the end of the loan, the principal may be slowly repaid or ""amortized"" over the course of the loan – see amortizing loan. This is particularly common in mortgages and in the minimum payment on credit cards. A syndicated loan is a loan that is granted to companies that wish to borrow more money than any single lender is prepared to risk in a single loan, usually many millions of dollars. In such a case, a syndicate of banks can each agree to put forward a portion of the principal sum. Loan syndication is a risk management tool that allows the lead banks underwriting the debt to reduce their risk and free up lending capacity. A bond is a debt security issued by certain institutions such as companies and governments. A bond entitles the holder to repayment of the principal sum, plus interest. Bonds are issued to investors in a marketplace when an institution wishes to borrow money. Bonds have a fixed lifetime, usually a number of years; with long-term bonds, lasting over 30 years, being less common. At the end of the bond's life the money should be repaid in full. Interest may be added to the end payment, or can be paid in regular installments (known as coupons) during the life of the bond. Bonds may be traded in the bond markets, and are widely used as relatively safe investments in comparison to equity. Debt syndication. A syndicated loan is one that is provided by a group of lenders and is structured, arranged, and administered by one or several commercial banks or investment banks known as arrangers. Letters of credit. The Letter of Credit or LC can also be the source of payment for a transaction, meaning that redeeming the letter of credit will pay an exporter. Letters of credit are used primarily in international trade transactions of significant value, for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another. They are also used in the land development process to ensure that approved public facilities (streets, sidewalks, stormwater ponds, etc.) will be built. The parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money, the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client, and the advising bank of whom the beneficiary is a client. Almost all letters of credit are irrevocable, i.e., cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary, the issuing bank and the confirming bank, if any. In executing a transaction, letters of credit incorporate functions common to giros and Traveler's cheques. Typically, the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a commercial invoice, bill of lading, and a document proving the shipment was insured against loss or damage in transit. However, the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin. Accounting debt. In national accounting, debts are added according to those who are indebted. Household debt is the debt held by households. ""National"" or public debt is the debt held by the various governmental institutions (federal government, states, cities ...). Business debt is the debt held by businesses. Financial debt is the debt held by the financial sector (from one financial institution to another). Total debt is the sum of all those debts, excluding financial debt to prevent double accounting. These various types of debt can be computed in debt/GDP ratios. Those ratios help to assess the speed of variations in the indebtedness and the size of the debt due. For example, the U.S. has a high consumer debt and a low public debt, while in eastern European countries the opposite tends to be true. There are differences in the accounting of debt for private and public agents. If a private agent promises to pay something later, it has a debt, and this debt is enforceable by public agents. If a public body passes a law stating that it will pay something later (a kind of promise), it has the ability to change the law later (and not to pay). This is why, for instance, the money governments promised to pay for retirements does not show up in the public debt assessment, whereas the money private companies promised to pay for retirements does. Securitization. Securitization occurs when a company groups together assets or receivables and sells them in units to the market through a trust. Any asset with a cashflow can be securitized. The cash flows from these receivables are used to pay the holders of these units. Companies often do this in order to remove these assets from their balance sheets and monetize an asset. Although these assets are ""removed"" from the balance sheet and are supposed to be the responsibility of the trust, that does not end the company's involvement. Often the company maintains a special interest in the trust which is called an ""interest only strip"" or ""first loss piece"". Any payments from the trust must be made to regular investors in precedence to this interest. This protects investors from a degree of risk, making the securitization more attractive. The aforementioned brings into question whether the assets are truly off-balance-sheet given the company's exposure to losses on this interest. Inflation and exchange rates. As noted below, debt is normally denominated in a particular monetary currency, and so changes in the valuation of that currency can change the effective size of the debt. This can happen due to inflation or deflation, so it can happen even though the borrower and the lender are using the same currency. Thus it is important to agree on standards of deferred payment in advance, so that a degree of fluctuation will also be agreed as acceptable. It is for instance common to agree to ""US dollar denominated"" debt. The form of debt involved in banking accounts for a large proportion of the money in most industrialized nations (see money, broad money, and demand deposits for a discussion of this). There is therefore a relationship between inflation, deflation, the money supply, and debt. The store of value represented by the entire economy of the industrialized nation, and the state's ability to levy tax on it, acts to the foreign holder of debt as a guarantee of repayment, since industrial goods are in high demand in many places worldwide. Inflation indexed debt. Borrowing and repayment arrangements linked to inflation-indexed units of account are possible and are used in some countries. For example, the US government issues two types of inflation-indexed bonds, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds. These are one of the safest forms of investment available, since the only major source of risk – that of inflation – is eliminated. A number of other governments issue similar bonds, and some did so for many years before the US government. In countries with consistently high inflation, ordinary borrowings at banks may also be inflation indexed. Metrics and functions. Risk free interest rates. Lendings to stable financial entities such as large companies or governments are often termed ""risk free"" or ""low risk"" and made at a so-called ""risk-free interest rate"". This is because the debt and interest are highly unlikely to be defaulted. A good example of such risk-free interest is a US Treasury security – it yields the minimum return available in economics, but investors have the comfort of the (almost) certain expectation that the US Treasury will not default on its debt instruments. A risk-free rate is also commonly used in setting floating interest rates, which are usually calculated as the risk-free interest rate plus a bonus to the creditor based on the creditworthiness of the debtor (in other words, the risk of him or her defaulting and the creditor losing the debt). In reality, no lending is truly risk free, but borrowers at the ""risk free"" rate are considered the least likely to default. However, if the real value of a currency changes during the term of the debt, the purchasing power of the money repaid may vary considerably from that which was expected at the commencement of the loan. So from a practical investment point of view, there is still considerable risk attached to ""risk free"" or ""low risk"" lendings. The real value of the money may have changed due to inflation, or, in the case of a foreign investment, due to exchange rate fluctuations. The Bank for International Settlements is an organisation of central banks that sets rules to define how much capital banks have to hold against the loans they give out. Ratings and creditworthiness. Specific bond debts owed by both governments and private corporations are rated by rating agencies, such as Moody's, Fitch Ratings Inc., A. M. Best and Standard & Poor's. The government or company itself will also be given its own separate rating. These agencies assess the ability of the debtor to honor his obligations and accordingly give him or her a credit rating. Moody's uses the letters ""Aaa Aa A Baa Ba B Caa Ca C"", where ratings ""Aa-Caa"" are qualified by numbers 1-3. Munich Re, for example, currently is rated ""Aa3"" (). S&P and other rating agencies have slightly different systems using capital letters and +/- qualifiers. A change in ratings can strongly affect a company, since its cost of refinancing depends on its creditworthiness. Bonds below Baa/BBB (Moody's/S&P) are considered junk- or high risk bonds. Their high risk of default (approximately 1.6% for Ba) is compensated by higher interest payments. Bad Debt is a loan that can not (partially or fully) be repaid by the debtor. The debtor is said to default on his debt. These types of debt are frequently repackaged and sold below face value. Buying junk bonds is seen as a risky but potentially profitable form of investment. Consolidation. Debt consolidation involves taking out one loan to pay off many others, i.e. combining multiple loans into a single loan. It is often done to secure a lower interest rate, secure a fixed interest rate, or for the convenience of servicing only one loan. Cancellation. Short of bankruptcy, it is rare that debts are wholly or partially relinquished. Traditions in some cultures demand that this be done on a regular (often annual) basis, in order to prevent systemic inequities between groups in society, or anyone becoming a specialist in holding debt and coercing repayment. An example is the Biblical Jubilee year, described in the Book of Leviticus. Under English law, when the creditor is deceived into relinquishing the debt, this is a crime under the Theft Act 1978. International Third World debt has reached the scale that many economists are convinced that debt cancellation is the only way to restore global equity in relations with the developing nations.  Effects of debt. Debt allows people and organizations to do things that they would otherwise not be able, or allowed, to do. Commonly, people in industrialised nations use it to purchase houses, cars and many other things too expensive to buy with cash on hand. Companies also use debt in many ways to leverage the investment made in their assets, ""leveraging"" the return on their equity. This leverage, the proportion of debt to equity, is considered important in determining the riskiness of an investment; the more debt per equity, the riskier. For both companies and individuals, this increased risk can lead to poor results, as the cost of servicing the debt can grow beyond the ability to pay due to either external events (income loss) or internal difficulties (poor management of resources). Excesses in debt accumulation have been blamed for exacerbating economic problems. For example, prior to the beginning of the Great Depression debt/GDP ratio was very high. Economic agents were heavily indebted. This excess of debt, equivalent to excessive expectations on future returns, accompanied asset bubbles on the stock markets. When expectations corrected, deflation and a credit crunch followed. Deflation effectively made debt more expensive and, as Fisher explained, this reinforced deflation again, because, in order to reduce their debt level, economic agents reduced their consumption and investment. The reduction in demand reduced business activity and caused further unemployment. In a more direct sense, more bankruptcies also occurred due both to increased debt cost caused by deflation and the reduced demand. It is possible for some organizations to enter into alternative types of borrowing and repayment arrangements which will not result in bankruptcy. For example, companies can sometimes convert debt that they owe into equity in themselves. In this case, the creditor hopes to regain something equivalent to the debt and interest in the form of dividends and capital gains of the borrower. The ""repayments"" are therefore proportional to what the borrower earns and so can not in themselves cause bankruptcy. Once debt is converted in this way, it is no longer known as debt. Etymology. The word comes from the French ""dette"" and ultimately Latin ""debere"" (to owe), from ""de habere"" (to have). The letter ""b"" in the word ""debt"" was reintroduced in the 18th century, possibly by Samuel Johnson in his Dictionary of 1755 – several other words that had existed without a ""b"" had them reinserted at around that time. History of debt. The anthropologist David Graeber argues in """" that trade starts with some sort of credit namely the promise to pay later for already handed over goods. Therefore credit and debt existed even before coins. Criticisms. Some argue against debt as an instrument and institution, on a personal, family, social, corporate and governmental level. Islam forbids lending with interest even today, while the Catholic Church allowed it from 1822 onwards, and the Torah states that all debts should be erased every 7 years and every 50 years (in the Jubilee year, as described in the Book of Leviticus). Debt will increase through time if it is not repaid faster than it grows through interest. This effect may be termed usury, while the term ""usury"" in other contexts refers only to an excessive rate of interest, in excess of a reasonable profit for the risk accepted. In international legal thought, Odious debt is debt that is incurred by a regime for purposes that do not serve the interest of the state. Such debts are thus considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state. In an economy with high interest rates, debt will be more costly to a business than more flexible dividends on equity investment. It may be easier for a struggling business to be financed through equity investment as it may be possible to avoid paying a dividend if times are hard. At the household level, debts can also have detrimental effects. In particular when households make spending decisions assuming income to increase, or remain stable, for the years to come. When households take on credit based on this assumption, life events can easily change indebtedness into over-indebtedness. Such life events include unexpected unemployment, relationship break-up, leaving the parental home, business failure, illness, or home repairs. Over-indebtedness has severe social consequences, such as, financial hardship, poor physical and mental health, family stress, stigma, difficulty obtaining employment, exclusion from basic financial services (European Commission, 2009), work accidents and industrial disease, a strain on social relations (Carpentier and Van den Bosch, 2008), absenteeism at work and lack of organisational commitment (Kim ""et al."", 2003), feeling of insecurity, and relational tensions. Levels and flows. Global debt underwriting grew 4.3% year-over-year to $5.19 trillion during 2004. It is expected to rise in the coming years if the spending habits of millions of people worldwide continue the way they do. "
wikipedia-10378124," United Nations Security Council Resolution 82  United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 was a measure adopted by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on June 25, 1950. The resolution demanded North Korea immediately end its invasion of South Korea, the catalyst for the beginning of the Korean War. The measure was adopted by a vote of 9 support, none opposed, and one abstention.  The Korean Peninsula had been divided between occupation forces of the United States and the Soviet Union since the end of World War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between the two Koreas. These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the newly formed United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government. The resolution called on the North to immediately halt its invasion and to move its troops back to the 38th parallel. Seen as a diplomatic victory for the United States, the resolution was completely ignored by North Korea. This brought the UN and the US to take further action, setting the state for massive international involvement and the expansion of the Korean War. Background. Division of Korea. At the end of World War II, the Korean Peninsula, which up to that point had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, was divided along the 38th Parallel. To the north, the Soviet Union (USSR) occupied the country, which established itself as a communist state, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under Kim Il Sung. To the south, the United States (US) occupied the country, establishing the Republic of Korea under an autocratic anti-communist leader, Syngman Rhee. As tensions rose between the US and the USSR, each government in Korea claimed it had sovereignty over the whole country. In the late-1947 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 112 established a temporary commission to monitor free elections in Korea. The UN had intended to reunify Korea under one government, but the UN commission was unable to enter North Korea. After observing elections in South Korea, the UN stated in General Assembly Resolution 195 on December 12, 1948, that the nation was to be established under one government as soon as possible, and the US and Soviet occupation forces there were to withdraw. As time went on, the North Korean government became more aggressive, and skirmishes between troops of the North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country. Outbreak of war. On the night of June 25, 1950, ten divisions of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000 men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of equipment, and was unprepared for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces overcame isolated resistance from the 38,000 South Korean soldiers on the frontier before it began moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion. The North Koreans were well on their way to South Korea's capital of Seoul within hours, forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south. News of the invasion quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on the invasion within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting at his home in Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and would not be able to hold back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict. Lie convened the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for its 473rd meeting at 14:00 June 25 in New York City, New York. He began the meeting with a detailed report from the UN Commission on Korea, explained the situation to the delegates, and insisted that the UN take action to restore peace in Korea. According to the UN Commission on Korea, the situation was assuming the character of full-scale warfare. Then, US diplomat Ernest A. Gross gave Muccio's report on the situation. The United States introduced a resolution stating that North Korea's invasion was a breach of peace in violation of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Gross requested that South Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Chang Myon, be present for the meeting, which was granted. The Yugoslavian delegate requested that a North Korean diplomat be present as well, but this request was not granted. North Korea was not a member of the UN and had no representation in the organization. Myon read a prepared statement calling the invasion a crime against humanity, and said that as the UN had played a major role in the founding of South Korea, it was their responsibility to help defend it from aggression. The UNSC debated the resolution and made amendments and revisions to its wording before passing it. The resolution. The resolution passed with 9 supports and no opposition. Supporting nations included the United States, the United Kingdom, Republic of China, France, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Norway and India. Ales Babbler, delegate from Yugoslavia, abstained from voting. The Soviet Union's delegate had boycotted all UN meetings because of procedural disagreements earlier in the year. Soviet ambassador to the United Nations Yakov Malik had been personally ordered not to attend the UNSC meetings by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin. Lie was a strong supporter of the resolution, as he saw the conflict as a challenge to the authority of the UN. Aftermath. The resolution was seen as a political victory for the United States, as it identified North Korea as the aggressor in the conflict. Earlier in the day, independent of the UN resolution, Truman had ordered the Joint Chiefs of Staff to contact US Army General of the Army Douglas Macarthur, who was in charge of US forces in the Far East. He ordered MacArthur to prepare ships for the evacuation of US citizens from Korea, and authorized him to send ammunition and supplies to Pusan to support South Korean forces in the Seoul-Kimpo area. These would be escorted by US military units. He instructed MacArthur to send a survey team into the country to assess the situation and determine how to aid South Korea. Truman also ordered the mobilization of the US Navy for movement into the region. The US delegation later contacted the Soviet delegation and sent a message requesting that the Kremlin use its influence over North Korea to compel it to comply with the resolution, but the Soviet Union denied the request. With the ineffectiveness of the resolution in de-escalating the conflict, the UNSC convened on June 27 to discuss further actions to take, resulting in United Nations Security Council Resolution 83, which recommended military intervention by other UN member nations to restore peace in Korea. Within days, ships and aircraft from several nations, as well as the first major formations of US troops, were moving to South Korea, setting the stage for a full-scale conflict. In a 2010 column, Colum Lynch of ""Foreign Policy"" magazine criticized the resolution as one of the ten worst UN resolutions in history. After the Soviet Union ended its boycott of the council, it used its veto power to block any further resolutions against North Korea. In response, Acheson introduced a new procedure to the UN General Assembly to allow a member state to bypass the UNSC and seek approval in the General Assembly, including recommendations on the use of force, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377. When this was passed, it allowed for open-ended General Assembly emergency special sessions to address threats to international peace and security for which the UNSC was unable to pass a resolution. Lynch wrote that the creation of this rule caused unintended negative consequences for the United States in 1997 when several Arab states began the Tenth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to address the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This session, convened as a way around a US veto, spanned 30 meetings over the next ten years, and has never formally been closed. "
wikipedia-8720568," Michael Beasley  Michael Paul Beasley, Jr. (born January 9, 1989) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Miami Heat of the NBA. He plays both forward positions, and shoots his jump shot left-handed, though he is also ambidextrous. Beasley played college basketball for Kansas State University for one year before declaring for the NBA draft on April 14, 2008. He is regarded as one of the greatest freshman college basketball players of the 2000s. High school career. While growing up, Beasley played for one of the country's most successful AAU youth teams at the time, the PG Jaguars. Beasley won multiple national championships with this team alongside future fellow blue-chip recruits Kevin Durant (Texas) and Chris Braswell (UNC Charlotte). Beasley later moved on to play AAU ball for DC Assault's 17 & Under team, playing alongside such players as former KSU teammate Ron Anderson, Nolan Smith (Duke), Chris Wright (Georgetown), Austin Freeman (Georgetown), and Julian Vaughn (Georgetown). Beasley attended a total of six high schools: Bowie High School in Bowie, Maryland, National Christian Academy in Fort Washington, Maryland, The Pendleton School in Bradenton, Florida, Riverdale Baptist School in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia, and Notre Dame Preparatory School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. As a high school senior he averaged 28 points and 16 rebounds per game. Beasley was named as a 2006 USA Men's U18 National Team member on June 26, 2006. Beasley averaged team highs of 13.8 ppg. and 8.3 rpg at the 2006 FIBA Americas U18 Championship for Men in San Antonio, Texas. He ranked fifth in rebounds per game (8.3 rpg) among all 2006 tournament leaders, and he ranks third all-time in the USA Men's U18 record book. He was named to the McDonald's All-American team. In the 2007 McDonald's All-American Boys Game he won the MVP with 23 points and 12 rebounds. Rivals.com rated Beasley No. 1 in the class of 2007 high school basketball prospects. College career. Beasley began his freshman year at Kansas State in the fall of 2007. In the 2007–2008 regular season, Beasley was one of the most dominant players in the country. His 26.2 points (third-leading) and nation-leading 12.4 rebounds were the most by a Big 12 player in any season. His 866 total points and 408 rebounds ranked third and second among all freshmen in NCAA history. He also led the nation in double-doubles (28), 40-point games (three), 30-point, 10-rebound games (13), and 20-point, 10-rebound games (22). His 28 double-doubles broke the freshman double-double record previously held by Carmelo Anthony who had 22 double-doubles in his only season at Syracuse in 2002–03. On February 23, 2008, Beasley scored a Big 12 record 44 points in a 86–92 loss at Baylor. (This mark has since been matched by Kansas State's Denis Clemente.) Beasley became known as an unstoppable force when shooting, finishing the season shooting 53.7 percent from the field (282 of 525). He also finished the season shooting 39.5 percent from 3-point range. Beasley holds 30 Kansas State career, single-season and freshman records as well as 17 Big 12 single-game and single-season marks. Beasley guided the Wildcats to a 20–10 record and a 10–6 Big 12 Conference record. Some of the key conference victories were a win at Oklahoma and, a home victory against Texas A&M, and a victory against then-unbeaten No. 2 Kansas, marking the first time in over four years that Kansas State defeated a Top 10 team at home (Kansas State beat No. 10 Texas, 58–48 on March 6, 2004), the first time K-State beat Kansas in Manhattan since 1983 and the first-ever victory against the Jayhawks in Bramlage Coliseum. The win partially backed up a boast he had made before the season about K-State's prospects against the Jayhawks: On March 1, 2008, his boast did not come true, as Kansas won the return match in Lawrence, 88–74 despite 39 points and 11 rebounds from Beasley. He matched a Big 12 record by equaling former Kansas player Drew Gooden's record for most double-doubles in a season (25). With his 33-point, 14-rebound effort against Colorado on March 4, he eclipsed Mitch Richmond's 20-year-old school single-season points record (768; 1987–88), while he broke the Big 12 record for double-doubles in a season with his 26th for the year. He is just the 27th player in NCAA Division I history to post 26 or more double-doubles in a season and the first since Utah's Andrew Bogut (26) did it in 2004–05. Awards and honors.

In his NBA Summer League debut on July 7, Beasley scored 28 points and grabbed 9 rebounds (and had 2 assists) in 23 minutes played. He was second in the league in rebound average, and tied for third in scoring average in the 2008 Summer League. During his first official practice with the Heat, he was accidentally hit in the chest with an unidentified teammate's elbow. He was evaluated and returned to the team a day later with chest bruising, but only participated in non-contact play. He had slightly cracked his sternum, and resumed contact drills 2 days after that. In his first preseason game, Beasley scored 16 points against the Detroit Pistons. He followed those performances with 21 points and 7 rebounds, 12 points and 11 rebounds, 14 points and 6 rebounds, 19 points and no rebounds, 14 points and 3 rebounds, and 19 points and 9 rebounds. On opening night of the 2008–09 regular season, Beasley scored 9 points in a loss against the New York Knicks. He posted double-digit point totals for the next nine straight games, including a season-high 25 points in a loss to Charlotte on November 1. After the Heat's first round exit from the 2009 playoffs, it was reported that Beasley, along with fellow rookie Mario Chalmers, had been fined multiple times throughout the season for violations of team policy. During the 2009–10 season he was a starter for the entire season. On February 19, 2010 he led the Heat to victory over the Memphis Grizzlies with a then career-high 30 points along with 8 rebounds. For the season, he averaged 14.8 points per game and 6.4 rebounds per game. In the Heat's first-round playoff series loss to Boston, those averages declined to 10.4 and 5.8, respectively. Minnesota Timberwolves (2010–2012). On July 12, 2010, Beasley was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for 2011 and 2014 second-round draft picks. Beasley was traded in order to clear salary cap space for Miami, allowing them to sign free agents LeBron James and Chris Bosh, as well as re-sign Dwyane Wade. On November 10, 2010, he led the Timberwolves to victory over the Sacramento Kings with a career-high 42 points along with 9 rebounds. He finished the season averaging 19.2 points per game which was ranked top 20 in the league. In the 2011-12 season, Beasley sprained his foot against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 6, 2012 which kept him out for 11 straight games. Shortly after he returned from injury, he led the Timberwolves to victory over the Houston Rockets with 34 points. Over the 2011-12 season, he averaged 11.5 points per game. Phoenix Suns (2012–2013). On July 20, 2012, Beasley signed a 3 year, $18 million contract with the Phoenix Suns.

Lon Babby, the Suns' president of basketball operations, said, ""We worked hard to devote ourselves to Michael’s success, but we have to maintain the standards to build a championship culture."" Back to the Heat (2013–present). On September 11, 2013, Beasley signed with the Miami Heat. Off court issues. On September 3, 2008, at the NBA's Rookie Transition Program, Beasley was involved in an incident along with fellow rookies Mario Chalmers and Darrell Arthur. Police responded to the hotel room of Chalmers and Arthur following a fire alarm at 2 am and claimed that the room smelled strongly of burning marijuana, but none was found and no charges were filed. Chalmers and Arthur were excused from the camp because of the incident and were later fined $20,000 each for missing the rookie camp, but were not fined or suspended for any drug-related violations. Both later denied any involvement with marijuana. Originally, ESPN reported that Beasley was also present in the room, but was not asked to leave camp. The story was later updated and any mention of Beasley was removed from the article. On September 18, 2008, Beasley was fined $50,000 by the league for his involvement in the incident after Pat Riley forced him to confess to league officials that he had slipped out the door when the police arrived. On August 24, 2009, Beasley reportedly checked into a Houston rehab center, just days after he posted pictures of himself on his Twitter page with what some have speculated to be marijuana in the background. It is unknown if the rehab was drug related; as a report states, he was receiving counseling for stress-related issues. On June 26, 2011, Beasley was driving in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka when he was pulled over by a policeman for speeding. The policeman noticed that the car smelled of a strong odor of marijuana. The officer allegedly found marijuana in a plastic bag under the front passenger seat. However, Beasley said the marijuana was not his, but belonged to a friend whom he had just dropped off. Beasley was consequently fined and ticketed. Later in 2011, Beasley was on a NYC streetball tour with good friend and all-star Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant. On August 4, 2011, Beasley was participating in a streetball game at Dyckman Park in the Inwood neighborhood of New York City. In the game Beasley played on the 914 team (Green Shirts) and Durant on Team Nike (Black Shirts). Beasley was being heckled throughout the game. Deciding he had enough while a member of the black team was shooting free throws, Beasley walked up to the heckling fan. They argued and exchanged words, then Beasley gave the fan the open hand, pushing his face away. On August 6, 2013, Beasley was arrested on suspicion of marijuana possession in Scottsdale, Arizona. According to police reports, narcotics were confiscated from Beasley's car after he was stopped for a traffic violation. That arrest was a factor in Beasley's official removal from the Suns a month later. Personal. Beasley's parents are Fatima Smith and Michael Beasley, Sr. He has two brothers, Leroy Ellison and Malik Smith, and two younger sisters, Mychaela Beasley and Tiffany Couch. His god-brother is NBA journeyman, DerMarr Johnson. He has a daughter Mikaiya, born in May 2009 and a son Michael III, born in November 2010. Beasley grew up with Kevin Durant and Nolan Smith, and remains friends with both players. "
wikipedia-1551874," Hickman line  A Hickman line is a central venous catheter most often used for the administration of chemotherapy or other medications, as well as for the withdrawal of blood for analysis. Some types are used mainly for the purpose of apheresis or dialysis. Hickman lines may remain in place for extended periods and are used when long-term intravenous access is needed. The insertion of a Hickman line is usually done under sedation or a general anesthetic by a radiologist or surgeon. It involves two incisions, one at the jugular vein or another nearby vein or groove, and one on the chest wall. At the former incision site (known as the ""entrance"" site), a tunnel is created from there through to the latter incision site (known as the ""exit"" site), and the catheter is pushed through this tunnel until it ""exits"" the latter incision site. The exit site is where the lumens are seen as coming out of the chest wall. The catheter at the entrance site area is then inserted back through the entrance site and advanced into the superior vena cava, preferably near the junction of it and the right atrium of the heart. The entrance site is sutured. The catheter at the exit site is secured by means of a ""cuff"" just under the skin at the exit site, and the lumens are held down otherwise by a sterile gauze or dressing centered on the exit site, which also serves the purpose of preventing potential contamination at the exit site. Throughout the procedure, ultrasound and X-rays are used to ascertain the positioning of the catheter. Long-term venous catheters became available in 1968, and the design was improved by Broviac ""et al."" in 1973. Hickman ""et al."", after whom the system is named, further modified the principles in 1979 with subcutaneous tunneling and a Dacron cuff that formed an infection barrier. Dr Robert O. Hickman was a pediatric nephrologist at the Seattle Children's Hospital. Potential complications of placement of such a line include hemorrhage and pneumothorax during insertion and thrombosis or infection at later stages. Patients with a Hickman line therefore require regular flushes of the catheter with heparin, in order to prevent the line becoming blocked by blood clots. Preventing contamination at the exit site and ensuring that the lumens are flushed frequently is especially important for oncology patients, as they may have become immunocompromised as a result of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Pyrexia (fever) is one of the symptoms of contamination. This symptom and others, including the observance of swelling or bleeding at the exit site, indicate the patient should seek medical attention as soon as possible. "
wikipedia-216613," Invisible Pink Unicorn  The Invisible Pink Unicorn (IPU) is the goddess of a parody religion used to satirize theistic beliefs, taking the form of a unicorn that is paradoxically both invisible and pink. She is a rhetorical illustration used by atheists and other religious skeptics as a contemporary version of Russell's teapot, sometimes mentioned in conjunction with the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The IPU is used to argue that supernatural beliefs are arbitrary by, for example, replacing the word ""God"" in any theistic statement with ""Invisible Pink Unicorn"". The mutually exclusive attributes of pinkness and invisibility, coupled with the inability to disprove the IPU's existence, satirize properties that some theists attribute to a theistic deity. History. The IPU seems to have become notable primarily through online culture: in addition to alt.atheism, where IPU still frequently comes up in discussions, there are now a number of web sites dedicated to her. The earliest documented reference to the IPU was on July 7, 1990 on the Usenet discussion group alt.atheism. Other sources concerning IPU state that she was ""revealed to us"" on alt.atheism. The concept was further developed by a group of college students from 1994 to 1995 on the ISCA Telnet-based BBS. The students created a manifesto that detailed a nonsensical (yet internally consistent) religion based on a multitude of invisible pink unicorns. It is from this document that the most famous quotation concerning IPUs originated: Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of great spiritual power. We know this because they are capable of being invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them. — Steve Eley Concepts. It is common when discussing the Invisible Pink Unicorn to point out that because she is invisible, no one can prove that she does not exist (or indeed that she is not pink). This is a parody of similar theistic claims about God—that God, as creator of the universe, is not subject to its laws and thus not physically detecting him tells us nothing about his existence or lack thereof. The Invisible Pink Unicorn is an illustration which attempts to demonstrate the absurdity of citing attributes and a lack of evidence as proof of a deity's existence. Her two defining attributes, invisibility and color (pink), are inconsistent and contradictory; this is part of the satire. The paradox of something being invisible yet having visible characteristics (e.g., color) is reflected in some East Asian cultures, wherein an ""invisible ""red"" string"" is said to connect people who have a shared or linked destiny. There are humorous mock debates amongst her ""followers"" concerning her other attributes, such as whether she is completely invisible, or invisible to most, but visible to those who have faith in her (bearing similarities to ""The Emperor's New Clothes""). Some arguments are quite elaborate and tortuous, satirizing the disputatiousness and intricacy of the theological debates that occur in many religions. The Invisible Pink Unicorn is also used to de-deify religious texts. The goal is to have the reader experience the text without heavily loaded concepts that many readers will associate with omnipotence, or will read with an unquestioned faith. It is argued that when someone re-reads the same text with all direct references to God replaced with the Invisible Pink Unicorn, the reader may see the text in a new and more critical way:  Similar concepts. In 1996, a unicorn that no one can see was adapted as a teaching device at Camp Quest, the first free-thought summer camp for children established in the United States, by Dr. L. Wilson. As reported years later in the July 21, 2006 ""Cincinnati Enquirer"", ""Campers must try to prove that imaginary unicorns—as a metaphor for God—don't exist."" Richard Dawkins alluded to unicorns in this connection in his 2006 book ""The God Delusion"", writing that ""Russell's teapot, of course, stands for an infinite number of things whose existence is conceivable and cannot be disproved. [...] A philosophical favorite is the invisible, intangible, inaudible unicorn."" In the essay ""The Dragon in my Garage"" from the book ""The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle In the Dark"", Carl Sagan uses the example of an invisible dragon breathing heatless fire that someone claims lives in his garage. The supposed dragon cannot be seen, heard, or sensed in any way, nor does it leave footprints. There is no reason to believe this purported dragon exists. Criticism. Mariano Grinbank, a Messianic Jewish apologist, argues that the Invisible Pink Unicorn fails the test of natural theology which, he states, implies that before ""matter began to exist: whatever caused it is immaterial, non-physical, without extension in space, or spirit."" Grinbank explains that ""since Pink Unicorns have a physical form which interacts with light in displaying a pinkish color they are not invisible but are visible. The physical nature of the pseudo-invisible Pink Unicorns means that they fail the natural theology/general revelation test for the same reasons as does the Flying Spaghetti Monster."" A study analyzing the Invisible Pink Unicorn concluded that the ""study’s findings suggest that the IPU critique of religion is mostly misdirected."" "
wikipedia-2801662," Strait of Gibraltar crossing  The Strait of Gibraltar crossing is a hypothetical bridge or tunnel spanning the Strait of Gibraltar that would connect Europe and Africa. The governments of Spain and Morocco appointed a joint committee Bridge. Several engineers have designed bridges on various alignments and with differing structural configurations. Professor T.Y. Lin’s proposal for a crossing between Point Oliveros and Point Cires featured deep piers, a length of , tall towers, and a span, more than twice the length of the current longest bridge span. In 2004, architect Eugene Tsui published his concept for a floating and submerged bridge, connected at a three-mile wide island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. In 2004, the Science Museum published an image of the proposed Gibraltar Straits road bridge. A bridge spanning the Strait of Gibraltar is described in futurist author Arthur C. Clarke's 1979 science fiction novel ""The Fountains of Paradise"". Tunnel. Various Gibraltar tunnels have been proposed. Spain first proposed a modern tunnel under the Strait of Gibraltar in 1930. A major problem arose when the engineers hired by the Spanish government discovered that the material under the Strait was extremely hard rock, making tunnelling impossible with the available technology. One engineering solution was to fix, using cables, a prefabricated concrete tunnel to the floor of the Strait. This tunnel would handle automotive and train traffic. Nothing came of this proposed solution. A 2008 geological study cast doubt on the tunnel's practicality. In March 2009, a contract was issued for a joint system linking the Moroccan ""Société Nationale d'Etudes du Détroit de Gibraltar"" (SNED) with its Spanish counterpart, ""Sociedad española de estudios para la comunicación fija a través del Estrecho de Gibraltar S.A"" (SECEGSA). A three-year study for a railway tunnel was announced in 2003. SNED and SECEGSA commissioned several sea-bed surveys. The Strait depth extends to on the shortest route, although it is only about 300 metres deep slightly further west, where the European and African plates meet. The shortest crossing is . The proposed route of is west of Tarifa and to the east of Tangier. The tunnel is likely to be about in all, and an additional rail line would be needed to link the Spanish end of the tunnel near Tarifa to Algeciras, where the current Talgo train-hotel service currently terminates. A report on the feasibility of the tunnel was presented to the EU in 2009. A further study of project is under development by a group of specialised consultants from SYSTRA, Amberg and COWI. Planning. In December 2003, Spain and Morocco agreed to explore the construction of an undersea rail tunnel to connect their rail systems. The tunnel would have linked Cape Malabata near Tangier with Punta Paloma west of Gibraltar. In late 2006, Lombardi Engineering Ltd, a Swiss engineering and design company, was retained to draft a design for a railway tunnel. According to the company, the main differences between the construction of this tunnel and that of the Channel Tunnel, linking France and Great Britain, are the depth of the sea and the geological conditions. The area under the Strait is less stable than that under the English Channel. An active major geologic fault, the Azores-Gibraltar Transform Fault, bisects the Strait, and severe earthquakes have occurred in the area. The presence of two deep Quaternary clay channels in the middle of the Strait makes construction complex, causing doubts about the feasibility of the project and proposals for an exploratory tunnel. It is projected to carry 9 million passengers in its first year of operation, expected to be 2025. No official figures about the cost of the project had been announced by 2007, but previous estimates exceeded five billion Euro. Technical aspect. The proposed rail tunnel's length is , deep, and its construction would take 15 years. An earlier plan was to link the two continents via the narrowest part of the strait, but this idea was dismissed as it is below sea level and the deepest undersea tunnel, the Eiksund Tunnel, is below sea level. The construction of terminals, such as the Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal and Eurotunnel Calais Terminal at either end of the Channel Tunnel, might be required for trans-shipment of road vehicles. "
wikipedia-2999649," Cynthia Myers  Cynthia Jeanette Myers (September 12, 1950 – November 4, 2011) was an American model, actress, and ""Playboy"" magazine's Playmate of the Month for the December 1968 issue. Family. Myers was raised by her mother Mary, her grandparents, and various aunts and uncles after her father was killed in a car accident when she was four years old. She had two siblings: sister Tana and brother Lance.  Career. Myers was the first ""Playboy"" Playmate born in the 1950s when she appeared in the magazine in December 1968. The pictures were shot in June 1968 when she was 17 years old, but it was Playboy's policy by that time to wait until a Playmate turned 18 before her pictures would be published.  Her pictorial was titled ""Wholly Toledo!"" because of Myers' hometown and large breasts. Her centerfold was photographed by Pompeo Posar, and quickly became a favorite of American troops in Vietnam. The centerfold appears in the 1987 film ""Hamburger Hill"" and in the 1989 film ""The Siege of Firebase Gloria"". According to Myers, she was 13 when her breasts began to develop to the size 39 DD they were when she appeared in ""Playboy"". After her magazine debut, Myers made frequent appearances on Hugh Hefner's ""Playboy After Dark"" TV series in 1969. She made an uncredited appearance in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" before taking the leading role of the sensitive bisexual rock and roll singer and bass player Casey Anderson in Russ Meyer's ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"". She followed this with a supporting role in the Western, ""Molly and Lawless John"" (1972).  In 1994, it became known that a nude photo of Myers (along with fellow playmates Angela Dorian, Reagan Wilson and Leslie Bianchini) was scanned and inserted into Apollo 12 Extra-vehicular activity astronaut cuff checklists by pranksters at NASA. In 2009, Myers became a spokeswoman for Schlitz Beer. Death. Myers died of lung cancer on November 4, 2011. "
wikipedia-586954," Sennar  Sennar ( """") is a town on the Blue Nile in Sudan and capital of the state of Sennar. For several centuries it was the capital of the Funj Kingdom of Sennar. It had an estimated population of 100,000 inhabitants in the early 19th century. The modern town lies 17 km SSE of the ruins of the ancient capital. It is located close to Sennar Dam, which spurred agricultural activity when it was created in 1925 for crop irrigation. The Sinnar Dam was designed, built and subsequently managed by the English engineer, Stephen ""Roy"" Sherlock. Today there are two towns bearing the name Sennar. Sennar Junction, the older one, which represents an actual continuation to the ancient Sennar, both in time and geographical location, the junction element came from the fact that many railways intersect there, it being in the heart of the country, which accompanied the invasion of Sudan during the British colonisation at the end of eighteenth century. The other is Sennar Al-Madeena (i.e. Sennar Town), 5 km ESE of the Junction, located beside the Sennar Dam. It was built over the ruins of a small village called Mok-waar which was notable in the former cultures of the tribes of African origins who lived there before the arrival of Arab tribes to the Sudan. The city is home to Sinnar University, established in 1977. "

wikipedia-1010250," Molar pregnancy  Molar pregnancy is an abnormal form of pregnancy in which a non-viable fertilized egg implants in the uterus and converts a normal pregnancy into an abnormal one (which will fail to come to term). A molar pregnancy is a gestational trophoblastic disease that grows into a mass in the uterus that has swollen chorionic villi. These villi grow in clusters that resemble grapes. A molar pregnancy can develop when an egg that is missing its nucleus is fertilized and that may or may not contain fetal tissue. It is characterized by the presence of a hydatidiform mole (or hydatid mole, mola hydatidosa). Molar pregnancies are categorized into partial and complete moles. Mole as used here simply indicates clump of growing tissue, or a 'growth'. A complete mole is caused by a single (90%) or two (10%) sperm combining with an egg which has lost its DNA (the sperm then reduplicates forming a ""complete"" 46 chromosome set) The genotype is typically 46,XX (diploid) due to subsequent mitosis of the fertilizing sperm, but can also be 46,XY (diploid). 46,YY (diploid) is not observed. In contrast, a partial mole occurs when an egg is fertilized by two sperm or by one sperm which reduplicates itself yielding the genotypes of 69,XXY (triploid) or 92,XXXY (tetraploid). Complete hydatidiform moles have a higher risk of developing into choriocarcinoma — a malignant tumor of trophoblast cells — than do partial moles. The etymology is derived from ""hydatisia"" (Greek ""a drop of water""), referring to the watery contents of the cysts, and ""mole"" (from Latin ""mola"" = millstone/false conception). The term, however, comes from the similar appearance of the cyst to a hydatid cyst in an Echinococcosis.  A hydatidiform mole conception may be categorized in medical terms as one type of non-induced (natural) ""missed abortion"" - referred to colloquially as a ""missed miscarriage"", because the pregnancy has become non-viable (miscarried) but was not immediately expelled (therefore was ""missed""). Natural history. A hydatidiform mole is a pregnancy/conceptus in which the placenta contains grapelike vesicles (small sacs) that are usually visible with the naked eye. The vesicles arise by distention of the chorionic villi by fluid. When inspected in the microscope, hyperplasia of the trophoblastic tissue is noted. If left untreated, a hydatidiform mole will almost always end as a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). Based on morphology, hydatidiform moles can be divided into two types: In ""complete moles"", all the chorionic villi are vesicular, and no sign of embryonic or fetal development is present. In ""partial moles"" some villi are vesicular, whereas others appear more normal, and embryonic/fetal development may be seen but the fetus is always malformed and is never viable. Hydatidiform moles are a common complication of pregnancy, occurring once in every 1000 pregnancies in the US, with much higher rates in Asia (e.g. up to one in 100 pregnancies in Indonesia). In rare cases a hydatidiform mole co-exists in the uterus with a normal, viable fetus. These cases are due to twinning. The uterus contains two conceptuses: one with an abnormal placenta and no viable fetus (the mole), and one with a normal placenta and a viable fetus. Under careful surveillance it is often possible for the woman to give birth to the normal child and to be cured of the mole. The etiology of this condition is not completely understood. Potential risk factors may include defects in the egg, abnormalities within the uterus, or nutritional deficiencies. Women under 20 or over 40 years of age have a higher risk. Other risk factors include diets low in protein, folic acid, and carotene. The diploid set of sperm-only DNA means that all chromosomes have sperm-patterned methylation suppression of genes. This leads to overgrowth of the syncytiotrophoblast whereas dual egg-patterned methylation leads to a devotion of resources to the embryo, with an underdeveloped syncytiotrophoblast. This is considered to be the result of evolutionary competition with male genes driving for high investment into the fetus versus female genes driving for resource restriction to maximise the number of children. Parental origin. In most complete moles, all nuclear genes are inherited from the father only (androgenesis). In approximately 80% of these androgenetic moles, the most probable mechanism is that an empty egg is fertilized by a single sperm, followed by a duplication of all chromosomes/genes (a process called ""endoreduplication""). In approximately 20% of complete moles, the most probable mechanism is that an empty egg is fertilised by two sperm. In both cases, the moles are diploid (i.e. there are two copies of every chromosome). In all these cases, the mitochondrial genes are inherited from the mother, as usual. Most partial moles are triploid (three chromosome sets). The nucleus contains one maternal set of genes and two paternal sets. The mechanism is usually the reduplication of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg.  In rare cases, hydatidiform moles are tetraploid (four chromosome sets) or have other chromosome abnormalities. A small percentage of hydatidiform moles have biparental diploid genomes, as in normal living persons; they have two sets of chromosomes, one inherited from each biological parent. Some of these moles occur in women who carry mutations in the gene ""NLRP7"", predisposing them towards molar pregnancy. These rare variants of hydatidiform mole may be complete or partial. Clinical presentation and diagnosis. Molar pregnancies usually present with painless vaginal bleeding in the fourth to fifth month of pregnancy. The uterus may be larger than expected, or the ovaries may be enlarged. There may also be more vomiting than would be expected (hyperemesis). Sometimes there is an increase in blood pressure along with protein in the urine. Blood tests will show very high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).  The diagnosis is strongly suggested by ultrasound (sonogram), but definitive diagnosis requires histopathological examination. On ultrasound, the mole resembles a bunch of grapes (""cluster of grapes"" or ""honeycombed uterus"" or ""snow-storm""). There is increased trophoblast proliferation and enlarging of the chorionic villi. Angiogenesis in the trophoblasts is impaired as well. Sometimes symptoms of hyperthyroidism are seen, due to the extremely high levels of hCG, which can mimic the normal Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Treatment. Hydatidiform moles should be treated by evacuating the uterus by uterine suction or by surgical curettage as soon as possible after diagnosis, in order to avoid the risks of choriocarcinoma. Patients are followed up until their serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) level has fallen to an undetectable level. Invasive or metastatic moles (cancer) may require chemotherapy and often respond well to methotrexate. As they contain paternal antigens, the response to treatment is nearly 100%. Patients are advised not to conceive for one year after a molar pregnancy. The chances of having another molar pregnancy are approximately 1%. Anesthesia Management: The uterine curettage is generally done under the effect of anesthesia, preferably spinal anesthesia in hemodynamically stable patients. The advantages of spinal anesthesia over general anesthesia include ease of technique, favorable effects on the pulmonary system, safety in patients with hyperthyroidism and non-tocolytic pharmacological properties. Additionally, by maintaining patient’s consciousness one can diagnose the complications like uterine perforation, cardiopulmonary distress and thyroid storm at an earlier stage than when the patient is sedated or is under general anesthesia.  Management is more complicated when the mole occurs together with one or more normal fetuses. Carboprost (PGF2α) medication may be used to contract the uterus. Prognosis. More than 80% of hydatidiform moles are benign. The outcome after treatment is usually excellent. Close follow-up is essential. Highly effective means of contraception are recommended to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 to 12 months. In 10 to 15% of cases, hydatidiform moles may develop into invasive moles. This condition is named ""persistent trophoblastic disease"" (PTD). The moles may intrude so far into the uterine wall that hemorrhage or other complications develop. It is for this reason that a post-operative full abdominal and chest x-ray will often be requested. In 2 to 3% of cases, hydatidiform moles may develop into choriocarcinoma, which is a malignant, rapidly-growing, and metastatic (spreading) form of cancer. Despite these factors which normally indicate a poor prognosis, the rate of cure after treatment with chemotherapy is high. Over 90% of women with malignant, non-spreading cancer are able to survive and retain their ability to conceive and bear children. In those with metastatic (spreading) cancer, remission remains at 75 to 85%, although their childbearing ability is usually lost. The prognosis of hydatidiform moles can be estimated by scoring systems such as the ""Modified WHO Prognostic Scoring System"", wherein scores between 1 and 4 from various parameters are summed together: Women with a score of 7 or greater are considered at high risk.

wikipedia-6322091," Pastern  The pastern is a part of the leg of a horse between the fetlock and the top of the hoof. It incorporates the long pastern bone (proximal phalanx) and the short pastern bone (middle phalanx), which are held together by two sets of paired ligaments to form the pastern joint (proximal interphalangeal joint). Anatomically homologous to the two largest bones found in the human finger, the pastern was famously mis-defined by Samuel Johnson in his dictionary as ""the knee of a horse"". When a lady asked Johnson how he came to do so, he gave the much-quoted reply: ""Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance."" Anatomy and importance of the pastern. The pastern consists of two bones, the uppermost called the ""large pastern bone"" or proximal phalanx, which begins just under the fetlock joint, and the lower called the ""small pastern bone"" or middle phalanx, located between the large pastern bone and the coffin bone, outwardly located at approximately the coronary band. The joint between these two bones is aptly called the ""pastern joint"". This joint has limited movement, but does help to disperse the concussive forces of the horse's step and also has some influence on the flexion or extension of the entire leg. The pastern is vital in shock absorption. When the horse's front leg is grounded, the elbow and knee are locked. Therefore, the fetlock and pastern are responsible for all the absorption of concussive forces of a footfall. Together, they effectively distribute it among both the bones of the leg and the tendons and ligaments. Matching angles. The slope of the shoulder is often the same as the slope of the pastern. The angle of the pastern should also match the angle of the hoof after it the latter has been trimmed (the angle will change as the hoof grows and may be off in a few weeks). This keeps the bones of the pastern and coffin joints in proper alignment, with a straight line running through their core. An angle broken forward or back increases the stress on these bones, joints, tendons, and ligaments. If the angle does not match, it could be an indication of poor farrier work, but some horses may have underlying conformational defects that can not be modified through farriery alone. Conformation. The pastern joint is evaluated when a horse is studied conformationally, as it will affect the gait of the horse and the soundness of the joints above it. Traditionally, the ideal pastern joint of the front leg was a 45-degree angle. However, this angle has been revised to a slightly steeper angle of 47-55 degrees, as the traditional angle, although it makes for comfortable riding, greatly increases the chance of breakdown. Because there is less need for shock absorption in the hindleg, its pasterns are somewhat more upright than those of the front leg, to increase its strength (about 49-59 degrees). If the hind pasterns are the same angle as the front, or too sloping in general, then they are likely to break down during the horse's career, especially if the horse in employed in strenuous work. The length of the pastern joint is determined by the length of the first phalanx. The short pastern bone is less a determinant because it is smaller, at 2 inches in length, and part of it is encased in the hoof. Long, sloping pasterns. Long, sloping pasterns are commonly seen in Thoroughbreds and Saddlebreds. A nicely sloped pastern increases the likelihood of a long career. It improves the animal's ability to travel on uneven terrain, helps it withstand the rigors of a competition or race, and makes the gait more comfortable for the rider. They are desired in a riding horse because they increase the shock-absorption ability of the leg, making the horse's gait smoother and more comfortable for the rider. However, this flexibility also increases the risk of certain connective tissue injuries that are not seen in horses with more upright pasterns. This is because many of the tendons and ligaments that go down the back of the leg continue under the back of the fetlock joint, and attach to either the pastern bones or the coffin bone. When the horse puts weight on his leg, the fetlock sinks closer to the ground, which is a needed response as it helps to absorb the shock of the footfall. However, when the pasterns are too long or sloping it does not support the fetlock enough, and the fetlock may hyper-extend, possibly to the point where the ergot touches the ground. This stresses the soft tissues that run under the fetlock because they are stretched longer. If stretched too much, they may tear or rupture. Medical problems that are more common in horses with long, sloping pasterns include: Short, upright pasterns. Short, upright pasterns are beneficial in that they decrease the chance that the horse will suffer from soft-tissue injury. However, upright pasterns increase concussion by transmitting more of the shock of footfalls to the bones rather than the tendons. This not only makes the gaits uncomfortable due to the jarring, but also increases the chance of arthritis and may shorten the animal's career. A short, upright pastern also decreases the stride length of the gait, which again makes the gait more uncomfortable and decreases the efficiency of the horse's movement (since he must take more strides per meter than a longer-strided horse). Medical problems linked to short, upright pasterns are usually a result of excess concussion. They include: Short, upright pasterns are often seen in draft horses. This is because draft horses bred for pulling rather than riding (and so they were not selected for smooth gaits of a saddle horse), and because upright pasterns give more leverage to dig into the ground as the horse pulls a heavy load. Short, upright pasterns are also commonly seen in Quarter Horses, Warmbloods, and Paint Horses. However, riding horses are more likely to have problems with upright pasterns than draft horses because they tend to work at faster speeds. Due to the lack of shock absorption, horses that have upright pasterns should be kept off hard surfaces whenever possible. "

The ancient Greek / Latin term ""heliocaminus"" literally means ""solar furnace"" and refers to a glass-enclosed sunroom intentionally designed to become hotter than the outside air temperature. During the Second Punic War (218 - 202 BC), the Greek scientist Archimedes is said to have repelled the attacking Roman ships by setting them on fire with a ""burning glass"" that may have been an array of mirrors. An experiment to test this theory was carried out by a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005. It concluded that although the theory was sound for stationary objects, the mirrors would not likely have been able to concentrate sufficient solar energy to set a ship on fire under battle conditions. The first modern solar furnace is believed to have been built in France in 1949 by Professor Félix Trombe. It is now still in place at Mont Louis, near Odeillo. The Pyrenees were chosen as the site because the area experiences clear skies up to 300 days a year. Another solar furnace was built in Uzbekistan as a part of a Soviet Union ""Sun"" Complex Research Facility impulsed by Academician S.A. Asimov. Uses. The rays are focused onto an area the size of a cooking pot and can reach , depending on the process installed, for example: It has been suggested that solar furnaces could be used in space to provide energy for manufacturing purposes.  Their reliance on sunny weather is a limiting factor as a source of renewable energy on Earth but could be tied to thermal energy storage systems for energy production through these periods and into the night. Smaller-scale devices. The solar furnace principle is being used to make inexpensive solar cookers and solar-powered barbecues, and for solar water pasteurization. A prototype Scheffler reflector is being constructed in India for use in a solar crematorium. This 50 m² reflector will generate temperatures of and displace 200–300 kg of firewood used per cremation. "
wikipedia-20603387," Injection port  An injection port is a medical device used for the administration of insulin or other physician approved medicine into the subcutaneous tissue (the tissue layer just below the skin). The device is similar to infusion sets used by insulin pumps, except it is configured to receive a syringe instead of a tubing system. An injection port is usually a disposable device applied by the patient and worn for period of 3-5 days. When giving shots via an injection port, the needle stays above the surface of the skin. Medication is delivered via a short, soft cannula. An injection port can be used in conjunction with multiple daily injections of insulin by people with diabetes. It can also be used for the subcutaneous administration of any other physician prescribed medication Applying, Wearing and Using. Injection ports are usually applied by the patient. The device comes with a needle surrounded by a soft cannula. The needle and cannula are manually inserted into the patient's tissue. Immediately after insertion the needle is removed and the cannula remains below the surface of the skin. Ports are usually worn on the abdomen, but can also be worn on other areas such as the buttocks, thigh or arm. Typical injection ports are worn for 3-5 days and then replaced with another port. Insulin is injected via a syringe into the injection port. Medication immediately flows through the device's cannula into the subcutaneous tissue layer. No medication is stored in the device (other than the small amount of dead-space in the medication channel within the device). Current Injection Ports. Insuflon. The Insuflon, manufactured and distributed by Unomedical, is inserted at a 20-45° angle and rests flush against the skin similar to an IV. I-Port. The I-Port, manufactured and distributed by Patton Medical Devices, is a domed shaped device with a cannula inserted at a 90° angle. The i-port Advance combines an i-port with an insertion device. "

Biography. Playing career. Melrose began his hockey career as a defenseman in the WCHL the Kamloops Chiefs in 1974, where he stayed for two years. He started the 1976–77 season with the Springfield Indians of the AHL, before moving mid-season to the Cincinnati Stingers of the WHA, where he stayed until 1979. Following the demise of the WHA and its subsequent absorption into the NHL, Melrose joined the Winnipeg Jets for the 1979–80 season. For the remainder of his playing career, Melrose split time between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings, as well as their assorted AHL affiliates. Melrose spent his final season playing with the Adirondack Red Wings of the AHL during the 1986–87 season. During his NHL playing career, he played 300 games, scoring 10 goals, with 23 assists and 728 penalty minutes. He also played in 7 playoff games with the Toronto Maple Leafs, assisting on 2 goals and receiving 38 penalty minutes. Coaching career. Upon retirement, Melrose immediately began coaching. He coached the 1987–1988 season with the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL, leading them to a 44–22–6 record and a Memorial Cup title. He coached the next season with the Seattle Thunderbirds before jumping to the AHL and coaching the Adirondack Red Wings. He spent three years with the Red Wings, leading them to a Calder Cup win in the 1991–1992 season. Beginning with the 1992–93 season, Melrose coached the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, leading them to the 1993 Stanley Cup Final, which they lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games. He continued coaching the Kings for two more seasons, finishing both years out of the playoffs and with losing records. He then spent 13 years as a hockey analyst with ESPN. (""NHL Tonight""/""DCI Tonight"") On June 4, 2008 Melrose stated on ""Pardon the Interruption"" that he missed coaching and would entertain any NHL coaching offers. He stated, ""I miss not having a dog in the fight."" The Tampa Bay Lightning hired Melrose as their head coach in June 2008. On October 21, 2008, Melrose recorded his first win as a head coach in over 13 years in a 3-2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers. On November 14, 2008, Melrose was fired by the Lightning with a 5-7-4 record. ESPN. Melrose joined ESPN in 1996 as a commentator and NHL analyst.

wikipedia-1790812," Zapfino  Zapfino is a calligraphic typeface designed for Linotype by typeface designer Hermann Zapf in 1998. It is based on an alphabet Zapf originally penned in 1944. As a font, it makes extensive use of ligatures and character variations (for example, the lower case letter d has nine variations). History. In 1983, Zapf had completed the typeface ""AMS Euler"" with Donald Knuth and David Siegel of Stanford University for the American Mathematical Society, a typeface for mathematical composition including fraktur and Greek letters. David Siegel had recently finished his studies at Stanford and was interested in entering the field of typography. He told Zapf his idea of making a typeface with a large number of glyph variations; he wanted to start with an example of Zapf's calligraphy that was reproduced in a publication by the Society of Typographical Arts in Chicago. Zapf was concerned that this was the wrong way to go, and while he was interested in creating a complicated program, he was worried about starting something new. However, Zapf remembered a page of calligraphy from his sketchbook from 1944, and considered the possibility of making a typeface from it. He had previously tried to create a calligraphic typeface for Stempel in 1948, but hot metal composition was too limiting on the freedom of swash characters. Such a result could only be achieved using modern digital technology, and so Zapf and Siegel began work on the complicated software necessary. Siegel also hired Gino Lee, a programmer from Boston, Massachusetts, to help work on the project. However, just before the project was completed, Siegel wrote a letter to Zapf, saying that his girlfriend had left him and that he had lost all interest in anything. Siegel abandoned the project and started a new life, working on bringing color to Macintosh computers and later becoming an Internet design expert. Zapfino's development had become seriously delayed, until Zapf presented the project to Linotype. They were prepared to complete it and reorganized the project. Zapf worked with Linotype to create four alphabets and various ornaments, flourishes, and other dingbats. ""Zapfino"" was released in 1998 as a Type 1 font. Availability. Apple Inc. includes Zapfino in Mac OS X and iOS, partly to demonstrate its advanced typographic features. The font includes over 1,400 glyphs as of the most recent version, and contains much bigger letters than the Zapfino fonts Linotype sells in retail channel. Since then, Linotype has extended Zapfino to include an additional Forte weight in their ""Zapfino Extra"" family which Apple has not licensed for distribution with Mac OS X. Zapfino Extra (2003). In 2003, Hermann Zapf completely reworked the Zapfino design, creating Zapfino Extra, a large expansion of the Zapfino family designed in close collaboration with Akira Kobayashi. This font family uses Apple Advanced Typography and OpenType technologies, allowing automatic ligatures and contextual glyph substitutions, accurately reflecting the fluid and dynamic nature of Zapf's calligraphy. This font family comes in 2 font weights, with 3 fonts in Forte weight and total of 12 fonts in the family. The Pro fonts contain glyphs found in other fonts of their respective weights. Zapfino Extra W1G (2010). It is a version Zapfino Extra with support of Greek and Cyrillic characters. The family includes Zapfino Extra Paneuropean W1G One font. OpenType features include access all alternates, fractions, standard ligatures, localized forms, ordinals, scientific inferiors, superscript/subscript, discretionary ligatures. Zapfino Extra Cyrillic One (2010). It is a subset of Zapfino Extra Paneuropean W1G One font with only support of Cyrillic characters. Additional OpenType features include ornaments. Zapfino Extra X (2003). Linotype also created Zapfino Extra X, which was based on the 1998 Zapfino fonts included with Mac OS X. This font family, like the Zapfino in Mac OS X, features letters four times larger than the Linotype counterpart. "
wikipedia-2312790," John Tsang  John Tsang Chun-wah (born 21 April 1951), GBM, JP, is the current Financial Secretary (FS) of Hong Kong. His responsibility is to assist the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in overseeing policy formulation and implementation in financial, monetary, economic, trade and employment matters. He exercises control over the Exchange Fund, with the assistance of the Monetary Authority. He is a member of the Executive Council. In an annual budget speech, he outlines the move to any Appropriation Bill. Education. Tsang, a Roman Catholic, was a secondary school student at La Salle College in Hong Kong and Stuyvesant High School in New York City, from which he graduated in 1969. He then studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also holds a master degree in bilingual education from Boston State College and a MPA from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Career. Through his teens and twenties, Tsang lived in the United States. In November 1982 he returned to Hong Kong after working with Boston Public School and joined the civil service, reportedly at the suggestion of Donald Tsang, with whom he became friends when they were at Harvard together. His first position was a two-year stint as Assistant District Officer for Shatin. He went on to positions in the former Finance Branch, Monetary Affairs Branch and the former Trade Department. From 1987 to 1992, he was first Administrative Assistant to then Financial Secretary, Sir Piers Jacobs. He was Assistant Director-General of Trade from 1992 to 1995 and Private Secretary to the former Governor, Chris Patten, from March 1995 to June 1997. In July 1997, Tsang was appointed Director-General of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London. In 1999 he returned from London and assumed the office of Commissioner of Customs and Excise. Before the Principal Officials Accountability System was introduced in July 2002, Tsang was Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands from 2001 to 2002. From August 2003 Tsang was Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology. In this role he was also Chair of the Sixth Ministerial Conference (MC6) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) held in Hong Kong from 13 to 18 December 2005. For his outstanding performance in the WTO, he even earned praise from Chinese president Hu Jintao.  Tsang then became the director of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong's Office, working directly for his friend Donald Tsang. He held the post from 2006 to June 2007.  In 2007 Tsang became Financial Secretary of Hong Kong. Health concern. In 2009, Tsang suffered a health scare on his return from a G-20 summit in Pittsburgh. On 27 September he was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital with a coronary artery blockage and underwent an angioplasty operation. He recovered and was discharged from hospital on 3 October, assuring the media that the operation would not affect his work. Controversy. Cyberport defence. In 1998 and 1999 Donald Tsang, representing the Hong Kong government, met with Richard Li, chairman of Pacific Century Group regarding the Cyberport construction project. On 2 March 1999 both signed a document that said PCG would occupy 20–50% of the total office space within the first five years of Cyberport. Under a ""take-up guarantee"", PCG was required to pay the 50% rent if not enough tenants showed up. But in exchange PCG would be allowed to occupy as much as 50% of the government-owned IT infrastructure. In 2000 the take-up was suddenly dropped by the government. (Cyberport struggled to attract tenants, was becoming unpopular with Dot-com bubble problem) Democratic Party member Lee Wing-tat demanded that records of meetings between Donald Tsang and Richard Li should be revealed to show PCG was not colluded with the government. John Tsang strongly defended Donald Tsang to not reveal anything. 2011 budget demonstration. On 23 February 2011, John Tsang delivered the annual ""2011–2012 HK Budget summary"". The HK government was under pressure to give some of the money back to the community. After trying to move the surplus into a Mandatory Provident Fund, citizens began complaining. About 10,000 protesters showed up at Central to demonstrate. The mismanagement of the funds opened a number of controversies. ILSP controversy. In January 2011 HK government's IT chief information officer Jeremy Godfrey stepped down from his job for ""personal reasons"". On 10, May 2011 in a letter to the Legislative council, he said those personal reasons were not real. That the real reason why he quit was related to Elizabeth Tse (謝曼怡) and John Tsang. It turns out there were arguments over the implementation of the Internet Learning Support Program (ILSP). It was revealed that Tse and Tsang forced the HK$220 million contract to be awarded to a company called iProA. The company turned out to be founded by Elizabeth Quat, a member of the pro-Beijing DAB. Tsang responded that the accusations are ridiculous and absurd. Godfrey have since come out to state that Quat herself has nothing to do with the ILSP controversy. But said the IT decision was politicised. "

wikipedia-1706860," Bayesian experimental design  Bayesian experimental design provides a general probability-theoretical framework from which other theories on experimental design can be derived. It is based on Bayesian inference to interpret the observations/data acquired during the experiment. This allows accounting for both any prior knowledge on the parameters to be determined as well as uncertainties in observations. The theory of Bayesian experimental design is to a certain extent based on the theory for making optimal decisions under uncertainty. The aim when designing an experiment is to maximize the expected utility of the experiment outcome. The utility is most commonly defined in terms of a measure of the accuracy of the information provided by the experiment (e.g. the Shannon information or the negative variance), but may also involve factors such as the financial cost of performing the experiment. What will be the optimal experiment design depends on the particular utility criterion chosen. Relations to more specialized optimal design theory. Linear theory. If the model is linear, the prior probability density function (PDF) is homogeneous and observational errors are normally distributed, the theory simplifies to the classical optimal experimental design theory. Approximate normality. In numerous publications on Bayesian experimental design, it is (often implicitly) assumed that all posterior PDFs will be approximately normal. This allows for the expected utility to be calculated using linear theory, averaging over the space of model parameters, an approach reviewed in . Caution must however be taken when applying this method, since approximate normality of all possible posteriors is difficult to verify, even in cases of normal observational errors and uniform prior PDF. Posterior distribution. Recently, increased computational resources allow inference of the posterior distribution of model parameters, which can directly be used for experiment design. proposed an approach that uses the posterior predictive distribution to assess the effect of new measurements on prediction uncertainty, while suggest maximizing the mutual information between parameters, predictions and potential new experiments. Mathematical formulation. Given a vector formula_1 of parameters to determine, a prior PDF formula_2 over those parameters and a PDF formula_3 for making observation formula_4, given parameter values formula_1 and an experiment design formula_6, the posterior PDF can be calculated using Bayes' theorem where formula_8 is the marginal probability density in observation space The expected utility of an experiment with design formula_6 can then be defined where formula_12 is some real-valued functional of the posterior PDF formula_13 after making observation formula_4 using an experiment design formula_6. Gain in Shannon information as utility. Utility may be defined as the prior-posterior gain in Shannon information Note also that the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the prior from the posterior distribution. of which the latter can be evaluated without the need for evaluating individual posterior PDFs formula_19 for all possible observations formula_4. Worth noting is that the first term on the second equation line will not depend on the design formula_6, as long as the observational uncertainty doesn't. On the other hand, the integral of formula_22 in the first form is constant for all formula_6, so if the goal is to choose the design with the highest utility, the term need not be computed at all. Several authors have considered numerical techniques for evaluating and optimizing this criterion, e.g. and . Note that the expected information gain being exactly the mutual information between the parameter ""θ"" and the observation ""y"". also derived just such a utility function for a gambler seeking to profit maximally from side information in a horse race; Kelly's situation is identical to the foregoing, with the side information, or ""private wire"" taking the place of the experiment.

wikipedia-5331126," Lester Sumrall  Lester Frank Sumrall (February 15, 1913 – April 28, 1996) was an American Pentecostal pastor and evangelist. He founded the Lester Sumrall Evangelistic Association (LeSEA) and its humanitarian arm LeSEA Global Feed the Hungry, World Harvest Radio International, and World Harvest Bible College. Biography. Sumrall was born to Betty and George Sumrall in New Orleans on February 15, 1913. He began preaching at the age of 17 after, what he believed to be, a miraculous recovery from tuberculosis. At the age of 19, he founded a church in Green Forest, Arkansas, and was ordained by the Assemblies of God. In 1934, Sumrall began traveling abroad. He preached in Tahiti and New Zealand and established a church in Brisbane, Australia. He traveled with Howard Carter throughout eastern Asia and Europe. In South America, Sumrall met Louise Layman. The couple were married on September 30, 1944, and had three children: Frank Lester (born 1946), Phillip Stephen (1950) and Peter Andrew (1953). The Sumrall and his family spent many years in the Philippines during the 1950s. The culmination of his evangelistic work in that country was the establishment of the Cathedral of Praise in Manila. With over 24,000 members, it is the largest congregation in the Philippines. In 1957, Sumrall established the Lester Sumrall Evangelistic Association. He would also found World Harvest Bible College (now Indiana Christian University) and ""World Harvest Magazine"". In 1963, Sumrall moved to South Bend, Indiana, to pastor Christian Center Cathedral of Praise (now Christian Center Church). It was around this time that he withdrew from the Assemblies of God denomination. In 1968, Sumrall began what would become World Harvest Radio International. Sumrall has been called the ""father of Christian television"". From 1972 to 1997, he acquired television stations throughout the United States as part of World Harvest Television (also known as LeSEA Broadcasting). In 1987, Sumrall established a humanitarian aid organization, LeSEA Global Feed the Hungry. Sumrall died on April 28, 1996, at age 83. "
wikipedia-371656," Bornite  Bornite, also known as peacock ore, is a sulfide mineral with chemical composition Cu5FeS4 that crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (pseudo-cubic). Appearance. Bornite has a brown to copper-red color on fresh surfaces that tarnishes to various iridescent shades of blue to purple in places. Its striking iridescence gives it the nickname ""peacock copper"" or ""peacock ore"". Mineralogy. Bornite is an important copper ore mineral and occurs widely in porphyry copper deposits along with the more common chalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite and bornite are both typically replaced by chalcocite and covellite in the supergene enrichment zone of copper deposits. Bornite is also found as disseminations in mafic igneous rocks, in contact metamorphic skarn deposits, in pegmatites and in sedimentary cupriferous shales. It is important as an ore for its copper content of about 63 percent by mass. Occurrence. It occurs globally in copper ores with notable crystal localities in Butte, Montana and at Bristol, Connecticut in the U. S. It is also collected from the Carn Brea mine, Illogan, and elsewhere in Cornwall, England. Large crystals are found from the Frossnitz Alps, eastern Tirol, Austria; the Mangula mine, Lomagundi district, Zimbabwe; from the N’ouva mine, Talate, Morocco, the West Coast of Tasmania and in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. History and etymology. It was first described in 1725 for an occurrence in the Krušné Hory Mountains (Erzgebirge), Karlovy Vary Region, Bohemia in what is now the Czech Republic. It was named in 1845 for Austrian mineralogist Ignaz von Born (1742–1791). "
wikipedia-1747513," Glen Canyon  Glen Canyon is a canyon that is located in southeastern and south central Utah and northwestern Arizona within the Vermilion Cliffs area. An immense area located north of the Grand Canyon, it too was carved by the Colorado River. A reservoir, Lake Powell, was created by the Glen Canyon Dam. Glen Canyon Dam was completed in 1963, destroying much of Glen Canyon. Lake Powell emerged from a struggle over damming Dinosaur National Monument. The Sierra Club and its leader, David Brower, were instrumental in blocking the dam in Dinosaur, ignoring Glen Canyon in the process. Before Glen Canyon was flooded, but after the struggle in Congress, Brower floated the canyon and realized what a tremendous resource it was. This experience transformed Brower's attitude towards environmental preservation, making him more radical and less likely to compromise. It was very similar to the experience of John Muir with the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. For Brower, it steeled him for the battle over a dam in the Grand Canyon. Beginning in the late 1990s, the Sierra Club and other organizations renewed the call to drain Lake Powell in Lower Glen Canyon. Pre-dam history and rescue archaeology. Around 1956, archaeologists and biologists from the University of Utah and the Museum of Northern Arizona, using National Park research grants, planned an emergency excavation of Lower Glen Canyon, which was soon to be flooded by the new Glen Canyon Dam. Between 1958 and 1960, four investigative phases, combined with other surveys prior to 1957, discovered 250 sites. Beginning in 1958, the Lower Glen Canyon survey was finished. Excavations. Excavations began during the summer of 1958 on 16 sites. A thesis emerged that prehistoric people living permanently on the highlands south of Glen Canyon, and on the Cummings Mesa, farmed the Lower Glen Canyon on a seasonal basis, and gathered raw materials. To prove this thesis of seasonal habitation, criteria such as architectural units, locations of trail systems, occurrence of ceremonial structures, prevalence of burials, and position of natural and cultural strata. Four types of sites are described in the survey classified as either open sites situated on rock terraces; talus sites on broken material below cliffs; shelter sites in protected areas under overhanging cliffs; and cliff sites beneath ledges or in caves and canyon walls. Open sites are the majority on both sides of the river. The majority of sites, mostly Navajo camps, feature lithic garbage or ceramics, or both. Talus sites are rarely recorded.  Most of the cultural remains found are chipped stone tools (lithic materials), including projectile points, scrapers, drills, knives, choppers, and ground stone tools and manos (grinders). The collection of sherds are mostly Tusayan Gray Ware and Tusayan White Ware. Petroglyph panels are found throughout Glen Canyon. “Pecked and incised figures depict mountain sheep, human figures, birds, human handprints and animal tracks. Geometric figures range from circles and spirals to highly complex rectilinear patterns. The human figures have triangular bodies. Painted figures have been reported for both sides of the river... Petroglyph panels of such quality are lacking from the highland regions adjacent to Glen Canyon” (Long 61). Prehistoric cultural periods. Studies indicate a chronology for the Lower Glen Canyon prehistory, “from pre-A.D. 1 to the 15th century and recorded history from 1776 to the present” (Long 61).  Most of the ceramic material found in the main canyon was probably made in the highlands, although it is possible some pottery was manufactured in Lower Glen Canyon. Clay deposits are found along the river, and some crude pottery specimens, that may have been made there. Only four burials were found in Lower Glen Canyon at three sites. Trash dumps are not very common at most sites. This is more evidence to suggest the seasonal occupation of hunters and farmers. Historic periods. Recorded history begins with the Dominguez-Escalante expedition in 1776.  Cultural similarities are based on the presence, or absence, of certain types of ceramic wares. (Long 63). Group types of pottery include Kayenta (Tusayan and Tsegi Orange Ware), Virgin (San Juan Red and White Wares), with Fremont, and Mesa Verde or Anasazi types of White and Desert Gray Ware found mostly on the right bank of Colorado. Basketmaker II is characterized by a lack of pottery, and above ground and underground cists lined with slabs.  There is very little evidence of permanent occupation except at Talus Ruin, a small pueblo with a kiva, a ceremonial structure, made mostly of masonry, featuring jacal walls of sticks and reeds set in mortar in a single row of masonry. The presence of metates are evidence that campsites with slab-lined hearths being inhabited for longer periods. Agricultural structures are not found in the main lower canyon, and no formalized fields are found in the main canyon because of alleviation and slope wash burying (Long, 66). Houses, when found, were mostly sandstone slab with mortar, having one to seven rooms. “Well constructed mealing bins which usually denote permanency were lacking in the Lower Glen Canyon. In contrast, on Cummings Mesa at Surprise Pueblo, there was one entire room devoted to mealing bins…” (Long 65). In the highlands, granaries were near or incorporated into permanent Pueblos, compared with smaller ones near temporary sites in the Canyon (Long 66). “Home Base” pueblos in the nearby highlands on Cummings Mesa and Paiute Mesa are believed to support the temporary farming and the hunting parties who used an extensive trail system in the main canyon, still in use today. Natural resources for tool-making. “Stone tool manufacturing appears to have been an important industry for the entire Glen Canyon region, perhaps one of the major reasons for occupation” (Long 66). Cryptocrystalline rocks fill the Pleistocene gravel beds on the Carmel platforms. Scattered lithic tools and materials indicate workshops of various sizes. There is a lack of siliceous material in the highlands, but tools are found there made from the gravel beds in the river.  There are very few ground stone artifacts, such as manos, metates, and scrapers, found in the main canyon, since these tools are mainly found in the highlands. In the main canyon, a large number of chipped implements, ranging from small arrowheads to large knives, are found. Finished tools, and possibly blanks taken to the mesa, were probably used for trade. "
wikipedia-9606955," Hypervideo  Hypervideo, or hyperlinked video, is a displayed video stream that contains embedded, user-clickable anchors, allowing navigation between video and other hypermedia elements. Hypervideo is thus analogous to hypertext, which allows a reader to click on a word in one document and retrieve information from another document, or from another place in the same document. That is, hypervideo combines video with a non linear information structure, allowing a user to make choices based on the content of the video and the user's interests. A crucial difference between hypervideo and hypertext is the element of time. Text is normally static, while a video is necessarily dynamic; the content of the video changes with time. Consequently, hypervideo has different technical, aesthetic, and rhetorical requirements than a static hypertext page. For example, hypervideo might involve the creation of a link from an object in a video that is visible for only a certain duration. It is therefore necessary to segment the video appropriately and add the metadata required to link from frames—or even objects—in a video to the pertinent information in other media forms. History of Hypervideo. Illustrating the natural progression to hypervideo from hypertext, the software ""Storyspace"", a hypertext writing environment, employs a spatial metaphor for displaying links. ""Storyspace"" utilizes 'writing spaces', generic containers for content, which link to other writing spaces. ""HyperCafe"", a popular experimental prototype of hypervideo, made use of this tool to create ""narrative video spaces"". ""HyperCafe"" was developed as an early model of a hypervideo system, placing users in a virtual cafe where the user dynamically interacts with the video to follow different conversations. Video to video linking was demonstrated by the Interactive Cinema Group at the MIT Media Lab. ""Elastic Charles"" was a hypermedia journal developed between 1988 and 1989, in which ""micons"" were placed inside a video, indicating links to other content. When implementing the Interactive Kon-Tiki Museum, Listol used micons in order to represent video footnotes. Video footnotes were a deliberate extension of the literary footnote applied to annotating video, thereby providing continuity between traditional text and early hypervideo. In 1993, Hirata et al. considered media based navigation for hypermedia systems, where the same type of media is used as a query as for the media to be retrieved. For example, a part of an image (defined by shape, or color, for example) could link to a related image. In this approach, the content of the video becomes the basis of forming the links to other related content. ""HotVideo"" was an implementation of this kind of hypervideo, developed at IBM's China Research Laboratory in 1996. Navigation to associated resources was accomplished by clicking on a dynamic object in a video. In 1997, a project of the MIT Media Lab's Object-Based Media Group called ""Hypersoap"" further developed this concept. ""HyperSoap"" was a short soap opera program in which a viewer could click with an enhanced remote control on objects in the video to find information on how they could be purchased. The company Watchpoint Media was formed in order to commercialize the technology involved, resulting in product called Storyteller, oriented towards interactive television. Watchpoint Media was acquired by Goldpocket in 2003, which was in turn acquired by Tandberg Television in late 2005. eline Technologies, founded in 1999, developed the first viable hypervideo solutions called VideoClix. Today VideoClix is the most widely used SaaS (Software as a Service) solution to distribute and monetize clickable video on the web and mobile devices. With the advantage that its videos can play back in popular video players such as QuickTime and Flash as well as multiple OVPs (online video platforms) such as Brightcove, ThePlatform and Ooyala. VideoClix also offers technology that can be integrated into any 3rd party players based on Quicktime, Flash, Mpeg4 and HTML5. this product has proven to be a commercial success. In 2006, eline Technologies was acquired by VideoClix Inc. VideoClix client base include Disney, ESPN, MTV networks, Dailymotion, Revision 3 as well as Brands such as Apple, Kraft, Fruit of the loom and many others. In 1997, the Israeli software firm Ephyx Technologies released a product called ""v-active"", one of the first commercial object based authoring system for hypervideo. This technology was not a success, however; Ephyx changed its name to Veon in 1999, at which time it shifted focus away from hypervideo to the provision of development tools for web and broadband content. Concepts and Technical Challenges. Hypervideo is challenging, compared to hyperlinked text, due to the unique difficulty video presents in node segmentation; that is, separating a video into algorithmically identifiable, linkable content. Video, at its most basic, is a time sequence of images, which are in turn simply two dimensional arrays of color information. In order to segment a video into meaningful pieces (objects in images, or scenes within videos), it is necessary to provide a context, both in space and time, to extract meaningful elements from this image sequence. Humans are naturally able to perform this task; however, developing a method to achieve this automatically (or by algorithm) is a complex problem. And it is desirable to do this algorithmically. At an NTSC frame rate of 30 frames per second, even a short video of 30 seconds comprises 900 frames. The identification of distinct video elements would be a tedious task if human intervention were required for every frame. Clearly, even for moderate amounts of video material, manual segmentation is unrealistic. From the standpoint of time, the smallest unit of a video is the frame (the finest time granularity). Node segmentation could be performed at the frame level—a straightforward task as a frame is easily identifiable. However, a single frame cannot contain video information, since videos are necessarily dynamic. Analogously, a single word separated from a text does not convey meaning. Thus it is necessary to consider the scene, which is the next level of temporal organization. A scene can be defined as the minimum sequential set of frames that conveys meaning. This is an important concept for hypervideo, as one might wish a hypervideo link to be active throughout one scene, though not in the next. Scene granularity is therefore natural in the creation of hypervideo. Consequently, hypervideo requires algorithms capable of detecting scene transitions. Of course, one can imagine coarser levels of temporal organization. Scenes can be grouped together to form a narrative sequence, which in turn are grouped to form a video; from the point of view of node segmentation, these concepts are not as critical. Issues of time in hypervideo were considered extensively in the creation of the ""HyperCafe"". Even if the frame is the smallest time unit, one can still spatially segment a video at a sub-frame level, separating the frame image into its constituent objects; this is necessary when performing node segmentation at the object level. Time introduces complexity in this case also, for even after an object is differentiated in one frame, it is usually necessary to follow the same object through a sequence of frames. This process, known as object tracking, is essential to the creation of links from objects in videos. Spatial segmentation of object can be achieved, for example, through the use of intensity gradients to detect edges, color histograms to match regions, motion detection, or a combination of these and other methods. Once the required nodes have been segmented and combined with the associated linking information, this metadata must be incorporated with the original video for playback. The metadata is placed conceptually in layers, or tracks, on top of the video; this layered structure is then presented to the user for viewing and interaction. Thus the display technology, the hypervideo player, should not be neglected when creating hypervideo content. For example, efficiency can be gained by storing the geometry of areas associated with tracked objects only in certain keyframes, and allowing the player to interpolate between these keyframes, as developed for ""HotVideo"" by IBM. Furthermore, the creators of ""VideoClix"" emphasize the fact that its content plays back on standard players, such as Quicktime and Flash. When one considers that the Flash player alone is installed on over 98% of internet enabled desktops in mature markets, this a perhaps a reason for the success of this product in the current arena. The rise of hypervideo. As the first steps in hypervideo were taken in the late 1980s, it would appear that hypervideo is taking unexpectedly long to realize its potential. Many experiments (""HyperCafe"", ""HyperSoap"") have not been extensively followed up on, and authoring tools are at the moment available from only a small number of providers. However, perhaps with the wider availability of broadband internet, this situation is rapidly changing. Interest in hypervideo is increasing, as reflected in popular blogs on the subject, as well as the extraordinary rise of the internet phenomenon YouTube. Furthermore, by 2010, some estimates have internet downloads claiming over one third of the market for on-demand video. As the amount of video content increases and becomes available on the internet, the possibilities for linking video increase even faster. Digital libraries are constantly growing, of which video is an important part. News outlets have amassed vast video archives, which could be useful in education and historical research. Direct searching of pictures or videos, a much harder task then indexing and searching text, could be greatly facilitated by hypervideo methods. Commentary. User replies to video content, traditionally in the form of text or image links which are not embedded into the playback sequence of the video, have been allowed through such video hosting services as Viddler to become embedded both within the imagery of the video and within portions of the playback (via selected time lengths inside the Progress slider element); this feature has become known as ""video comments"" or ""audio comments"". Commercial exploitation. Perhaps the most significant consequence of hypervideo will result from commercial advertising. Devising a business model to monetize video has proven notoriously difficult. The application of traditional advertising methods—for example introducing ads into video—is likely to be rejected by the online community, while revenue from selling advertising on video sharing sites has so far not been promising. Hypervideo offers an alternate way to monetize video, allowing for the possibility of creating video clips where objects link to advertising or e-commerce sites, or provide more information about particular products. This new model of advertising is less intrusive, only displaying advertising information when the user makes the choice by clicking on an object in a video. And since it is the user who has requested the product information, this type of advertising is better targeted and likely to be more effective. Ultimately as hypervideo content proliferates on the Internet, particularly content targeted for delivery via the television set, one can imagine an interlinked web of hypervideo forming in much the same way as the hypertext based World Wide Web has formed. This hypervideo based ""Web of Televisions"" or ""TeleWeb"" would offer the same browsing and information mining power of the Web, but be more suited to the viewing experience of being 10 feet from the screen on the living room couch than the Web is. Here may form an environment of not only interactive ads, but also one of interactive and nonlinear news, information, and even story telling. The future of hypervideo. The above mentioned ""Web of Televisions"" or ""TeleWeb"" concepts are likely to become widely adopted as implemented by future advanced Set-Top-Box and Game-Box units with the ability to provide both the 10 foot TV and 2-foot Web experience. The addition of a wireless display and remote control ties together Web and TV, in this scenario clicking objects is non disruptive to movies and TV shows. The full screen video display provides the 10 foot video experience while supplemental content, commerce and advertising related to clicking video objects is placed on the additional display and remote control unit that provides the 2-foot PC experience.

wikipedia-2336228," Aurora kinase  Aurora kinases are serine/threonine kinases that are essential for cell proliferation. The enzyme helps the dividing cell dispense its genetic materials to its daughter cells. More specifically, Aurora kinases play a crucial role in cellular division by controlling chromatid segregation. Defects in this segregation can cause genetic instability, a condition which is highly associated with tumorigenesis. Three Aurora kinases have been identified in mammalian cells to date. Besides being implicated as mitotic regulators, these three kinases have generated significant interest in the cancer research field due to their elevated expression profiles in many human cancers. The human Aurora kinases present a similar domain organization, with a N-terminal domain of 39 to 129 residues in length, a protein kinase domain and a short C-terminal domain containing 15 to 20 residues. The N-terminal domain of three proteins share low sequence conservation, which determines selectivity during protein-protein interactions (Bolanos-Garcia, 2005).  Classes. As, mentioned above, there are three classes of aurora kinases:  "
wikipedia-2235646," Eye to the Telescope  Eye to the Telescope is the debut album by British singer-songwriter KT Tunstall, originally released 13 December 2004 (see 2004 in British music), and re-released 10 January 2005 by Relentless Records. On 19 July 2005 it was nominated for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize in the United Kingdom. Tunstall promoted the album in the United States and Canada in December 2005. The album was released 7 February 2006 in the U.S. Also a special CD/DVD edition of the album was released in September 2006 in America, along with a different cover and a bonus track. Critical reception. Reviews for ""Eye to the Telescope"" were positive. Mark A. Price of PopMatters gave the album a score of 7 out of 10, noting that it manages to sound ""both new and familiar"", mixing influences from artists like Melissa Etheridge and Fiona Apple while adding some originality of her own. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it ""a promising, satisfying debut"". On Metacritic, ""Eye to the Telescope"" has a score of 76 out of 100, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Track listing. The original edition of the album, released in December 2004, had a slightly different track order and did not include the studio version of ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree""; the version of the track recorded on ""Later... with Jools Holland"" was included as a ""bonus live track"". Charts performance. The album entered the UK album chart at 73 and quickly dropped out again (it originally entered the lower regions of the Top 200 in its debut week, but these placings are not officially recorded for statistical purposes). It re-entered at 66 a few weeks later, and its rise was both surprising and unique for a new album on the UK charts. It improved every week for four weeks before peaking at number 36, then dropping down as low as 63 again. It then resumed a somewhat meteoric rise, culminating in a peak of number seven before slowly shifting back down. The publicity surrounding Tunstall's Mercury Music Prize nomination sent it back up the charts to an eventual peak of No. 3, after which time it became a Top 20 mainstay for the rest of 2005. It dropped out of the Top 10 in the 61st week, and has dropped continually since, before ending its run at 72 weeks. After a several month absence, the album returned at No. 66 for a 73rd non-consecutive week in August 2006. The singles from the album became increasingly more successful, with ""Other Side of the World"" spending almost five months on the chart and ""Suddenly I See"" remaining in the Top 40 for 10 weeks. The album's next single, ""Under the Weather"", entered the chart at No. 39, while the fifth and final single, ""Another Place to Fall"", became Tunstall's first single to miss the Top 40 after more than 1.3 million copies of the album had been sold. In total, Tunstall has spent 133 weeks so far on the British charts. The album was certified 5× platinum by the Irish album chart selling about 75,000 copies, and shipping 1.5 million copies in the UK, certifying it 5× platinum there as well. It was also certified platinum in Canada in January 2007. Worldwide, the album has sold 2.6 million copies. Charts. From αCharts "
wikipedia-1357519," Battle of Frenchtown  The Battle of Frenchtown, also known as the Battle of the River Raisin or the River Raisin Massacre, was a series of conflicts that took place from January 18–23, 1813 during the War of 1812. It was fought between the United States and a British and Native American alliance near the River Raisin in Frenchtown, Michigan Territory (present-day Monroe, Michigan). On January 18, 1813 the Americans forced the retreat of the British and their Indian allies from Frenchtown, which they had earlier occupied, in a relatively minor skirmish. The encounter was part of a larger plan to advance north and retake Fort Detroit following the loss of the fort in the Siege of Detroit the previous summer. Despite the initial American success, the British and Native Americans rallied and launched a surprise counterattack four days later on January 22. Three hundred ninety-seven Americans were killed in this second battle, while hundreds were taken prisoner and dozens of them killed in a subsequent massacre by Native Americans the following day. It was the deadliest conflict ever fought on Michigan soil, and the casualties included the highest number of Americans killed in a single battle during the War of 1812. Parts of the original battlefield have recently been designated as the River Raisin National Battlefield Park. Naming. The Battle of Frenchtown is so named because it took place within Frenchtown in the Michigan Territory, although much of the land on which it took place is now incorporated within the city of Monroe. The name is sometimes used to refer solely to the conflict that took place on January 22, 1813, while the conflict that took place on January 18 is sometimes referred to as the First Battle of the River Raisin or as merely a prelude to the larger encounter on January 22. The plural term Battle""s"" of Frenchtown is also used to refer to the overall conflict between January 18–22. While the battle began on January 18, the heaviest of fighting took place on January 22 and may have continued for several days. It is often called the Battle of the River Raisin, because of its proximity to the River Raisin. The engagement may be divided into the First Battle of the River Raisin (January 18) and the Second Battle of the River Raisin (January 22). The name River Raisin Massacre is used for January 23, one day after the surrender, when pro-British Indians murdered dozens of wounded Kentucky volunteers who were too badly injured to march as prisoners. Background. On August 17, 1812, Brigadier General William Hull, commanding the American Army of the Northwest, surrendered his troops and Fort Detroit to the British following the Siege of Detroit. The British success convinced many Native Americans to side with them. General Hull was later tried by a military court and sentenced to death for his disgraceful conduct at Detroit. However, President James Madison commuted the sentence to dismissal from the army in recognition of Hull’s honorable service during the American Revolution. At the time, Fort Detroit was an important outpost that could allow the Americans to invade British Upper Canada. Its capture instead allowed British forces to increase their numbers in the Michigan Territory. After the British seized Detroit, the militia around Frenchtown also surrendered and were disarmed. Only south of Fort Detroit, the residents of Frenchtown feared threats from the British and Native Americans, who had now occupied the area. The people of Frenchtown urged the American army to regroup to drive the invaders back to Upper Canada. After Hull's dismissal, Brigadier General James Winchester was given command of the Army of the Northwest. Rather than pushing north to attempt to retake Detroit, Winchester had a lesser agenda, and his unpopularity led to the command of the army being given to Major General William Henry Harrison. Winchester was made second-in-command. Harrison's first plan of action on taking command was to move the army north to recover Detroit. To accomplish this, he divided the army and personally led one column, the second column marching under command of Winchester. Meanwhile, Brigadier General Henry Procter, commanding the British Army around Detroit, had assembled all the British troops in the area, as well as around 500 allied Native Americans under the Shawnee leader Tecumseh. While Tecumseh was present at Frenchtown, he did not participate in the fighting. First Battle of the River Raisin. James Winchester, the second-in-command of the Army of the Northwest, led a column consisting of approximately 1,000 inexperienced regulars and volunteers, most of whom came from Kentucky. Major General William Henry Harrison had ordered him to remain within supporting distance of Harrison's column near the Maumee River (in present-day Perrysburg, Ohio) about south of Frenchtown. Instead, Winchester ignored his orders and sent a small relief detachment north to Frenchtown along the River Raisin. Lieutenant Colonel William Lewis led these men across the frozen Maumee River and along the coast of Lake Erie to the River Raisin. His force consisted of 667 Kentuckians and about 100 local French-speaking militiamen. On January 18, 1813, Lewis charged across the frozen River Raisin to attack the British and Indian camp, which contained 63 soldiers of the Essex Militia, accompanied by a 3-pounder cannon, and about 200 Potawatomies. A brisk battle took place before the Americans forced the British and their allies to retreat. The Canadians charged the American lines several times, supported by the gunfire of the Indians. Fighting continued sporadically for several hours, with the Canadians and natives fighting log to log after which Lewis reclaimed Frenchtown. Reynolds' brother commented later how the Essex Militia “fought most bravely, retired slowly from log to log.” In fact, the skirmish has been noted as one of a few examples where Canadian militia stood fast without the backing of British regulars during the war. Kentucky Rifleman William Atherton's memoires offer gruesome testimony to how adept the Essex men and natives were at bush fighting, stating “the fight now became very close, and extremely hot ... I received a wound in my right shoulder.” The moment before Atherton was hit he witnessed two of his fellow riflemen move too far forward. One was killed and the other wounded. Atherton described perfectly the tactics used by Reynolds and his men: “Their method was to retreat rapidly until they were out of sight (which was soon the case in the brushy woods) and while we were advancing they were preparing to give us another fire; so we were generally under the necessity of firing upon them as they were retreating.” Another Kentucky private had similar recollections: “As we advanced they were firing themselves behind logs, trees, etc. to the best advantage.” After a long, bloody and exhaustive withdrawal over two miles of woodland, the Canadians and natives slipped away, leaving Frenchtown to the Kentuckians. This skirmish would later be known as the First Battle of the River Raisin. During their retreat from Frenchtown, the Native Americans looted the small settlement of Sandy Creek about north of the River Raisin, which had been settled in 1780. All 16 houses were burned to the ground, and at least two of the residents were killed. Sandy Creek was never rebuilt. Second Battle of the River Raisin. Following the recapture of Frenchtown, Brigadier General James Winchester and the rest of his troops met with Colonel Lewis two days later on January 20, 1813. Winchester had acted without orders, but Harrison was pleased with Lewis’s success. However, Harrison was concerned that the British forces might combine and overpower Winchester’s small force. He ordered additional men, including three companies of the 17th U.S. Infantry and one company of the 19th U.S. Infantry, to move to Frenchtown. He then sent a messenger to Winchester to order him to hold the ground and prepare for further combat. Winchester's soldiers were largely untrained and inexperienced, and the First Battle of the River Raisin was the first combat most had seen. Furthermore, Winchester's planning was poor. Ammunition and other necessary supplies had not been brought forward from the Maumee River. The palisade around the town had not been strengthened, and the regulars of the 17th and 19th U.S. Infantry were camped outside its walls. Several days after the first clash, local residents reported to Winchester that a large British force was heading toward Frenchtown. Winchester ignored their warning, insisting it would be ""some days"" before the British ""would be ready to do anything."" His troops were camped throughout Frenchtown. Without ensuring that sentries and pickets had been placed, Winchester retired for the night to his headquarters at the Navarre House south of the town. On hearing that the Americans had recaptured Frenchtown, Brigadier General Henry Procter, commander of the British forces around Detroit, marched with his troops from Fort Malden and crossed the Detroit River from Upper Canada, invading Michigan in strength. His army consisted of 597 regulars from the 41st Regiment of Foot and Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, joined by about 800 Indians. Shawnee leader Tecumseh was in the area, but he was not present at the Battle of Frenchtown. He left command of the Native Americans to Wyandot chiefs Roundhead and Walk-in-the-Water. The Indians included Shawnee, Potawatomi, Ottawa, Chippewa, Delaware, Miami, Winnebago, Creek, Sauk, and Fox tribes. Procter's artillery consisted of six light 3-pounder cannons drawn on sledges, manned by men from the Canadian Provincial Marine. Procter halted about north of the River Raisin to prepare for battle on January 21. Proctor surprised the American forces before sunrise on January 22. A Canadian volunteer, John Richardson, who marched with the 41st Regiment of Foot, later wrote, ""On the 22nd, before daybreak, came within sight of the enemy... such was their security and negligence that... our line was actually half formed within musket shot of their defenses before they were even aware of our presence."" The American regulars only stood for twenty minutes. These four companies of regular infantry, consisting mostly of green recruits, were caught in the open; faced with heavy musket volleys while being under direct roundshot and canister fire from the six 3-pounders and being flanked by the Essex militia and natives, they broke and fled. General Winchester was awakened by the roar of artillery fire and rushed to the battlefield, sending 240 men from the 1st Kentucky Rifle Regiment along with Col. John Allen to reinforce the regulars. It was to no avail. Under fire from three sides, the American troops fell into a headlong retreat towards Ohio. They attempted to rally three separate times, but were eventually surrounded on a narrow road. Nearly 220 of the 400 Americans had been killed, many of them shot, tomahawked and scalped during their withdrawal. 147, including Winchester were captured by natives and Canadian militia on the way. Chief Roundhead stripped him of his uniform before handing him to the British, which led to the legend that he was captured in his nightshirt. The American were scattered and not in any position to fight. The 17th's colonel, John Allen, was shot dead and scalped. Dozens tried to surrender and laid down their weapons, only to be shot or tomahawked by the Indians. Members of other units also tried to flee, but most were chased down and killed. A few removed their shoes and ran through the snow in their stockings to leave footprints that looked like moccasin and thus managed to escape. The British occupied a large barn, which was set on fire by William Orlando Butler, forcing them from their shelter. The 1st, 5th Kentucky Rifle Regiments and the 1st Volunteers continued to hold in the town. At the cost of 5 killed and 40 wounded, they had killed or wounded all but 1 member of the gun crews manning the 3 cannon in the center of the British line, 13 of the 16-man howitzer crew, as well as many infantry, but they were finally running out of ammunition after having repulsed three assaults. Winchester was urged by Procter to order his remaining men to surrender; otherwise they would all be killed and Frenchtown burned down. Procter demanded an unconditional surrender and refused Winchester's counter-proposals since Winchester was already his prisoner. Major George Madison, an American officer still on the battlefield, persuaded Procter to accept a surrender on the condition that all would be protected as prisoners of war. When they saw the British waving a white flag, the Kentucky riflemen thought it meant a call for a truce. Unfortunately, a British officer gave them an order to surrender from General Winchester. They refused and said they would fight to the death rather than trust the Indians, but George Madison issued a formal declaration of surrender after about three more hours of fighting. The British made several attempts to persuade the Indians to destroy Frenchtown, but the Potawatomi refused to allow this since they had given the land to the settlers and did not wish to inflict more harm on them. River Raisin Massacre. Immediately following the American surrender, some of the Kentuckians argued with their officers that ""they would rather die on the field"" than surrender, fearing that their surrender would lead to their eventual deaths anyway at the hands of their captors. However, the fighting ceased immediately following their surrender. At least 300 Americans were initially estimated as killed, and over 500 were taken as prisoners. Procter, unsure of what do with so many prisoners, wanted to make a hasty retreat in case that William Henry Harrison would send more troops to the area once word of Winchester's defeat reached him. The uninjured prisoners were marched north and then across the frozen Detroit River to Fort Malden, but the wounded prisoners unable to walk were left behind at Frenchtown. Procter had to wait another day for sleds to arrive to transport the wounded American prisoners, but he feared that more Americans were on the way from the south. However, on the morning of January 23, the Native Americans began robbing and pillaging the injured Americans. Any American able to walk was marched away toward Fort Malden, while many of the more severely injured were left behind and simply murdered. The buildings that housed the wounded were set on fire. Those that could escape the burning buildings were murdered as they tried to flee, and those unable to move died in the fires. While the prisoners were marched north toward Detroit, those unable to keep up with the march were murdered as well. An account from a survivor read, ""The road was for miles strewed with the mangled bodies."" Estimates of the numbers of wounded killed by Native Americans range from 30 to as high as 100. The needless slaughter of the American wounded, which became known as the River Raisin Massacre, so horrified contemporary Americans that it overshadowed the actual battle and word of it spread throughout the country. The massacre was particularly devastating for the state of Kentucky, which supplied many soldiers that fell during the Battle of Frenchtown and subsequent massacre. The rallying cry ""Remember the River Raisin"" prompted many Kentuckians to enlist immediately for service in the war. Aftermath. While it is not known how many soldiers died during the First Battle of the River Raisin on January 18, 1813, official counts list 397 Americans killed and 27 wounded during the January 22 conflict. Also, figures of those that were killed during the subsequent River Raisin Massacre are also unknown but estimates are as high as 100 killed. Two weeks after the battle, Brigadier General James Winchester reported that 547 of his men were taken as prisoners and only 33 escaped the battlefield. Many of those that were held as prisoners were detained at Fort Malden until the end of the war over two years later. Winchester himself was imprisoned for over a year before being released and reassigned to service. James Winchester largely bore the responsibility for the devastating loss at Frenchtown. His ill-prepared defensive planning following the successful First Battle of the River Raisin led to the defeat of his army and the high number of deaths his column suffered. Had Winchester retreated to the Maumee River to rejoin with William Henry Harrison's column, they could have strengthened their numbers and marched back to Frenchtown with the necessary troops and preparedness to fight the British and Native Americans. Instead, Winchester remained in Frenchtown with his small force despite advanced knowledge of a British and Native American counterattack. He was also unaware that Harrison's troops were on their way and would arrive shortly. During the Second Battle of the River Raisin, Winchester was captured rather early into the battle and surrendered his army at the urging of Henry Procter. While his army suffered heavy losses at the start of the surprise attack, the Kentuckians regrouped and had fought off three waves of British lines to protect their camp, although they were very low on ammunition when the order of surrender came from Winchester. Had the Americans prolonged the battle long enough for Harrison's column to arrive at Frenchtown, the outcome of the battle could have changed. The British reported that only 24 were killed and 161 wounded, but the Native American casualties are not known to have been documented. Immediately following the battle, Procter, fearing that William Henry Harrison would send more Americans to Frenchtown, made a hasty retreat slightly north to Brownstown. Harrison was forced to call off his winter campaign to retake Detroit, which remained in British hands until an American victory at the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813 allowed for the recapture of Detroit. As for Frenchtown, it remained a stronghold for the British until Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson from Kentucky led his cavalry to liberate Frenchtown on September 27, 1813. The retreating British were pushed back into Upper Canada defeated at the Battle of the Thames on October 5. Three currently active battalions of the Regular Army (1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf and 4-3 Inf) perpetuate the lineage of the old 17th and 19th Infantry Regiments, both of which had elements in action during fighting at Frenchtown. [[File:Cemetery, Military Monument-3 cropped.jpg|thumb|Names of some of the American officers who died at Frenchtown (Kentucky War Memorial Frankfort, KY)]] Nine counties in Kentucky were later named for officers who fought in the Battle of Frenchtown. Of the following list, only Bland Ballard survived the battle. Several streets in Monroe near the battle site have been named in honor of those that fought in the Battle of Frenchtown, including Kentucky Avenue and Winchester Street. To further honor the heroism of those from Kentucky that fought in the Battle of Frenchtown, the state of Michigan erected a monument in downtown Monroe in 1904. The monument is located on the west side of South Monroe Street (M-125) at the corner of 7th Street. Also, on this site lay the unidentified remains of some of the victims who died in the battle and the subsequent massacre. The core area where the battle took place was listed as a Michigan Historic Site on February 18, 1956. The location of the site is bounded by North Dixie Highway, the River Raisin, Detroit Avenue, and Mason Run Creek. The site was recognized nationally when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 1982. The River Raisin National Battlefield Park was signed into law on March 30, 2009 with the passing of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act. Once the park receives the funding necessary for completion, it will be included on the National Park Service as one of only four National Battlefield Parks in the United States. "

wikipedia-34664702," Murder of Jimmy Mizen  The murder of Jimmy Mizen took place on 10 May 2008 when the 16-year-old schoolboy was murdered in Lee Green, London. A 19-year-old youth, Jake Fahri, was arrested and convicted in March 2009 of his murder. Background. Mizen (9 May 1992 – 10 May 2008) was the son of Barry and Margaret Mizen. He was their sixth son and eighth child. Mizen was 16 years old, tall and . He lived in Lee Green and attended St Thomas More Catholic Comprehensive School in Eltham, south east London. The Mizen family had had previous dealings with Jake Fahri. The culmination of these events led to the incident in which Jimmy Mizen was murdered, in which Harry Mizen, Jimmy's brother, had been mugged a total of 2 times by Jake Fahri over the course of 6 years, prior to the death of Jimmy.  Harry had turned Jake over to the school on the first count, with Jake proposing to never succumbing to mugging again, and after 5 years, Jake seemed to recognise Harry, mugging him a second time before he was turned over to the police.  At the Bakery years later, Jake recognised Harry, however, set his sights on Jimmy - inevitably causing his death. Incident. At approximately 11.30 on the morning of Saturday, 10 May 2008, a day after his sixteenth birthday, Jimmy Mizen was inside the Three Cooks Bakery in Burnt Ash Hill, south London, with his brother Harry. Jake Fahri, 19, of Milborough Crescent, Lee, entered the shop and an altercation began when Jimmy Mizen stood up to threats being made against him by Fahri.  Fahri then re-entered the shop with a metal-framed advertising sign and started poking Jimmy Mizen with it. Mizen held onto the sign, and in panic Fahri reached for a 12 inch (30 cm) hot glass dish from the counter and threw it at Jimmy Mizen. Shattering on his chin, a one-and-a-half-inch glass shard pierced his neck and severed vital blood vessels. According to witnesses Fahri exited the bakery with a triumphant grin on his face.  Mizen managed to stagger into the rear of the bakery, and into a cupboard, to shield himself from who he thought was Jake returning, where his older brother Tommy, (27 at the time), found him. Jimmy Mizen collapsed in his brother's arms. Their mother Margaret arrived soon after and fainted at sight of her son. She regained consciousness soon after, and called her husband (Barry Mizen) who arrived an hour later, only to find his son had died. Arrest, investigation and trial. Fahri handed himself into police custody three days later after the attack. In police recordings of his interviews, Fahri commented: ""Someone has died because of me. I didn't mean it, I didn't mean to kill him. Fahri said he panicked when he thought he was losing grip on the advertising sign. Fahri, now crying said: ""I can feel it coming out of my hands so I panicked. I looked to my left. There was a tray there. I picked it up and threw it. I didn't mean to hit him, I didn't. I just threw it. I thought he would put his hands up so he'd let go of the sign. All I wanted to do is, I didn't want him to hit me with the sign, so I picked up the dish. I didn't think it would smash and I threw it and it hit him and it hit him. I didn't mean... I didn't mean it to... for that to happen... I didn't mean to hit him. didn't want to hurt him, didn't want to. I might have been lippy at the start, you know, but I didn't mean it to happen."" He said he ran off when Jimmy Mizen let go of the sign. He was challenged by Jimmy's older brother Tommy, 27, outside the shop. Fahri said he only learned of Mizen's death when his mother rang him to explain what had happened. Fahri said he went in the shop for a sandwich. He changed his mind and turning around saw Mizen was standing in his way. Fahri said: ""I've made a step and looked at him to say, you know I'm trying to get past. I didn't get no reaction so I've brushed past him and he's obviously, he took offence to that, and he said 'Don't touch me'."" He then challenged the Mizens's to go outside but re-entered after seeing Harry on the phone summoning Tommy to help. Fahri was remanded in custody and stood trial for the murder of Jimmy Mizen at the Central Criminal Court on March 11, 2009 before Mr Justice Calvert-Smith and a jury. At his trial, Fahri admitted throwing the glass dish but denied murder. Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, said: ""A trivial incident, brought about by the defendant's rudeness, escalated into something horrific. The defendant reached for any and every available weapon with which to attack the Mizen brothers. The whole incident lasted no more than three minutes - three minutes of absolute madness on the part of this defendant."" Pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift told the court that Jimmy Mizen died from loss of blood. A glass shard had severed the carotid artery and jugular veins which were both 0.4in (1 cm) below the skin near the jaw.  However, the jury rejected Fahri's version of events and found him guilty of murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of fourteen years. The Jimmy Mizen Foundation. The Mizen family opened a cafe in Hither Green in 2010, a mile away from the bakery where Jimmy Mizen was killed. The ""Cafe of Good Hope"" is next door to the headquarters of the Jimmy Mizen Foundation. The cafe is run by Jimmy Mizen's older brother Billy, who is a trained patissier. Two other brothers Bobby, and Tommy are also involved in the running of the cafe. All proceeds from the cafe go towards running various charity and community projects and for local youngsters to get work experience at the cafe. In 2010, “The Tablet” named the Mizen family as among Britain’s most influential Roman Catholics. "
wikipedia-3965729," Tomcraft  Tomcraft (born Thomas Brückner, 12 June 1975) is a German DJ and producer. He specializes in progressive house and progressive trance music and is better known for having created the tracks ""Loneliness"" and ""Prosac"", working alongside Eniac. Tomcraft began working as a DJ in Munich in 1994, shifting between techno and the emerging progressive trance style. The following year, he released his first track, ""This Is No House"". He first met Eniac in 1996, and the two immediately started producing music together, beginning with ""Viva"". The same year yielded the track ""Prosac"", but this did not achieve success until it was re-released in 2001. For a decade or so, he worked alongside fellow German producer Eniac as an explosive studio team, steadily building hype and acclaim with regular releases on the country’s famous Kosmo Recordings amongst others.  2002 was also the year Tomcraft released ""Loneliness"", a progressive vocal track that topped the charts in the United Kingdom in May 2003. Following his breakthrough hit, they parted ways with Eniac following some disagreements, and Tomcraft set about building his reputation in the underground scene further – with the launch of Great Stuff and subsequent signings of such a talents as Lutzenkirchen, Coburn, Oliver Koletzki, The Egg and Ramon Tapia. 2005 saw the launch of Craft Music, a new outlet for his productions with all other signed releases treated to a remix by the man himself – with the label undergoing a major relaunch in 2010 to bring it back to the forefront of house and techno music. In the interim, he released several other big club smashes, including Prozac and Overdose, with regular releases ensuring his name remained unforgotten and an impressive 4 artist albums released across the space of 6 years showing that he was no mere 12” artist. Having resolved their disagreements, he is now once again working with Eniac on new material, with A Place Called Soul one of their first reunited efforts and a new artist album scheduled for 2011. “It’s always something special when we work together” he beams of his colleague, who has moved back from Berlin to Munich so that they can work on new music day in, day out. Meanwhile, he’s also been working regularly with English talent Tim Healey (formerly known as 'Coburn'), staying with his family in Brighton for a week at a time and working solidly on new material. His collaborations with vocalists over the years included workings with such a stars as Jimmy Pop (Bloodhound Gang's singer), German soul sensation Xavier Naidoo, the USA’s venerable Tommie Sunshine and local rapper Sido, his mind being always open to new and disparate influences and styles and his studio forever expanding with new bits of kit and vintage machinery. Naturally his DJ career exploded upon the mega-success of that single, with highlights over the years including playing to 1.3 million people at Berlin’s Love Parade, Japan’s famous Fujirock Festival, major festivals in Brazil, and some of the coolest clubs in Singapore, Tokyo, Los Angeles, São Paulo, Rio, Cape Town, San Francisco, all over Europe, Poland, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Russia (where he remains a regular fixture). His sound has morphed over the years from trance into electro house and now since 2007 into a balance of those influences with a progressive house backbone, returning to the melodic sound that he came from originally. Tomcraft has released four albums to date, ""All I Got"" (2001), ""MUC"" (2003), ""HyperSexyConscious"" (2006) and ""For The Queen"" (2007), all on Kosmo Records. His latest album, ""For The Queen"", was a collaboration with Tobias David Lützenkirchen from their Great Stuff label, and while similar in style with previous Tomcraft releases, it is distinctive in a more narrative way, with less of the dance floor dimension of his previous works; he calls it a ""feature album"" and it is rich with collaborations and two covers.

wikipedia-56480," Q fever  Q fever is a disease caused by infection with ""Coxiella burnetii"", a bacterium that affects humans and other animals. This organism is uncommon, but may be found in cattle, sheep, goats and other domestic mammals, including cats and dogs. The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small cell variant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen of infected animals. Rarely, the disease is tick borne. The incubation period is 9–40 days. A human being can be infected by a single bacterium. The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogen. History. It was first described by Edward Holbrook Derrick in abattoir workers in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The ""Q"" stands for ""query"" and was applied at a time when the causative agent was unknown; it was chosen over suggestions of ""abattoir fever"" and ""Queensland rickettsial fever"", to avoid directing negative connotations at either the cattle industry or the state of Queensland. The pathogen of Q fever was discovered in 1937, when Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Mavis Freeman isolated the bacterium from one of Derrick’s patients. It was originally identified as a species of ""Rickettsia"". H.R. Cox and Gordon Davis isolated it from ticks in Montana, USA in 1938. It is a zoonotic disease whose most common animal reservoirs are cattle, sheep and goats. ""Coxiella burnetii"" is no longer regarded as closely related to Rickettsiae, but as similar to ""Legionella"" and ""Francisella"", and is a proteobacterium. Signs and symptoms. Incubation period is usually two to three weeks. The most common manifestation is mild flu-like symptoms with abrupt onset of fever, malaise, profuse perspiration, severe headache, myalgia (muscle pain), joint pain, loss of appetite, upper respiratory problems, dry cough, pleuritic pain, chills, confusion and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The fever lasts approximately seven to 14 days. Approximately half of infected individuals exhibit no symptoms. During its course, the disease can progress to an atypical pneumonia, which can result in a life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), whereby such symptoms usually occur during the first four to five days of infection. Less often, Q fever causes (granulomatous) hepatitis, which may be asymptomatic or becomes symptomatic with malaise, fever, liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Whereas transaminase values are often elevated, jaundice is uncommon. Retinal vasculitis is a rare manifestation of Q fever. The chronic form of Q fever is virtually identical to inflammation of the inner lining of the heart (endocarditis), which can occur months or decades following the infection. It is usually fatal if untreated. However, with appropriate treatment, the mortality falls to around 10%. Clinical signs in animals. Cattle, goats and sheep are most commonly infected, and can serve as a reservoir for the bacteria. Q fever is a well recognized cause of abortions in ruminants and in pets. ""C. burnetii"" infection in dairy cattle has been well documented and its association with reproductive problems in these animals has been reported in Canada, USA, Cyprus, France, Hungary, Japan, Switzerland and West Germany. For instance, in a study published in 2008,a significant association has been shown between the herds’ seropositivity and typical clinical signs of Q Fever observed such as abortion, stillbirth, weak calves and repeat breeding. Moreover, experimental inoculation of ""C. burnetii"" in cattle induced not only respiratory disorders and cardiac failures (myocarditis) but also frequent abortions and irregular repeat breedings. Appearance and incidence. The pathogenic agent is to be found everywhere except New Zealand. The bacterium is extremely sustainable and virulent: a single organism is able to cause an infection. The common way of infection is inhalation of contaminated dust, contact with contaminated milk, meat, wool and particularly birthing products. Ticks can transfer the pathogenic agent to other animals. Transfer between humans seems extremely rare and has so far been described in very few cases. Some studies have shown more men to be affected than women, which may be attributed to different employment rates in typical professions. ""At risk"" occupations include, but are not limited to: Diagnosis. Diagnosis is usually based on serology (looking for an antibody response) rather than looking for the organism itself. Serology allows to detect chronic infection as high antibody levels are found against the virulent form of the bacterium. Molecular detection of bacterial DNA is increasingly used. Culture is technically difficult and not routinely available in most microbiology laboratories. Q fever can cause endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which may require transoesophageal echocardiography to diagnose. Q fever hepatitis manifests as an elevation of ALT and AST, but a definitive diagnosis is only possible on liver biopsy, which shows the characteristic fibrin ring granulomas. Treatment. Treatment of the acute Q fever with antibiotics is very effective and should take place in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist. Commonly used are doxycycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and hydroxychloroquine. The chronic form is more difficult to treat and can require up to four years of treatment with doxycycline and quinolones or doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine. Q fever in pregnancy is especially difficult to treat because doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are contraindicated in pregnancy. The preferred treatment is five weeks of co-trimoxazole. Prevention. Protection is offered by Q-Vax, a whole-cell, inactivated vaccine developed by an Australian vaccine manufacturing company CSL. The intradermal vaccination is composed of killed ""Coxiella burnetii"" organisms. Skin and blood tests should be done before vaccination to identify pre-existing immunity, because vaccinating subjects who already have an immunity can result in a severe local reaction. After a single dose of vaccine, protective immunity lasts for many years. Revaccination is not generally required. Annual screening is typically recommended. In 2001, Australia introduced a national Q fever vaccination program for people working in ""at risk"" occupations. The Soviet Union had earlier developed a killed vaccine, but its side effects prevented its licensing abroad. Preliminary results suggest vaccination of animals may be a method of control. Published trials proved that use of a registered Phase I vaccine (Coxevac) in infected farms is a tool of major interest to manage or prevent early or late abortion, repeat breeding, anoestrus, silent oestrus, metritis and decreases in milk yield when ""C. burnetii"" is the major cause of these problems. Biological warfare. Q fever has been described as a possible biological weapon. The United States investigated Q fever as a potential biological warfare agent in the 1950s, with eventual standardization as agent OU. At Fort Detrick and Dugway Proving Ground, human trials were conducted on Whitecoat volunteers to determine the median infective dose (18 MICLD50/person i.h.) and course of infection. As a standardized biological, it was manufactured in large quantities at Pine Bluff Arsenal, with 5,098 gallons in the arsenal in bulk at the time of demilitarization in 1970. Q fever is a category ""B"" agent. It can be contagious, and is very stable in aerosols in a wide range of temperatures. Q fever microorganisms may survive on surfaces up to 60 days. It is considered a good agent in part because its ID50 (number of bacilli needed to infect 50% of individuals) is considered to be 1, making it the lowest known to man. In popular Culture. A mention of Q fever was important in one of the early Dr. Kildare films (1939, ""Calling Dr. Kildare""). Kildare's mentor Dr. Gillespie (Lionel Barrymore) tires of his protege working fruitlessly on ""exotic diagnoses"" (""I think it's Q fever!"") and sends him to work in a neighborhood clinic instead. Q fever was also highlighted in an episode of the U.S. television medical drama House (""The Dig"", Season 7, Episode 18). "
wikipedia-682454," Mensch  In Yiddish, ""mentsh"" roughly means ""a good person."" The word has migrated as a loanword into American English, where a ""mensch"" is a particularly good person, similar to a ""stand-up guy"", a person with the qualities one would hope for in a friend or trusted colleague. ""Mentshlekhkeyt"" (Yiddish מענטשלעכקייט, German ""Menschlichkeit"") are the properties which make a person a ""mensch"". During the Age of Enlightenment in Germany the term ""Humanität"", in the philosophical sense of compassion, was used to describe what characterizes a ""better human being"" in Humanism. The concept goes back to Cicero's ""Humanitas"" and was literally translated into the German word ""Menschlichkeit"" and then adapted into ""mentsh"" in Yiddish language use. "
wikipedia-12556575," Dropped A tuning  Dropped A tuning is an alternate tuning for a 7 string guitar where the lowest string is tuned down (""dropped"") from the standard B by one whole step to A or on a 6 string guitar where the strings are tuned to AEADF♯B. This is a ""drop 1"" tuning in the key of B (i.e. tune the whole guitar down a perfect fourth from standard tuning, then tune the 6th string a whole step down). As a result, it uses the same fingering as drop D tuning and drop C tuning.  An alternate dropped A tuning utilizes a guitar tuned to E Standard with the 6th string dropped to a low A, resulting in AADGBE with the 6th and 5th strings an octave apart.  Another variation of this tuning is AEADGB, which imitates a 7 on a six-string, excluding the high E.  Another dropped A tuning is AGCFAD (""drop perfect fourth in the key of the D"", i.e. whole guitar is tuned down one step, then the lowest string is dropped to A). "

wikipedia-946584," Coordination game  In game theory, coordination games are a class of games with multiple pure strategy Nash equilibria in which players choose the same or corresponding strategies. Coordination games are a formalization of the idea of a coordination problem, which is widespread in the social sciences, including economics, meaning situations in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. A common application is the choice of technological standards. For a classic example of a coordination game, consider the 2-player, 2-strategy game, with the payoff matrix shown on the right (Fig. 1). If this game is a coordination game, then the following inequalities in payoffs hold for player 1 (rows): A > B, D > C, and for player 2 (columns): a > c, d > b. In this game the strategy profiles {Left, Up} and {Right, Down} are pure Nash equilibria, marked in gray. This setup can be extended for more than two strategies (strategies are usually sorted so that the Nash equilibria are in the diagonal from top left to bottom right), as well as for a game with more than two players. Examples. A typical case for a coordination game is choosing the sides of the road upon which to drive, a social standard which can save lives if it is widely adhered to. In a simplified example, assume that two drivers meet on a narrow dirt road. Both have to swerve in order to avoid a head-on collision. If both execute the same swerving maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide. In the payoff matrix in Fig. 2, successful passing is represented by a payoff of 10, and a collision by a payoff of 0. In this case there are two pure Nash equilibria: either both swerve to the left, or both swerve to the right. In this example, it doesn't matter ""which"" side both players pick, as long as they both pick the same. Both solutions are Pareto efficient. This is not true for all coordination games, as the ""pure coordination game"" in Fig. 3 shows. Pure (or common interest) coordination is the game where the players both prefer the same Nash equilibrium outcome, here both players prefer partying over both staying at home to watch TV. The {Party, Party} outcome Pareto dominates the {Home, Home} outcome, just as both Pareto dominate the other two outcomes, {Party, Home} and {Home, Party}. This is different in another type of coordination game commonly called battle of the sexes (or conflicting interest coordination), as seen in Fig. 4. In this game both players prefer engaging in the same activity over going alone, but their preferences differ over which activity they should engage in. Player 1 prefers that they both party while player 2 prefers that they both stay at home. Finally, the stag hunt game in Fig. 5 shows a situation in which both players (hunters) can benefit if they cooperate (hunting a stag). However, cooperation might fail, because each hunter has an alternative which is safer because it does not require cooperation to succeed (hunting a hare). This example of the potential conflict between safety and social cooperation is originally due to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Coordination games also have mixed strategy Nash equilibria. In the generic coordination game above, a mixed Nash equilibrium is given by probabilities p = (d-b)/(a+d-b-c) to play Up and 1-p to play Down for player 1, and q = (D-C)/(A+D-B-C) to play Left and 1-q to play Right for player 2. Since d > b and d-b  A and C > D for row-player 1 (with lowercase analogues for column-player 2). {Down, Left} and {Up, Right} are the two pure Nash equilibria. Chicken also requires that A > C, so a change from {Up, Left} to {Up, Right} improves player 2's payoff but reduces player 1's payoff, introducing conflict. This counters the standard coordination game setup, where all unilateral changes in a strategy lead to either mutual gain or mutual loss. The concept of anti-coordination games has been extended to multi-player situation. A crowding game is defined as a game where each player's payoff is non-increasing over the number of other players choosing the same strategy (i.e., a game with negative network externalities). For instance, a driver could take U.S. Route 101 or Interstate 280 from San Francisco to San Jose. While 101 is shorter, 280 is considered more scenic, so drivers might have different preferences between the two independent of the traffic flow. But each additional car on either route will slightly increase the drive time on that route, so additional traffic creates negative network externalities, and even scenery-minded drivers might opt to take 101 if 280 becomes too crowded. A congestion game is a crowding game in networks. The minority game is a game where the only objective for all players is to be part of smaller of two groups. A well-known example of the minority game is the El Farol Bar problem proposed by W. Brian Arthur. A hybrid form of coordination and anti-coordination is the discoordination game, where one player's incentive is to coordinate while the other player tries to avoid this. Discoordination games have no pure Nash equilibria. In Figure 1, choosing payoffs so that A > B, D  d, creates a discoordination game. In each of the four possible states either player 1 or player 2 are better off by switching their strategy, so the only Nash equilirium is mixed. The canonical example of a discoordination game is the matching pennies game. "
wikipedia-772201," Lechia Gdańsk  Lechia Gdańsk () is a Polish football club based in Gdańsk, Poland. The club's name comes from Lechia, a poetic name for Poland. The club was founded by people expelled from Lwów, who were supporters of Lechia Lwów. Founded in 1945, Lechia was a powerhouse in Polish football during the mid-1950s. Next decades were lean, the team returned to form in early the 1980s, winning a Cup of Poland, a Super Cup, and playing in the UEFA Cup Winners Cup, where it lost to Juventus F.C.. In May 2008 the club was promoted again to the Polish top division. History. The club was founded in 1945 in Gdańsk named at the time ""BOP Baltia Gdańsk"". In 1946 the club name was changed to ""Lechia"". The first historic promotion to the Polish Ekstraklasa occurred in 1948. After a season in the Polish Ekstraklasa, Lechia was relegated in 1949 to the Second Division. The club again changed its name to ""Budowlani"", advancing to the Polish Ekstraklasa in 1951 and being relegated again in 1953 for a season. In the 1956 season, Lechia finished 3rd in the Polish Ekstraklasa, which is the greatest achievement in the club's history so far. Lechia was relegated for the third time after the 1962-1963 season of the Polish Ekstraklasa, and then was relegatged from the Second Division in the 1966-1967 season. They returned to the Second Division in the 1972-1973 season, but was short lived as they were relegated after the 1981-1982 season. In spite of that the 1980s have been regarded as the rebirth of the club. Lechia was promoted to the Polish 2nd Division in the 1982-1983 season. In 1983 the club achieved his biggest successes so far: first by winning the Polish Cup with a 2-1 victory over Piast Gliwice in the final and later by winning the Polish Supercup. In 1984 Lechia finally managed to get promoted to Ekstraklasa after 21 years of absence. The club played in the top league 4 years but in 1988 suffered a decline in form which resulted in another relegation to second division. Lechia normally relegated from West (Zachodnia) Group of second division bu merged with Olimpia Poznań, was Ekstraklasa club, and became Lechia/Olimpia Gdańsk in 1995 summer. Lechia/Olimpia Gdańsk relegated to second division in 1995-96 season and third division in 1996-97 one. After relegation to second division Olimpia left from the merger in 1996 but Lechia kept Lechia/Olimpia name. After end of 1997-98 season Lechia merged with Polonia Gdańsk, was second division club, and became Lechia/Polonia Gdańsk in 1998 summer. Lechia/Polonia merger was broken up after relegation to third division. Lechia began from Gdansk 4 Group of Klasa A, which was sixth level of Polish league in 2001-2002. Lechia promoted to second division in 2005 after successive four promotions as champions: To Group Gdansk 2 of Klasa okręgowa in 2002, Pomerania (Pomorska) Group of fourth league in 2003, Second Group (Grupa II) of Third League in 2004. Lechia finished second division (now First League) as 10th in 2005-2006 season and 5th in 2006-2007 one.  At the end of the 2007/08 season Lechia managed to get promoted to extraklasa again as champions. On 28 January 2009 the members of OSP Lechia Gdańsk signed a document that formed the new Lechia Gdańsk S.A. On 30 July 2013, Lechia draws for 2-2 against FC Barcelona; the Spanish team risks to lose the friendly match and it was also the debut match of the Brazilian Neymar.  Goal Scorers: The Fans. In the 1980s many of the club's fans were active in the Solidarity movement which was fighting the communist regime in Poland. It is therefore not unusual to see anticommunist slogans or phrases like ""we make history"" on the stands.  They have a friendship with Śląsk Wrocław and Wisła Kraków fans (Three Kings of Great Cities, ). Stadium. PGE Arena Gdańsk is the home stadium of Lechia Gdańsk. The PGE Arena Gdańsk, previously called the Baltic Arena, is a football stadium in Gdańsk, Poland. It is used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Lechia Gdańsk. The Stadium is located on ul. Pokoleń Lechii Gdańsk (""Generations of Lechia Gdańsk street"") in the northern part of the city (Letnica district). The capacity of the stands is 43,615 spectators, all seated and roofed. PGE Arena Gdańsk is the largest arena in Ekstraklasa and the third largest in the country (after National Stadium and Silesia Stadium). Construction of the stadium started in 2008 and was completed mid-2011. The opening match was between Lechia Gdańsk and Cracovia and ended with 1–1 draw. The first international match, Poland - Germany, took place on 6 September 2011 and ended 2-2. The match was relocated from Warsaw because the National Stadium was not ready. PGE Arena is used by Lechia Gdańsk since 'the White-and-Green' relocated there form MOSiR Stadium. The stadium was also one of the designated venues for the finals of Euro 2012. It hosted four matches during the tournament. Three matches in Group C and one quarterfinal were played here. Since 2010 the official name of the stadium is PGE Arena Gdańsk on the basis of a sponsorship agreement with Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE Group). "
wikipedia-175461," Pseudo-anglicism  Pseudo-anglicisms are words in languages other than English which were borrowed from English but are used in a way native English speakers would not readily recognize or understand. Pseudo-anglicisms often take the form of compound words, combining elements of multiple English words to create a new word that appears to be English but is unrecognisable to a native speaker of English. It is also common for a genuine English word to be used to mean something completely different from its original meaning. Pseudo-anglicisms are related to false friends or false cognates. Many speakers of a language which employs pseudo-anglicisms believe that the relevant words are genuine anglicisms and can be used in English, which may cause misunderstandings. When many English words are incorporated into many languages, language enthusiasts and purists often look down on this phenomenon, terming it (depending on the importing language) Denglisch, Franglais or similar neologisms.

wikipedia-29192," Space elevator  A space elevator is a proposed type of space transportation system. Its main component is a ribbon-like cable (also called a tether) anchored to the surface and extending into space. It is designed to permit vehicle transport along the cable from a planetary surface, such as the Earth's, directly into space or orbit, without the use of large rockets. An Earth-based space elevator would consist of a cable with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end in space beyond geostationary orbit (35,800 km altitude). The competing forces of gravity, which is stronger at the lower end, and the outward/upward centrifugal force, which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth. Once deployed, the tether would be ascended repeatedly by mechanical means to orbit, and descended to return to the surface from orbit. The concept for a space elevator was first published in 1895 by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. His proposal was for a free-standing tower reaching from the surface of Earth to the height of geostationary orbit. Like all buildings, Tsiolkovsky's structure would be under compression, supporting its weight from below. Since 1959, most ideas for space elevators have focused on purely tensile structures, with the weight of the system held up from above. In the tensile concepts, a space tether reaches from a large mass (the counterweight) beyond geostationary orbit to the ground. This structure is held in tension between Earth and the counterweight like an upside-down plumb bob. Space elevators have also sometimes been referred to as ""beanstalks"", ""space bridges"", ""space lifts"", ""space ladders"", ""skyhooks"", ""orbital towers"", or ""orbital elevators"". On Earth, with its relatively strong gravity, current technology is not capable of manufacturing tether materials that are sufficiently strong and light to build a space elevator. However, recent concepts for a space elevator are notable for their plans to use carbon nanotube or boron nitride nanotube based materials as the tensile element in the tether design. The measured strength of these molecules is high compared to their densities and they hold promise as materials to make an Earth-based space elevator possible. The concept is also applicable to other planets and celestial bodies. For locations in the solar system with weaker gravity than Earth's (such as the Moon or Mars), the strength-to-density requirements are not as great for tether materials. Currently available materials (such as Kevlar) are strong and light enough that they could be used as the tether material for elevators there. History. Early concepts. The key concept of the space elevator appeared in 1895 when Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky was inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris. He considered a similar tower that reached all the way into space and was built from the ground up to the altitude of 35,790 kilometers, the height of geostationary orbit. He noted that the top of such a tower would be orbiting Earth in a geostationary orbit. Objects would attain orbital velocity as they rode up the tower, and an object released at the tower's top would also have the velocity necessary to remain in geostationary orbit. Tsiolkovsky's conceptual tower was a compression structure, while modern concepts call for a tensile structure (or ""tether""). 20th century. Building a compression structure from the ground up proved an unrealistic task as there was no material in existence with enough compressive strength to support its own weight under such conditions. In 1959 another Russian scientist, Yuri N. Artsutanov, suggested a more feasible proposal. Artsutanov suggested using a geostationary satellite as the base from which to deploy the structure downward. By using a counterweight, a cable would be lowered from geostationary orbit to the surface of Earth, while the counterweight was extended from the satellite away from Earth, keeping the cable constantly over the same spot on the surface of the Earth. Artsutanov's idea was introduced to the Russian-speaking public in an interview published in the Sunday supplement of ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" in 1960, but was not available in English until much later. He also proposed tapering the cable thickness so that the stress in the cable was constant. This gives a thinner cable at ground level that becomes thicker up towards GSO. Both the tower and cable ideas were proposed in the quasi-humorous ""Ariadne"" column in ""New Scientist"", December 24, 1964. In 1966, Isaacs, Vine, Bradner and Bachus, four American engineers, reinvented the concept, naming it a ""Sky-Hook,"" and published their analysis in the journal ""Science"". They decided to determine what type of material would be required to build a space elevator, assuming it would be a straight cable with no variations in its cross section, and found that the strength required would be twice that of any then-existing material including graphite, quartz, and diamond. In 1975 an American scientist, Jerome Pearson, reinvented the concept yet again, publishing his analysis in the journal Acta Astronautica. He designed a tapered cross section that would be better suited to building the elevator. The completed cable would be thickest at the geostationary orbit, where the tension was greatest, and would be narrowest at the tips to reduce the amount of weight per unit area of cross section that any point on the cable would have to bear. He suggested using a counterweight that would be slowly extended out to 144,000 kilometers (90,000 miles, almost half the distance to the Moon) as the lower section of the elevator was built. Without a large counterweight, the upper portion of the cable would have to be longer than the lower due to the way gravitational and centrifugal forces change with distance from Earth. His analysis included disturbances such as the gravitation of the Moon, wind and moving payloads up and down the cable. The weight of the material needed to build the elevator would have required thousands of Space Shuttle trips, although part of the material could be transported up the elevator when a minimum strength strand reached the ground or be manufactured in space from asteroidal or lunar ore. In 1979, space elevators were introduced to a broader audience with the simultaneous publication of Arthur C. Clarke's novel, ""The Fountains of Paradise"", in which engineers construct a space elevator on top of a mountain peak in the fictional island country of ""Taprobane"" (loosely based on Sri Lanka, albeit moved south to the Equator), and Charles Sheffield's first novel, ""The Web Between the Worlds"", also featuring the building of a space elevator. Three years later, in Robert A. Heinlein's 1982 novel ""Friday"" the principal character makes use of the ""Nairobi Beanstalk"" in the course of her travels. In Kim Stanley Robinson's 1993 novel ""Red Mars"", colonists build a space elevator on Mars that allows both for more colonists to arrive and also for natural resources mined there to be able to leave for Earth. In David Gerrold's 2000 novel, ""Jumping Off The Planet"", a family excursion up the Ecuador ""beanstalk"" is actually a child-custody kidnapping. Gerrold's book also examines some of the industrial applications of a mature elevator technology. In a biological version, Joan Slonczewski's novel ""The Highest Frontier"" depicts a college student ascending a space elevator constructed of self-healing cables of anthrax bacilli. The engineered bacteria can regrow the cables when severed by space debris. 21st century. After the development of carbon nanotubes in the 1990s, engineer David Smitherman of NASA/Marshall's Advanced Projects Office realized that the high strength of these materials might make the concept of an orbital skyhook feasible, and put together a workshop at the Marshall Space Flight Center, inviting many scientists and engineers to discuss concepts and compile plans for an elevator to turn the concept into a reality. The publication he edited, compiling information from the workshop, ""Space Elevators: An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium"", provides an introduction to the state of the technology at the time (1999), and summarizes the findings. Another American scientist, Bradley C. Edwards, suggested creating a long paper-thin ribbon using a carbon nanotube composite material. He chose the wide-thin ribbon-like cross-section shape rather than earlier circular cross-section concepts because that shape would stand a greater chance of surviving impacts by meteoroids. The ribbon cross-section shape also provided large surface area for climbers to climb with simple rollers. Supported by the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, Edwards' work was expanded to cover the deployment scenario, climber design, power delivery system, orbital debris avoidance, anchor system, surviving atomic oxygen, avoiding lightning and hurricanes by locating the anchor in the western equatorial Pacific, construction costs, construction schedule, and environmental hazards. To speed space elevator development, proponents have organized several competitions, similar to the Ansari X Prize, for relevant technologies. Among them are , which organized annual competitions for climbers, ribbons and power-beaming systems from 2005 to 2009, the Robogames Space Elevator Ribbon Climbing competition, as well as NASA's Centennial Challenges program, which, in March 2005, announced a partnership with the Spaceward Foundation (the operator of Elevator:2010), raising the total value of prizes to US$400,000. The first European Space Elevator Challenge (EuSEC) to establish a climber structure took place in August 2011. In 2005, ""the LiftPort Group of space elevator companies announced that it will be building a carbon nanotube manufacturing plant in Millville, New Jersey, to supply various glass, plastic and metal companies with these strong materials. Although LiftPort hopes to eventually use carbon nanotubes in the construction of a space elevator, this move will allow it to make money in the short term and conduct research and development into new production methods."" Their announced goal was a space elevator launch in 2010. On February 13, 2006 the LiftPort Group announced that, earlier the same month, they had tested a mile of ""space-elevator tether"" made of carbon-fiber composite strings and fiberglass tape measuring 5 cm (2 in) wide and 1 mm (approx. 13 sheets of paper) thick, lifted with balloons. In 2007, held the 2007 Space Elevator games, which featured US$500,000 awards for each of the two competitions, (US$1,000,000 total) as well as an additional US$4,000,000 to be awarded over the next five years for space elevator related technologies. No teams won the competition, but a team from MIT entered the first 2-gram (0.07 oz), 100% carbon nanotube entry into the competition. Japan held an international conference in November 2008 to draw up a timetable for building the elevator. In 2008 the book ""Leaving the Planet by Space Elevator"", by Dr. Brad Edwards and Philip Ragan, was published in Japanese and entered the Japanese best seller list. This has led to a Japanese announcement of intent to build a Space Elevator at a projected price tag of a trillion yen (£5 billion/ $8 billion). In a report by Leo Lewis, Tokyo correspondent of The Times newspaper in England, plans by Shuichi Ono, chairman of the Japan Space Elevator Association, are unveiled. Lewis says: ""Japan is increasingly confident that its sprawling academic and industrial base can solve those issues, and has even put the astonishingly low price tag of a trillion yen (£5 billion/ $8 billion) on building the elevator. Japan is renowned as a global leader in the precision engineering and high-quality material production without which the idea could never be possible."" In 2011, Google was reported to be working on plans for a space elevator at its secretive Google X Lab location. Since then, Google has stated that it is not working on a space elevator. In 2012, the Obayashi Corporation announced that in 38 years it could build a space elevator using carbon nanotube technology. At 200 kilometers per hour, the design's 30-passenger climber would be able to reach the GEO level after a 7.5 day trip. No cost estimates, finance plans, or other specifics were made. This, along with timing and other factors, hinted that the announcement was made largely to provide publicity for the opening of one of the company's other projects in Tokyo. Physics of space elevators. Apparent gravitational field. A space elevator cable rotates along with the rotation of the Earth. Objects fastened to the cable will experience upward centrifugal force that opposes some of, all of, or more than, the downward gravitational force at that point. The higher up the cable, the stronger is the upward centrifugal force and the more it opposes the downward gravity. Eventually it becomes ""stronger"" than gravity above the geosynchronous level. Along the length of the cable, this (downward) ""actual"" gravity minus the (upward) centrifugal force is called the ""apparent"" gravitational field. The apparent gravitational field can be represented this way: where At some point up the cable, the two terms (downward gravity and upward centrifugal force) equal each other; objects fixed to the cable there have no weight on the cable. This occurs at the level of the stationary orbit. This level (r1) depends on the mass of the planet and its rotation rate. Setting actual gravity and centrifugal acceleration equal to each other gives: On Earth, this level is above the surface, the level of geostationary orbit. Seen from a geosynchronous station, any object dropped off the tether from a point closer to Earth will initially accelerate downward. If dropped from any point above a geosynchronous station, the object would initially accelerate up toward space. Cable section. Historically, the main technical problem has been considered the ability of the cable to hold up, with tension, the weight of itself below any particular point. The vertical point with the greatest tension on a space elevator cable is at the level of geostationary orbit, above the Earth's equator. This means that the cable material combined with its design must be strong enough to hold up the weight of its own mass from the surface up to 35,786 km. By making any cable larger in cross section at this level compared to at the surface, it can better hold up a longer length of itself. For a space elevator cable, an important design factor in addition to the material is how the cross section area tapers down from the maximum at 35,786 km to the minimum at the surface. To maximize the usable excess strength for a given amount of cable material, the cable's cross section area will need to be designed in such a way that at any given point, it is proportional to the force it has to withstand. For such an idealized design without climbers attached, without thickening at high space-junk altitudes, etc., the cross-section will follow this differential equation: or or where The value of ""g"" is given by the first equation, which yields: the variation being taken between ""r1"" (geostationary) and ""r0"" (ground). It turns out that between these two points, this quantity can be expressed simply as: formula_9, or where formula_11 is the ratio between the centrifugal force on the equator and the gravitational force. Cable material. The ""free breaking length"" can be used to compare materials: it is the length of an un-tapered cylindrical cable at which it will break under its own weight under constant gravity. For a given material, that length is ""σ/ρ/g0"". The free breaking length needed is given by the equation If one does not take into account the ""x"" factor (which reduces the strength needed by about 30%), this equation also says that the section ratio equals ""e"" (exponential one) when: If the material can support a free breaking length of only one tenth this, the section needed at a geosynchronous orbit will be ""e""10 (a factor of 22026) times the ground section. Structure. There are a variety of space elevator designs. Almost every design includes a base station, a cable, climbers, and a counterweight. Earth's rotation creates upward centrifugal force on the counterweight. The counterweight is held down by the cable while the cable is held up and taut by the counterweight. The base station anchors the whole system to the surface of the Earth. Climbers climb up and down the cable with cargo. Base station. Modern concepts for the base station/anchor are typically mobile stations, large oceangoing vessels or other mobile platforms. Mobile base stations have the advantage over the earlier stationary concepts (with land-based anchors) by being able to maneuver to avoid high winds, storms, and space debris. Oceanic anchor points are also typically in international waters, simplifying and reducing cost of negotiating territory use for the base station. Stationary land based platforms have simpler and less costly logistical access to the base. They also have an advantage of being able to be at high altitude, such as on top of mountains, or even potentially on high towers. This reduces influence from the atmosphere and how deep down into the Earth's gravity field the cable needs to extend, and so reduces the critical strength-to-density requirements for the cable material a bit (with all other design factors being equal). Cable. A space elevator cable must carry its own weight as well as the additional weight of climbers. The required strength of the cable will vary along its length. This is because at various points it has to carry the weight of the cable below, or provide a downward force to retain the cable and counterweight above. Maximum tension on a space elevator cable is at geosynchronous altitude so the cable must be thickest there and taper carefully as it approaches Earth. Any potential cable design may be characterized by the taper factor – the ratio between the cable's radius at geosynchronous altitude and at the Earth's surface. The cable must be made of a material with a large tensile strength/density ratio. For example, the Edwards space elevator design assumes a cable material with a specific strength of at least 100,000 kN/(kg/m). This value takes into consideration the entire weight of the space elevator. An untapered space elevator cable would need a material capable of sustaining a length of of its own weight ""at sea level"" to reach a geostationary altitude of without yielding. Therefore, a material with very high strength and lightness is needed. For comparison, metals like titanium, steel or aluminium alloys have breaking lengths of only 20–30 km. Modern fibre materials such as kevlar, fibreglass and carbon/graphite fibre have breaking lengths of 100–400 km. Quartz fibers have an advantage that they can be drawn to a length of hundreds of kilometers even with the present-day technology. Nanoengineered materials such as carbon nanotubes and, more recently discovered, graphene ribbons (perfect two-dimensional sheets of carbon) are expected to have breaking lengths of 5000–6000 km at sea level, and also are able to conduct electrical power. For high specific strength, carbon has advantages because it is only the 6th element in the periodic table. Carbon has comparatively few of the protons and neutrons which contribute most of the dead weight of any material. Most of the interatomic bonding forces of any element are contributed by only the outer few electrons. For carbon, the strength and stability of those bonds is high compared to the mass of the atom. The challenge in using carbon remains to extend to macroscopic sizes the production of such material that are still perfect on the microscopic scale (as microscopic defects are most responsible for material weakness). The current (2009) carbon nanotube technology allows growing tubes up to a few tens of centimeters. Climbers. A space elevator cannot be an elevator in the typical sense (with moving cables) due to the need for the cable to be significantly wider at the center than at the tips. While various designs employing moving cables have been proposed, most cable designs call for the ""elevator"" to climb up a stationary cable. Climbers cover a wide range of designs. On elevator designs whose cables are planar ribbons, most propose to use pairs of rollers to hold the cable with friction. Climbers must be paced at optimal timings so as to minimize cable stress and oscillations and to maximize throughput. Lighter climbers can be sent up more often, with several going up at the same time. This increases throughput somewhat, but lowers the mass of each individual payload. The horizontal speed of each part of the cable increases with altitude, proportional to distance from the center of the Earth, reaching orbital speed at a point 66% of the height between the surface and geostationary orbit. As a payload is lifted up a space elevator, it gains not only altitude, but horizontal speed (angular momentum) as well. This angular momentum is taken from the Earth's own rotation. As the climber ascends, it is initially moving slightly more slowly than each successive part of cable it is moving on to. This is the coriolis force, the climber ""drags"" (Westward) on the cable as it climbs. The overall effect of the centrifugal force acting on the cable causes it to constantly try to return to the energetically favourable vertical orientation, so after an object has been lifted on the cable the counterweight will swing back towards the vertical like an inverted pendulum. Space elevators and their loads will be designed so that the center of mass is always well-enough above the level of geostationary orbit to hold up the whole system. Lift and descent operations must be carefully planned so as to keep the pendulum-like motion of the counterweight around the tether point under control. When the payload has reached a level greater than 66% of the distance from the surface to GEO, the horizontal speed is enough that the payload would enter an orbit if released from the cable. The opposite process would occur for payloads descending the elevator, tilting the cable eastwards and insignificantly increasing Earth's rotation speed. It has also been proposed to use a second cable attached to a platform to lift payload up the main cable, since the lifting device would not have to deal with its own weight against Earth's gravity. Out of the many proposed theories, powering any lifting device also continues to present a challenge. Another design constraint will be the ascending speed of the climber. As geosynchronous orbit is at , assuming the climber can reach the speed of a very fast car or train of 300 km/h (180 mph) it will take 5 days to climb to geosynchronous orbit. Powering climbers. Both power and energy are significant issues for climbers—the climbers need to gain a large amount of potential energy as quickly as possible to clear the cable for the next payload. Various methods have been proposed to get that energy to the climber: Wireless energy transfer such as laser power beaming is currently considered the most likely method. Using megawatt powered free electron or solid state lasers in combination with adaptive mirrors approximately 10 m (33 ft) wide and a photovoltaic array on the climber tuned to the laser frequency for efficiency. For climber designs powered by power beaming, this efficiency is an important design goal. Unused energy must be re-radiated away with heat-dissipation systems, which add to weight. Yoshio Aoki, a professor of precision machinery engineering at Nihon University and director of the Japan Space Elevator Association, suggested including a second cable and using the conductivity of carbon nanotubes to provide power. Various mechanical means of applying power have also been proposed; such as moving, looped or vibrating cables. Counterweight. Several solutions have been proposed to act as a counterweight: Extending the cable has the advantage of some simplicity of the task and the fact that a payload that went to the end of the counterweight-cable would acquire considerable velocity relative to the Earth, allowing it to be launched into interplanetary space. Its disadvantage is the need to produce greater amounts of cable material as opposed to using anything that has mass. Related concepts. The conventional current concept of a ""Space Elevator"" has evolved from a static compressive structure reaching to the level of GEO, to the modern baseline idea of a static tensile structure anchored to the ground and extending to well above the level of GEO. In the current usage by practitioners (and in this article), a ""Space Elevator"" means the Tsiolkovsky-Artsutanov-Pearson type as considered by the International Space Elevator Consortium. This conventional type is a static structure fixed to the ground and extending into space high enough that cargo can climb the structure up from the ground to a level where simple release will put the cargo into an orbit.  Some concepts related to this modern baseline are not usually termed a ""Space Elevator"", but are similar in some way and are sometimes termed ""Space Elevator"" by their proponents. For example, Hans Moravec published an article in 1977 called ""A Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhook"" describing a concept using a rotating cable. The rotation speed would exactly match the orbital speed in such a way that the tip velocity at the lowest point was zero compared to the object to be ""elevated"". It would dynamically grapple and then ""elevate"" high flying objects to orbit or low orbiting objects to higher orbit. Other ideas use very tall compressive towers to reduce the demands on launch vehicles. The vehicle is ""elevated"" up the tower, which may extend as high as above the atmosphere, and is launched from the top. The original concept envisioned by Tsiolkovsky was a compression structure, a concept similar to an aerial mast. While such structures might reach space (100 km, 62 mi), they are unlikely to reach geostationary orbit. The concept of a Tsiolkovsky tower combined with a classic space elevator cable (reaching above the level of GEO) has been suggested. A tall tower to access near-space altitudes of has been proposed by Canadian researchers. The structure would be pneumatically supported and free standing with control systems guiding the structure's center of mass. Proposed uses include tourism and commerce, communications, wind generation and low-cost space launch. Other concepts related to a space elevator (or parts of a space elevator) include an orbital ring, a pneumatic space tower, a space fountain, a launch loop, a Skyhook, a space tether, a space hoist and the SpaceShaft. Launching into deep space. An object attached to a space elevator at a radius of approximately 53,100 km will be at escape velocity when released. Transfer orbits to the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points can be attained by release at 50,630 and 51,240 km, respectively, and transfer to lunar orbit from 50,960 km. At the end of Pearson's cable, the tangential velocity is 10.93 kilometers per second (6.79 mi/s). That is more than enough to escape Earth's gravitational field and send probes at least as far out as Jupiter. Once at Jupiter, a gravitational assist maneuver permits solar escape velocity to be reached. Extraterrestrial elevators. A space elevator could also be constructed on other planets, asteroids and moons. A Martian tether could be much shorter than one on Earth. Mars' surface gravity is 38% of Earth's, while it rotates around its axis in about the same time as Earth. Because of this, Martian stationary orbit is much closer to the surface, and hence the elevator would be much shorter. Current materials are already sufficiently strong to construct such an elevator. Building a Martian elevator would be complicated by the Martian moon Phobos, which is in a low orbit and intersects the Equator regularly (twice every orbital period of 11 h 6 min). On the near side of the moon, the strength-to-density required of the tether of a lunar space elevator exists in currently available materials. A lunar space elevator would be about long. Since the moon does not rotate fast enough, there is no effective lunar-stationary orbit, but the Lagrangian points could be used. The near side would extend through the Earth-Moon L1 point from an anchor point near the center of the visible part of Earth's moon. On the far side of the moon, a lunar space elevator would need to be very long (more than twice the length of an Earth elevator) but due to the low gravity of the Moon, can also be made of existing engineering materials. Rapidly spinning asteroids or moons could use cables to eject materials to convenient points, such as Earth orbits; or conversely, to eject materials to send the bulk of the mass of the asteroid or moon to Earth orbit or a Lagrangian point. Freeman Dyson, a physicist and mathematician, has suggested using such smaller systems as power generators at points distant from the Sun where solar power is uneconomical. A space elevator using presently available engineering materials could be constructed between mutually tidally locked worlds, such as Pluto and Charon or the components of binary asteroid Antiope, with no terminus disconnect, according to Francis Graham of Kent State University. However, spooled variable lengths of cable must be used due to ellipticity of the orbits. Construction. The construction of a space elevator would need reduction of some technical risk. Some advances in engineering, manufacturing and physical technology are required. Once a first space elevator is built, the second one and all others would have the use of the previous ones to assist in construction, making their costs considerably lower. Such follow-on space elevators would also benefit from the great reduction in technical risk achieved by the construction of the first space elevator. Construction is conceived as the deployment of a long cable from a large spool. The spool is initially parked in a geostationary orbit above the planned anchor point. When a long cable is dropped ""down"" (toward Earth), it must be balanced by balancing mass being dropped ""up"" (away from Earth) for the whole system to remain on the geosynchronous orbit. Earlier designs imagined the balancing mass to be another cable (with counterweight) extending upward, with the main spool remaining at the original geosynchronous orbit level. Most current designs elevate the spool itself as the main cable is paid out, a simpler process. When the lower end of the cable is so long as to reach the Earth (at the equator), it can be anchored. Once anchored, the center of mass is elevated more (by adding mass at the upper end or by paying out more cable). This adds more tension to the whole cable, which can then be used as an elevator cable. One proposal suggests using conventional rockets to place a ""minimum size"" initial 19,800 kg seed cable, adequate to support the first 619 kg climber. The first 207 climbers carry up more cable, widening the initial ribbon to about 160 mm wide at its widest point. The result is a 750,000 kg cable with a lift capacity of 20 tons per climber. Another proposal results in a system weighing about 1500 tons (including counterweight), with the ribbon about 1 meter wide at its widest point, and can carry up to one 15 ton payload per day. Another proposal results in a system with a lift capacity of 1 ton, at a constant cable stress of 50 GPa, and calculates a taper ratio of 4.28, a 97,700 kg cable, and a 52,700 kg counterweight at the far end. Another proposal estimates that a ""20-ton"" elevator—an elevator that could support a single 20 ton climber—would require a tether mass of 4000 to 6000 tons. Safety issues and construction challenges. For early systems, transit times from the surface to the level of geosynchronous orbit would be about five days. On these early systems, the time spent moving through the Van Allen radiation belts would be enough that passengers would need to be protected from radiation by shielding, which adds mass to the climber and decreases payload. A space elevator would present a navigational hazard, both to aircraft and spacecraft. Aircraft could be diverted by air-traffic control restrictions. All objects in stable orbits that have perigee below the maximum altitude of the cable that are not synchronous with the cable will impact the cable eventually, unless avoiding action is taken. One potential solution proposed by Edwards is to use a movable anchor (a sea anchor) to allow the tether to ""dodge"" any space debris large enough to track. Impacts by space objects such as meteoroids, micrometeorites and orbiting man-made debris, pose another design constraint on the cable. A cable would need to be designed to maneuver out of the way of debris, or absorb impacts of small debris without breaking. Economics. With a space elevator, materials might be sent into orbit at a fraction of the current cost. As of 2000, conventional rocket designs cost about US$25,000 per kilogram (US$11,000 per pound) for transfer to geostationary orbit. Current proposals envision payload prices starting as low as $220 per kilogram ($100 per pound), similar to the $5–$300/kg estimates of the Launch loop, but higher than the $310/ton to 500 km orbit quoted to Dr. Jerry Pournelle for an orbital airship system. Philip Ragan, co-author of the book ""Leaving the Planet by Space Elevator"", states that ""The first country to deploy a space elevator will have a 95 percent cost advantage and could potentially control all space activities.""

wikipedia-184735," Staff of office  A staff of office is a staff, the carrying of which often denotes an official's position, a social rank or a degree of social prestige. Apart from the ecclesiastical and ceremonial usages mentioned below, there are less formal usages. A gold- or silver-topped cane can express social standing (or dandyism). Teachers or prefects in schools traditionally carried less elaborate canes which marked their right (and potential threat) to administer canings, and military officers carry a residual threat of physical punishment in their swagger sticks. Orchestral conductors have in their batons symbols of authority as well as tools of their trade. Ecclesiastical use. Church sidesmen or dodsmen bear sticks or rods or wands of office; bishops may use a crozier or crook. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and some of the Oriental Orthodox Churches an ecclesiastical walking stick is used by bishops, archimandrites and hegumens (abbots) when walking outside. It is usually made of dark wood and is straight, rather than having a curved handle. The walking stick used by bishops and archimandrites is normally adorned with a silver grip at the top and a metal ferrule at the tip. The walking stick used by a hegumen or hegumenia (abbess) is normally of plain wood, unadorned. The walking stick is not used in any liturgical context, except to the extent that when a bishop is formally received at the beginning of the service, he will carry it as he walks into the church. An altar server will usually take it from him when he enters the narthex and return it to him when he leaves at the end of the service. Ceremonial use. Monarchs often have a sceptre signifying their office. There are also offices which take their titles from their staff, such as Black Rod and the Tipstaff. Some corporate bodies use maces. "

wikipedia-4839066," Matt Jarvis  Matthew Thomas Jarvis (born 22 May 1986) is an English international footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club West Ham United. After an unsuccessful spell as a youth team player for Millwall, Jarvis began his professional career with Gillingham, making his Football League debut for the Kent-based team at the age of 17. He made more than 100 appearances for Gillingham and became a target for a number of larger clubs, eventually signing for Wolverhampton Wanderers in June 2007. He became a first team regular for the club, helping them win promotion to the top flight in 2009. In August 2012 he joined West Ham United. He received his first call-up to the England squad in 2011 and made his debut as a substitute against Ghana in a Wembley friendly. Early life. Jarvis' parents, Nick and Linda, both played table tennis professionally and each reached number one in the sport's British rankings. Later they set up the table tennis supplies company Jarvis Sports, which relocated from Guisborough to Guildford in the same year that Jarvis was born. During his years at school in Surrey, Jarvis excelled at several sports, becoming a county champion in both swimming and athletics. He also gained ten GCSE qualifications. Club career. Gillingham. Like his older brother Ben, Jarvis started his career on the books of Millwall, but was released by the club. With the help of a member of the Millwall coaching staff, however, he was taken on by Kent-based club Gillingham as a trainee. On 4 November 2003, at the age of 17, he made his Football League debut in a match against Sunderland when a number of senior players were missing due to influenza. He came on as a 76th minute substitute for Richard Rose in a match which his team lost 3–1. He next played for the first team in an FA Cup defeat to Burnley on 24 January 2004, and went on to feature regularly in the team in March and April. In total he made two starts and eight substitute appearances during the 2003–04 season, but also continued to play for the youth team, helping them reach the last sixteen of the FA Youth Cup. Shortly before the end of the season he signed his first professional contract with the club when manager Andy Hessenthaler gave him a three-year deal. In the 2004–05 season Jarvis became a regular in the Gillingham first team, playing in 30 Football League matches, although he was out of action for five weeks in January and February after undergoing an operation on a hernia. He also scored his first goal for the club in a win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 30 October 2004. Gillingham, however, were relegated from the Football League Championship at the end of the season. In the 2005–06 season he was again a regular, and scored seven goals, his best season tally to date. Midway through the 2006–07 season Gillingham offered Jarvis a new contract, which the club described as the most lucrative it had ever offered to a player of his age. Jarvis rejected the contract offer, but later claimed via his agent that he would be happy to remain at Priestfield Stadium if the club ""demonstrated that it could match his ambitions"". A number of Premier League and Championship clubs showed interest in signing Jarvis, and Plymouth Argyle made an unsuccessful bid for the player, manager Ian Holloway commenting that ""we did make a bid but it got knocked back"". Towards the end of the season Nottingham Forest of Football League One made an offer of £650,000, hoping to circumvent the transfer window by taking the player on loan until the end of the season, but the bid was turned down by the player's agent. Jarvis ended the season having been named in the PFA's League One Team of the Year, and with Charlton Athletic expressing their interest in him. However, Gillingham chairman Paul Scally stated that he believed the player's agent had already agreed a deal with another club. Scally also claimed that Jarvis had the potential to play for England by the time he was 24. Wolverhampton Wanderers. Jarvis rejected a further improved contract offer by Gillingham, to join Wolverhampton Wanderers of the Championship in June 2007, signing a two-year contract with the option to extend his stay by a further year. The clubs agreed a transfer fee but the exact amount was not disclosed. Jarvis suffered hip and groin injuries during pre-season training and was unable to take any further part in training until September. He finally made his debut for his new club on 20 October 2007, when he came on as an 88th minute substitute in a 2–0 home victory over Charlton Athletic. After regaining full fitness, he became a first-choice player at Molineux, making a further 27 appearances during the 2007–08 season. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw with Leicester City in December 2007, in a season where the club missed out on a play-off place by virtue of goal difference. After a strong start to the following season for both club and player, Jarvis injured his hamstring in the defeat to Reading on 30 September 2008 and was expected to be out of action for approximately six weeks. He made his return in the 1–0 defeat to Queens Park Rangers on 6 December, and remained a first choice player as the club won promotion to the Premier League as champions. He made his Premier League debut against West Ham United in August 2009 and played regularly during the 2009–10 season, scoring three times to help them achieve top flight survival. In September 2010 he signed a new contract which would have kept him at the club until the summer of 2015, and was once again a regular in the Wolves team during the 2010–11 season, scoring four Premier League goals, his highest tally for four seasons. On 19 May 2011 Jarvis was awarded both Supporters' Player of the Season award and Players' Player of the season awards. Jarvis submitted a transfer request on 11 August 2012, after media reports linked West Ham United with the player. Wolves rejected several bids for the player, without naming the club involved. On 23 August, Wolves accepted an offer from West Ham of a reported, initial £7.5 million, rising to £10.75 million. West Ham United. On 24 August 2012, Jarvis signed a five-year contract, with the option for an additional year, for a transfer fee which was a club record but was officially undisclosed. Jarvis made his debut for West Ham on 25 August in a 3–0 away defeat to Swansea City. He scored his first goal for the club on 1 October, opening the scoring in a 2-1 win away to Queens Park Rangers. In his first season, he attempted the most open-play crosses in the Premier League, 171, and was successful with 42 of them, also the highest in the Premier League. International career. Jarvis was called up to the England national squad in March 2011 for matches against Wales (a Euro 2012 qualifier) and Ghana (an international friendly). After not being selected for the matchday squad against Wales, he made his debut as a substitute against Ghana at Wembley on 29 March, coming on for Jack Wilshere in the 70th minute of a 1-1 draw. In doing so, he became the first Wolverhampton Wanderers player to play for England since Steve Bull in 1990. Career statistics. International. ""Statistics accurate as of match played 29 March 2011"" Personal life. Jarvis has been married to his wife Sarah since June 2011. In January 2013, he was interviewed for, and appeared on the cover of, gay lifestyle magazine ""Attitude"" to discuss homosexuality in football. "
wikipedia-872580," Moana Carcasses Kalosil  Moana Carcasses Kalosil (born 28 January 1963) is a politician in Vanuatu. He has been Prime Minister of Vanuatu since 23 March 2013. He is the first naturalized citizen of Vanuatu to become the country's prime minister. Biography. Moana Carcasses was born on 27 January 1963 in Taravao, Tahiti, French Polynesia. His mother was ethnically Tahitian. His French father was originally from the region surrounding Carcassonne in Southern France. Political career. He served as Foreign Minister under Prime Minister Edward Natapei from 2003 to 2004. Following parliamentary elections, he became Finance Minister on 28 July 2004 under Prime Minister Serge Vohor. He kept the post of finance minister when Ham Lini became prime minister later in 2004. He remained in that position until 14 November 2005 when he was sacked by Lini for unclear reasons. He is a member of the Vanuatu Green Party (Green Confederation), which he led into the opposition when he lost his cabinet post in November 2005. On that occasion became deputy leader of the opposition. In the September 2008 general election, he retained his seat, as well as the leadership of the Green Confederation, and became whip of the parliamentary Opposition to Prime Minister Edward Natapei's government. In December 2008, he and fellow Member of Parliament Ralph Regenvanu were arrested, detained by the police for 24 hours, and charged with ""harbouring and aiding of prisoners"", ""obstructing police on duty"" and ""accessory after the fact"" to the breakout of 30 inmates from the country's main prison in Port Vila. Although Regenvanu admitted having known of the plans for the breakout, and having assisted escapees in finding shelter at the National Council of Chiefs's nakamal, it is not clear what role Carcasses allegedly played in these events. They were released, provisionally, and appeared in court in February 2009. In January 2009, Prime Minister Edward Natapei's government stated that it would consider seeking Regenvanu's and Carcasses' suspension from Parliament over the charges. In September 2009, the Supreme Court dropped all charges against both men. In December 2009, in the context of a Cabinet reshuffle, Carcasses left the Opposition and joined Natapei's government, becoming Minister of Internal Affairs. In his latter capacity, he argued that unemployment in Vanuatu should be addressed by encouraging young people to return to agricultural work in their native rural areas, and produce their own food, rather than move to Port Vila where they would often struggle to find a job. He joined the Cabinet as the leader of an informal ""Alliance"" of MPs from a variety of small parties, and three independent MPs. As Minister for Internal Affairs and Labour, he stated that he had prevented unqualified applicant Chinese labourers in the construction sector from obtaining or renewing work permits, ""because these people wanted to rob employment from ni-Vanuatu. My policy is that 'man ples' ni-Vanuatu are the priority"". In December 2010, when the Natapei government was ousted in a vote of no confidence, Carcasses supported his successor Sato Kilman, and obtained a post as Minister of Finance and Economic Management in the new government. Kilman was himself ousted in a vote of no confidence on 24 April 2011, however, and Carcasses lost his position in government. He recovered it three weeks later, on 13 May, when the court of appeal voided the election of Serge Vohor's new government on constitutional grounds, and the Kilman government was restored. This lasted for only a month; on 16 June, the Kilman premiership was itself voided on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court's Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, and Carcasses lost office once more. He regained it on 26 June when Kilman was restored as Prime Minister by Parliament, and reinstated his Cabinet. Prime Minister of Vanuatu. Carcasses retained his seat in the October 2012 general election, and maintained his confidence in the Kilman government, of which however he was no longer a member. He sat as a government backbencher until 20 March 2013, when he was one of 8 MPs to cross the floor, join the Opposition and force Kilman to resign. Three days later, Parliament elected Carcasses as Prime Minister, with the support of 34 MPs out of 52. He is the first foreign-born person to lead the country, and his predecessor objected to his election on those grounds. In addition to his focus on the environment (including the creation of a Ministry for Planning and Climate Change), the press noted ""his unwavering support for the West Papua cause"", and his opposition to Indonesia's participation as an observer in the Melanesian Spearhead Group - a position which contrasted with his predecessor's. He entrusted his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Edward Natapei, with a clean-up of the selling of diplomatic passports by previous governments. Within the first few days of the Carcasses government, the passports of ""about ten"" diplomats were revoked, with indications that more than two thirds of the country's diplomats could lose their position, as their appointment had not followed proper procedures.

wikipedia-827635," Learning Vector Quantization  In computer science, Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), is a prototype-based supervised classification algorithm. LVQ is the supervised counterpart of vector quantization systems. Overview. LVQ can be understood as a special case of an artificial neural network, more precisely, it applies a winner-take-all Hebbian learning-based approach. It is a precursor to Self-organizing maps (SOM) and related to Neural gas, and to the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (k-NN). LVQ was invented by Teuvo Kohonen. An LVQ system is represented by prototypes W=(w(i)...,w(n)) which are defined in the feature space of observed data. In  winner-take-all training algorithms one determines, for each data point, the prototype which is closest to the input according to a given distance measure. The position of this so-called winner prototype is then adapted, i.e. the winner is moved closer if it correctly classifies the data point or moved away if it classifies the data point incorrectly.  An advantage of LVQ is that it creates prototypes that are easy to interpret for experts in the respective application domain.  LVQ systems can be applied to multi-class classification problems in a natural way.  It is used in a variety of practical applications, see http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/Neural/SOM.LVQ.html for an extensive bibliography.  A key issue in LVQ is the choice of an appropriate measure of distance or similarity for training and classification. Recently, techniques have been developed which adapt a parameterized distance measure in the course of training the system, see e.g. (Schneider, Biehl, and Hammer, 2009) and references therein.  LVQ can be a source of great help in classifying text documents.  "
wikipedia-8773661," Dobos torte  Dobos torte or Dobosh (, ) is a Hungarian cake named after its inventor, a well-known Hungarian confectioner, József C. Dobos (1847–1924) in 1884. It is a five-layer sponge cake, layered with chocolate buttercream and topped with thin caramel slices. The sides of the cake are sometimes coated with ground hazelnuts, chestnuts, walnuts or almonds but the original cake is uncoated, since it was a slice of a big cake. Dobos' aim was to make a cake that would last longer than other pastries, in an age when cooling techniques were limited. The caramel topping helps keep the cake from drying out. The name is also sometimes spelled 'Dobos-torta' or 'Dobostorta'; since ""dobos"" means ""drummer"", it's sometimes joked about that the name comes from the frosting the cake has, which is so hard it can be beaten like a drum. History. Dobosh or Dobos Torte (type of cake) was first introduced at the ""National General Exhibition of Budapest"" in 1885; Franz Joseph I and his Empress Elisabeth were among the first to taste it. The cake soon became popular throughout Europe as it was different from all others. It was simple but elegant, as opposed to the multi-layer, flaming cakes of the age. Its other secret was its use of fine buttercream, which was very little known at the time; cake fillings and frostings were usually made with cooked pastry cream or whipped cream. The chocolate buttercream and the batter of the cake were both invented by Jozsef C. Dobos. Dobos travelled around Europe and introduced the cake wherever he went. For a long time he kept the recipe confidential, until 1906 when he retired and gave the original recipe to the ""Budapest Confectioners' and Gingerbread Makers' Chamber of Industry"", providing that every member of the chamber can use it freely. Dobos Torte is known everywhere in the world and there are more than one hundred recipe variations. It is a commonly made torte in the upscale hotels, restaurants and pastry shops of the world. Another famous Hungarian dessert created in the same era is Rigo Jancsi. "
wikipedia-1690979," Macanese cuisine  Macanese cuisine is unique to Macau, China, and consists of a blend of southern Chinese and Portuguese cuisines, with significant influences from Southeast Asia and the Lusophone world. Many unique dishes resulted from the spice blends that the wives of Portuguese sailors used in an attempt to replicate European dishes. Its ingredients and seasonings include those from Europe, Latin America, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as local Chinese ingredients. Common cooking techniques include baking, grilling and roasting. The former, seldom seen in other styles of Chinese cooking, speaks to the eclectic nature of Macanese cooking. Macau is renowned for its flavour-blending culture, and modern Macanese cuisine may be considered a type of fusion cuisine. Typically, Macanese food is seasoned with various spices including turmeric, coconut milk, cinnamon and ""bacalhau"", giving special aromas and tastes. Famous dishes include ""Galinha à Portuguesa"", ""Galinha à Africana"" (African chicken), ""Bacalhau"", ""Pato de cabidela"", Macanese chili shrimps, ""Minchi"", and stir-fried curry crab. Other dishes include pig's ear and papaya salad, and rabbit stewed in wine, cinnamon and star anise. ""Tapas"" are also an integral part of Macanese cuisine. The most popular snack is the pork chop bun. The most popular desserts are ginger milk, ""pastéis de nata"" (egg tarts), and almond cake. The famous restaurants of Macau include the ""Restaurante Porto Interior"", ""Restaurante Litoral"", ""Restaurante Espao"" and ""Restaurante O Santos"" "
wikipedia-1264173," Max Wall  Max Wall (12 March 1908 – 21 May 1990), was an English comedian and actor, whose performing career covered music hall, theatre, films and television. Early years. Wall was born Maxwell George Lorimer, son of the successful music-hall entertainer Jack (Jock) Lorimer, a Scottish comedy actor from Forfar, known for his songs and dancing, and his wife Stella (born Maud Clara Mitchison). He was born near the Oval, at 37 Glenshaw Mansions, Brixton Road, London SW9. In 1916, during a World War I air raid, Max and his elder brother Alex were saved from death by a cast iron bed frame, but his younger brother Bunty and their Aunt Betty, who was looking after them, were killed by a bomb dropped from a German Zeppelin which also destroyed their house. Max and Alex went to live with their father and his family, whilst their mother went to live with Harry Wallace, whom she had met on tour. When their father died of tuberculosis in 1920, aged 37, their mother married Harry Wallace, and they all moved to a pub in Essex. Career. Early career. Wall auditioned for a part with a touring theatre company, and made his stage debut at the age of 14 as Jack in ""Mother Goose"" with a travelling pantomime company in Devon and Cornwall featuring George Lacey. In 1925 he was a speciality dancer in the London Revue at the Lyceum. He became determined not to rely on his father's name, so abbreviated Maxwell to Max, and his stepfather's name Wallace, to Wall. He is best remembered for his ludicrously attired and hilariously strutting ""Professor Wallofski"". John Cleese has acknowledged Wall's influence on his own ""Ministry of Silly Walks"" sketch for ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"". After appearing in many musicals and stage comedies in the 1930s, Wall's career went into decline, and he was reduced to working in obscure nightclubs. He then joined the Royal Air Force during World War II and served for three years until he was invalided out in 1943. Re-emergence. Wall re-emerged during the 1950s when producers and directors rediscovered his comic talents, along with the expressive power of his tragic clown face and the distinctive sad falling cadences of his voice. He secured television appearances and, having attracted Samuel Beckett's attention, he won parts in ""Waiting for Godot"" in 1979 and ""Krapp's Last Tape"" in 1984. In 1966 he appeared as Père Ubu in Jarry's ""Ubu Roi"", and in 1972 he toured with Mott the Hoople on their ""Rock n' Roll Circus Tour"", gaining a new audience. His straight acting gained him this review in 1974: ""Max Wall makes Olivier look like an amateur in ""The Entertainer"" at Greenwich Theatre..."" (""The Guardian"", 27 November 1974). He also appeared in ""Crossroads (as Walter Soper - 1982 to 1983)"", ""Coronation Street (as Harry Payne - 1978)"" and what was then ""Emmerdale Farm (as Arthur Braithwaite - 1978)"". He also played ex-con Ernie Dodds in ""Minder"" in 1982, with George Cole. Later work. On 1 April 1977, Wall's version of Ian Dury's ""England's Glory"" was issued on Stiff Records (BUY 12) and given away with the album ""Hits Greatest Stiffs"". Wall also appeared onstage with Dury at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1978, but was poorly received, and said ""They only want the walk"". He played one of the inventors in the 1960s film ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" and in 1977 he was seen as King Bruno the Questionable in Terry Gilliam's film ""Jabberwocky"". In the 1970s and '80s, Wall occasionally performed a one-man stage show, ""Aspects of Max Wall"", in which he recaptured the humour of old-time music hall theatre. His last film appearance was in 1989 in the 12-minute film ""A Fear of Silence"", a dark tale of a man who drives a stranger to a confession of murder by answering only ""yes"" or ""no"" to his questions; those two words, repeated, were his only dialogue. The film won a gold award in the ""New York Film and TV Festival"". Death. On the afternoon of 20 May 1990, Wall fell at Simpson's Restaurant in central London, fracturing his skull. He never regained consciousness, and died early the next morning at Westminster Hospital. He was 82. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery. Wall was survived by four sons, Michael, Melvin, Martin and Meredith, and a daughter, Maxine. "

He held an original position in the historical discipline and was not part of any historical 'school', working in such varied fields as conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), the epistemology of history, linguistics, the foundations of an anthropology of history and social history, the history of law and the history of government. He became known for his doctoral thesis ""Critique and Crisis"" (1954), which was strongly influenced by the thought of Carl Schmitt; his habilitation thesis on ""Prussia between Reform and Revolution"", dealing with Prussia and Germany in the 18th and 19th centuries, followed in 1965. Between 1972 and 1997 Koselleck co-edited, together with Werner Conze and Otto Brunner, the eight-volume encyclopedia ""Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe"" (Basic Concepts in History: A Historical Dictionary of Political and Social Language in Germany."") This work, together with his later contributions, became the corner-stone of conceptual history, the study of the changing semantics and pragmatics of concepts in their social and political contexts. Among his main contributions to Historiography are his reflections on time and temporality in history and the history of language, most famously the leading hypothesis of the ""Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe"" about a ""saddle time"", or ""threshold time"" between 1750 to 1850, during which language (in Germany) changed into the language of modernity. Critique and Crisis. In this 1959 book, Koselleck argues that contemporary understandings of politics have become dangerously depoliticized by Enlightenment utopianism, a reaction against Absolutism (the Hobbesian state), itself a reaction against the religious wars of the Middle Ages in Europe. Though the absolute state had subjugated morality to private realms, in order to avoid civil war, those private realms grew in power, eventually challenging the state, but in an apolitical, utopian way. ""In the process,"" writes Victor Gourevitch in his foreward to Critique and Crisis, ""existing political societies came to be judged by standards which take little or no account of the constraints which political men must inevitably take into account, standards which for all political intents and purposes are therefore Utopian."" The problem is that because utopianism is no political alternative, this Enlightenment anti-statism creates a crisis with which modern nation-states are still coping Kosellek argues that politics is better understood from the point of view of public servants, politicians, and statesman, than supposedly disinterested observers. Koselleck wishes to re-politicize contemporary discussions of politics and infuse them with a sense that conflict is an inevitable part of public life, an argument reminiscent of Isaiah Berlin, Koselleck's contemporary.

wikipedia-1001139," Yano  Yano is a folk/punk rock band in the Philippines formed in 1993. The band members were originally composed of vocalist Dong Abay and Eric Gancio on guitar. Onie Badiang later joined them as bassist; Nowie Favila was the usual drummer but declined to join the group due to commitments with Ang Grupong Pendong. Other drummers of the band included Nonong Timbalopez, Harley Alarcon and Jun Nogoy. The band got their name when Abay looked through an entry in """"Talahulugang Pilipino"""", an old Tagalog dictionary. ""Yano"" in Tagalog means ""simple"", a term often used by Tagalog speakers in Quezon. The group disbanded in 1997 after Dong Abay left the band. As of 2007, Gancio revived Yano as a one-man band, although he will continue to use sidemen as backing musicians for live performances. In 2008, he will be releasing a new album, which he described as the fourth Yano album rather than his second album. History. In 1992, Dong Abay, Eric Gancio and Larry Mapolon met in ""Patatag"", a progressive vocal ensemble. After a year, they decided to form a band called NG (pronounced as ""en-ji"" and derived from the Ng diagraph, which is included on the Filipino alphabet) with percussionist Renmin Nadela. Abay and Gancio remained and recruited musical arranger and bassist, Onie Badiang to the group. Eventually, the band's name was renamed to Yano. They recorded their demo at the home studio of alternative artist Joey Ayala in June 1993. One of the tracks, """"Kumusta Na?"","" (""How Are You?"") a song about the ""EDSA Revolution"", found its way to a local radio station where the group was first heard. This paved the way for Yano to become active in the local club circuit. Mayrics, Club Dredd, 70s Bistro were among the first clubs that Yano performed in. Drummers for the band included Nowie Favila (Ang Grupong Pendong), Nonong Timbalopez (Put3Ska, Ex President's Combo), Jun Nogoy (Coffeebreak Island) and Harley Alarcon (Rizal Underground and POT). In 1994, the band's self-titled debut album came out and spawned classic Filipino rock songs such as """"Banal Na Aso, Santong Kabayo"""" (""Holy Dog, Saintly Horse""), """"Tsinelas"""" (""Slippers"") and ""Esem"" (wordplay for SM or Shoemart mall). This was followed by a string of successful concerts around the Philippine archipelago. Their first album from Alpha records (re-issued by BMG) reached quadruple platinum in 1994. After producing three studio albums, Abay quit during the late 1990s because of fame-induced pressure. The group later disbanded after Abay’s absence. After quitting the band, Abay struggled with clinical depression and stayed only in his bedroom for about five years. He came out of depression while writing new songs set into poetry. He later called Badiang to borrow a guitar and jam. Eventually they formed another band, Pan with bassist Milo Duane Cruz and drummer Melvin Leyson. Abay got the term ""Pan"" after reading Tom Robbins' novel ""Jitterbug Perfume"". They released their debut album entitled ""Parnaso ng Payaso"" in 2003. Pan was later disbanded because Abay went back to school in U.P. Diliman. He released """"Sampol"""", an EP in 2005, which was later reborn into ""Flipino"" and released in May 2006. He is currently pursuing a career as an independent artist. Gancio returned to his homeland in Davao after the demise of Yano. In 2004, he released an EP for his solo album ""Sa Bandang Huli"". Gancio did all the instruments in his indie-released album and mixed the music in a PC-based software. Gancio is reviving Yano as a multi-instrumentalist and is currently performing as Yano in Davao with Bassist Dave Ibao and Drummer Jan Najera. He will be releasing an album, which, according to Gancio, will be the ""fourth Yano album."" Badiang played bass for Filipino folk/rock band Asin. He currently reconnected to Joey Ayala's Bagong Lumad while Favila is currently playing gigs outside the Phiippines. Milo Cruz, one of the supporting musician, is now living in New Zealand since mid-2003 and is now a sound engineer. He still plays regularly with various Kiwi bands and founded an all-Filipino band FLIP doing both covers and originals. He also started his own production company named ATBP Productions. ATBP is an abbreviation of a Filipino expression """"at iba pa"""", a counterpart for the Latin """"et cetera"""". Music. Yano’s music was well known for their political and social themes. Their songs censure religious hypocrites like in ""Banal Na Aso, Santong Kabayo"" (Tagalog for ""Holy Dog, Saintly Horse""), corrupt politicians in ""Trapo"" (colloquial, pejorative term for traditional politicians, also literally translates to ""dust rag""), the lingo of the Philippine's elite in ""Coño Ka P’re"" (""You're a ""coño"""") and abusive capitalists in ""Mc’Jo"" (alluding to the fastfood chain McDonald's where Abay once worked as a crew member). Yano’s songs also narrate the situation of Philippine society during the 1990s. ""Kumusta Na?"" (""How are you?"") discusses the condition of the Filipino masses after the 1986 EDSA Revolution while the novelty-styled song ""Kaka"" tells a story of a person named Kaka, who is having difficulty in finding things in the dark after a power outage, a reference to the frequent blackouts in the Philippines during the early 1990s. The song ""Bawal"" (""prohibited"") speaks about the effects of rules or laws with excessive restrictions to the point where it leads to suppression of freedom and love. ""Abno"", also known as ""Abnormal Environmental"", tackles the environment while ""Kaklase"" (""classmate"") focuses on students facing maltreatment by their teachers. Another social relevant song, ""Mercy"", tells about the story of a crazy peddler in the Philippines known as a ""taong grasa"" (""greasy person""). Abay's experiences as a student at the University of the Philippines, enabled him to write songs in dismay of their school like in ""State U"" and their life in the university, such as ""Esem"" (in reference to the SM City North EDSA mall, which is about a mile away from the UP Diliman campus) and ""Iskolar Ng Bayan"" (""The Nation's Scholar""). They also made some love songs in their music like ""Senti"" (short for ""sentimental"") and ""Paalam Sampaguita"" (""Goodbye Sampaguita""). The latter also tackles the migration of many Filipinos to other countries to seek better opportunities. "

wikipedia-1697135," Daube  Daube is a classic Provençal (or more broadly, French) stew made with inexpensive beef braised in wine, vegetables, garlic, and ""herbes de Provence"", and traditionally cooked in a daubière, a braising pan. The meat used in daube is cut from the shoulder and back of the bull, though some suggest they should be made from three cuts of meat: the ""gelatinous shin for body, short ribs for flavor, and chuck for firmness."" Although most modern recipes call for red wine, a minority call for white, as do the earliest recorded daube recipes. Daube is adapted in New Orleans cuisine to make daube glacé. Variations also call for olives, prunes, and flavoring with duck fat, vinegar, brandy, lavender, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, juniper berries, or orange peel. For best flavor, it is cooked in several stages, and cooled for a day after each stage to allow the flavors to meld together. In the Camargue and Béarn area of France, bulls killed in bullfighting festivals are often used for daube. Traditionally it should be cooked for a long time and prepared the night before it is served.  Daube with lamb is traditionally made with white wine. "
wikipedia-669733," Die casting  Die casting is a metal casting process that is characterized by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mould cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin based alloys. Depending on the type of metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.  The casting equipment and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small to medium sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency. Two variants are pore-free die casting, which is used to eliminate gas porosity defects; and direct injection die casting, which is used with zinc castings to reduce scrap and increase yield. History. Die casting equipment was invented in 1838 for the purpose of producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885, Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the ""acurad"" process. Cast metals. The main die casting alloys are: zinc, aluminium, magnesium, copper, lead, and tin; although uncommon, ferrous die casting is also possible. Specific die casting alloys include: ZAMAK; zinc aluminium; aluminium to, e.g. The Aluminum Association (AA) standards: AA 380, AA 384, AA 386, AA 390; and AZ91D magnesium. The following is a summary of the advantages of each alloy: Maximum weight limits for aluminium, brass, magnesium, and zinc castings are approximately , , , and , respectively. The material used defines the minimum section thickness and minimum draft required for a casting as outlined in the table below. The thickest section should be less than , but can be greater. Equipment. There are two basic types of die casting machines: ""hot-chamber machines"" and ""cold-chamber machines"". These are rated by how much clamping force they can apply. Typical ratings are between . Hot-chamber machines. Hot-chamber machines, also known as ""gooseneck machines"", rely upon a pool of molten metal to feed the die. At the beginning of the cycle the piston of the machine is retracted, which allows the molten metal to fill the ""gooseneck"". The pneumatic or hydraulic powered piston then forces this metal out of the gooseneck into the die. The advantages of this system include fast cycle times (approximately 15 cycles a minute) and the convenience of melting the metal in the casting machine. The disadvantages of this system are that high-melting point metals cannot be utilized and aluminium cannot be used because it picks up some of the iron while in the molten pool. Due to this, hot-chamber machines are primarily used with zinc, tin, and lead based alloys. Cold-chamber machines. These are used when the casting alloy cannot be used in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large composition of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. This biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due to the need to transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine. Dies. Two dies are used in die casting; one is called the ""cover die half"" and the other the ""ejector die half"". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die contains the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die is attached to the movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two ""cavity inserts"", which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves. The dies are designed so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die and stay in the ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ""ejector pins"" to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ""ejector pin plate"", which accurately drives all of the pins at the same time and with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the castings purpose. Other die components include ""cores"" and ""slides"". Cores are components that usually produce holes or opening, but they can be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called ""pick-outs"", are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes. These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part at the end of the cycle. The core then must be removed by hand. Loose cores are the most expensive type of core, because of the extra labor and increased cycle time. Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines. These vents are usually wide and thin (approximately ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap. No risers are used because the high pressure ensures a continuous feed of metal from the gate. The most important material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly dependent on the temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels. The main failure mode for die casting dies is wear or erosion. Other failure modes are ""heat checking"" and ""thermal fatigue"". Heat checking is when surface cracks occur on the die due to a large temperature change on every cycle. Thermal fatigue is when surface cracks occur on the die due to a large number of cycles. Process. The following are the four steps in ""traditional die casting"", also known as """", these are also the basis for any of the die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between . Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%. The high-pressure injection leads to a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before any part of the casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity in the center of the casting. Most die casters perform other secondary operations to produce features not readily castable, such as tapping a hole, polishing, plating, buffing, or painting. Inspection. After the shakeout of the casting it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects can be caused by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. ""Flow marks"" are marks left on the surface of the casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant. Lubricants. Water-based lubricants, called ""emulsions"", are the most commonly used type of lubricant, because of health, environmental, and safety reasons. Unlike solvent-based lubricants, if water is properly treated to remove all minerals from it, it will not leave any by-product in the dies. If the water is not properly treated, then the minerals can cause surface defects and discontinuities. There are four types of water-based lubricants: oil in water, water in oil, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Oil in water is the best, because when the lubricant is applied the water cools the die surface by evaporating while depositing the oil, which helps release the shot. A common mixture for this type of lubricants is thirty parts water to one part oil, however in extreme cases a ratio of 100:1 is used. Oils that are used include heavy residual oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides. Historically, solvent-based lubricants, such as diesel fuel and kerosene, were commonly used. These were good at releasing the part from the dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, which led to a build-up of carbon on the mold cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants. Advantages and disadvantages. Advantages: The main disadvantage to die casting is the very high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore to make die casting an economic process a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages include: the process is limited to high-fluidity metals and casting weights must be between 30 grams (1 oz) and 10 kg (20 lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have a small amount of porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Variants. Acurad was a die casting process developed by General Motors in the late 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting. The thermal analysis was the first done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper. The Acurad system employed a bottom fill system that required a stable flow-front. Logical thought processes and trial and error were used because computerized analysis did not exist yet; however this modeling was the precursor to computerized flow and fill modeling. The Acurad system was the first die casting process that could successfully cast low-iron aluminum alloys, such as A356 and A357. In a traditional die casting process these alloys would solder to the die. Similarly, Acurad castings could be heat treated and meet the U.S. military specification MIL-A-21180. Finally, the Acurad system employed a patented double shot piston design. The idea was to use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified around the perimeter of the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting. Pore-free. When no porosity is allowed in a cast part then the pore-free casting process is used. It is identical to the standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys. Heated-manifold direct-injection. Heated-manifold direct-injection die casting, also known as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles. Semi-solid. ""Semi-solid die casting"" uses metal that is heated between its liquidus and solidus, so that it is ""slushy"". This allows for more complex parts and thinner walls. "

The creation of the team was formally announced at the opening of the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on 16 June 2009, in time to coincide with the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. The Kings' catchment area is made up of the Eastern Cape and parts of the Western Cape. They draw players from 3 provincial unions, namely the , based in Port Elizabeth (representing the southern half of the Eastern Cape), the , based in East London (representing the northern half of the Eastern Cape) and the , based in George (representing the South Western Districts). History. Southern Spears. In 2005, there was an attempt to bring a Super Rugby side to the Eastern Cape Province in the form of the Southern Spears, who were intended to participate in the Super 14 from 2007 onwards; however, their proposed entry into the competition led to considerable controversy within the country's rugby establishment. In April 2006, after concerns over the team's financial stability and sporting competitiveness, the Spears were denied entry into the Super 14. Following this, the Southern Spears ceased to exist. Formation. In January 2009, SARU announced that a new franchise in the Eastern Cape Province would be launched in June of that year to coincide with the arrival of the British and Irish Lions in Port Elizabeth for one of their midweek tour matches. The franchise was launched with the goal of a future place in Super Rugby, but no timetable was initially set. The President of the Eastern Province, Cheeky Watson, said ""There is a desperate hunger for top-flight rugby in the South Eastern Cape and this is the first step to satisfying it."" The franchise was officially announced on the SARU website in April 2009. First fixtures.

wikipedia-14231276," Iphigénie  Iphigénie is a dramatic tragedy in five acts written in alexandrine verse by the French playwright Jean Racine. It was first performed in the Orangerie in Versailles on August 18, 1674 as part of the fifth of the royal ""Divertissements de Versailles"" of Louis XIV to celebrate the conquest of Franche-Comté. Later in December it was triumphantly revived at the Hôtel de Bourgogne, home of the royal troupe of actors in Paris. With Iphigénie, Racine returned once again to a mythological subject, following a series of historical plays (""Britannicus"", ""Bérénice"", ""Bajazet"", ""Mithridate""). On the shores at Aulis, the Greeks prepare their departure for an attack on Troy. The gods quell the winds for their journey and demand the sacrifice of  Iphigénie, daughter of Agamemnon, King of the Greeks. As in the original version of the play by Euripides, Iphigenia in Aulis, the morally strongest character in the play is not Agamemnon, a pusillanimous leader, but Iphigénie, driven by duty to father and country to accept the will of the gods. In the final sacrificial scene of Euripides' play, the goddess Artemis substitutes a deer for Iphigenia, who is swept through the heavens by the gods to Tauris. Based on the writings of Pausanias, Racine decided upon an alternative dramatic solution for the ending: another princess Ériphile is revealed to be the true ""Iphigénie"" whose life is sought by the gods and thus the tragic heroine of the play is spared. Although a great success when it was first produced, Iphigénie is rarely performed today. Synopsis. The play is set in Aulis, in the royal tent of Agamemnon. Act I. At dawn in the Greek camp at Aulis, where the Greek fleets are moored in wait for a campaign against Troy, Agamemnon entrusts his servant Arcas with a message to prevent the visit of his wife Clytemnestre and daughter Iphigénie, summoned by him supposedly for Iphigénie's marriage to Achille but in truth for her sacrifice to the goddess Diana: the oracle has pronounced that only after the sacrifice of Iphigénie will the gods unleash the becalmed winds needed to carry the Greek ships to Troy. Having doubts about his duplicitous scheme, Agamemnon's message now tells of Achille's withdrawal from the planned marriage. Achille, unaware of these events, cannot be dissuaded from his wish to marry Iphigénie and leave for Troy, even though he has been predicted to die there. In Achille's absence, Ulysse convinces Agamemnon that his daughter's sacrifice is necessary to avenge the honour of Helen of Troy and for the eternal glory of Greece. The arrival is announced of Clytemnestre and Iphigénie with Eriphile, a young girl in their charge, captured by Achille on the island of Lesbos, an ally of Troy: the message has not reached them. Act II. Eriphile discloses her troubled state to her confidante Doris: she will never know the secret circumstances of her high birth that would have been revealed in Troy according to Doris' father, killed during the overthrow of Lesbos; and, far from hating the conquering Achille, she has been overcome by an  uncontrollable passion for him, feeling she has either to separate him from Iphigénie or take her own life. Iphigénie confides to Eriphile her unease at her reception: Achille's absence and Agamemnon's cold evasiveness, telling her only that she will be present at the sacrifice currently in preparation. Clytemnestra, outraged after having at last received her husband's message from Arcas, tells Iphigénie that they cannot stay, Achille having reportedly chosen not to marry her because of Eriphile. Distraught with grief at her cruel and vicious betrayal by Eriphile, Iphigénie leaves dejectedly on being discovered by Achille. In turn astonished and confused by her presence in Aulis, Achille expresses his dismay at the efforts of the Greek leaders to prevent his marriage. Smitten by jealousy, Eriphile resolves to profit from this confusion. Act III. Clytemnestre announces to Agamemnon that she and her daughter will no longer leave, since Achille has convinced them of his sincerity and his wish for an immediate marriage to Iphigénie. After his attempts at discouragement fail, Agamemnon forbids her to accompany Iphigénie to the sacrificial altar. Perplexed by his motives, she nevertheless accedes to his wishes. Achille appears to inform Agamemnon of his good news and of the high priest Calchas' predictions of favourable winds. He promises to Iphigénie that he will give Eriphile her liberty as soon as they are married. Arcas arrives to announce that Agamemnon has summoned Iphigénie to the altar, revealing to the horror of all that is she who is to be sacrificed. Clytemenestre entrusts her daughter to Achille and rushes off to petition the king.  Achille vents his rage at being used as a pawn by Agamemnon and vows to be avenged, while Iphigénie nobly rises to the defense of her father. Prevented from entering the king's presence, Clytemnestre implores Achille to help, but Iphigénie prevails upon him to wait until Agamemnon is obliged to fetch her in person and is pierced by the extreme suffering of his wife and daughter. Act IV. The plight of Iphigénie only serves to increase Eriphile's envy of her: Achille's efforts to save her; Agamemnon's continuing hesitation despite the secrecy of the sacrificial victim's name. She decides to reveal everything she has heard in order to sow more trouble and discord, thus averting the threat hanging over Troy. Clytemnestre leaves Iphigénie, who still takes her father's side, and waits for her husband. Agamemnon eventually appears, blaming her for her daughter's delay. When Iphigénie enters in tears, he realizes that they know everything. Iphigénie pleads for her life with restraint, nevertheless piercingly reminding her father that her pleas are made for the sake of others – her mother and her betrothed – rather than herself. In turn Clytemnestre vents her wrath upon Agamemnon, condemning his barbarity and inhumanity in being so easily swayed to spill his innocent daughter's blood. Finally Achille calls him to account, barely containing his fury. In a heated exchange, Agamemnon defies Achille's attempts to question the personal actions of a king and commander, saying that he must share responsibility for Iphigénie's fate as one of the soldiers pushing to leave for Troy and hinting that his services are not indispensable. Achille counters, saying that Iphigénie is more important to him than the Trojan war, that the bond forged with her could not be so easily broken and that he would do all in his power to defend her. Achille's threats only serve to harden Agamemnon's resolve to sacrifice Iphigénie; however, instead of ordering the guards to fetch her, he finally decides to save her, but solely so he can choose another husband for her and thus humiliate Achille. He instructs Clytemnestre that she must secretly leave the camp with Iphigénie and flee from Aulis, under protection of his own guards. Instead of following them, Eriphile vindictively decides to reveal all to the high priest Calchas. Act V. In her despair Iphigénie, prevented from leaving the city and forbidden ever again to speak to Achille, feels that sacrificial death is the only choice left. Achille arrives to offer her the support of his troops. She continues to defend her father and insists on the need for her sacrifice. Achille leaves her, still resolved to defend her. Her mother's entreaties are met with a similar response; she departs to make her own way to the sacrificial altar. Clytemnestre is beside herself with grief and despair, conjuring up the god of thunder at the end of her apocalyptic invocations. Arcas comes to fetch her on behalf of Achille, who with his soldiers has interrupted the sacrifice; but then Ulysse arrives to reassure Clytemnestre that her daughter has been saved as the result of an unexpected miracle. At the moment that Achille and the other Greeks were facing each other for combat, the high priest Calchas revealed that, according to the oracle, Eriphile, the secret daughter of Hélène and Thésée, was also called ""Iphigénie"" and it was she whom the gods had required to be sacrificed. Eriphile then stabbed herself on the altar, her death being immediately followed by a cosmic cataclysm: lightning, thunder, winds, motions of the waves and a pyre of flames in which the goddess Diana herself appeared. Clytemnestre leaves to join her now reconciled family and future son-in-law, thanking the gods for this deliverance. Historical context. During the 17th century, the legend of Iphigenia was popular amongst playwrights. The lost painting of Timanthus from Ancient Greece copied in a first-century fresco in Pompeii was one of the most celebrated representations of the sacrifice of Iphigenia from antiquity, to which Cicero, Quintillian, Valerius Maximus and Pliny the Elder all made reference. The aesthetic impact of the painting was such that it was even cited by the Abbé d'Aubignac in his celebrated ""Theatrical Practice"", published in 1657 and annotated by Racine. He wrote that in order to depict the sacrifice of Iphigenia one should imitate the different degrees of grief amongst those present: the sadness of the Greek princes, the extreme affliction on Menelaus' face, Clytemnestra's tears of despair, and finally Agamemnon, his face masked by a veil to conceal his sensitive nature from his generals, but by this means to show nevertheless the extent of his grief. In the play Arcas relates to Clytemnestra that at the moment of Iphigenia's sacrifice or in very rough translation  There are detailed contemporary reports of the first performance at Versailles. André Felibien, secretary of the Royal Academy of architecture, recorded his impressions in a booklet: Influence. The German classical composer Christoph Willibald Gluck's opera Iphigénie en Aulide, first performed at the Paris Opéra in 1774, was based on Racine's play. "
wikipedia-2643313," Dolasetron  Dolasetron (trade name Anzemet) is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist used to treat nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. Its main effect is to reduce the activity of the vagus nerve, which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata. It does not have much antiemetic effect when symptoms are due to motion sickness. This drug does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors. Dolasetron breaks down slowly, staying in the body for a long time. One dose usually lasts 4 to 9 hours and is usually administered once or twice daily. This drug is removed from the body by the liver and kidneys.  Adverse effects. Dolasetron is a well-tolerated drug with few side effects. Headache, dizziness, and constipation are the most commonly reported side effects associated with its use. There is a potential for prolonging of the QT interval to occur as well. There have been no significant drug interactions reported with this drug's use. It is broken down by the liver's cytochrome P450 system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system. Intravenous dolasetron is contraindicated in Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are as emetogenic as cisplatin, and preventive drugs should always be considered. The 5HT3 agonists are the mainstays of prevention and are frequently used in combination with other drugs such as corticosteroids and the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. However, the FDA recently issued a drug communication stating that the injection form of dolasetron, a 5HT3 agonist, should no longer be used in adult or pediatric patients with CINV. Dolasetron injection can increase the risk of developing torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm. Patients with underlying heart conditions or existing heart rate or rhythm problems are at increased risk. Although the oral form of this agent can still be used, careful monitoring and correction of potassium and magnesium levels should be initiated prior to and during treatment. In addition, in older patients and in patients with heart failure, a slow heart rate, underlying cardiac disease, and those with renal impairment, monitoring with electrocardiography is indicated when this drug is used. Congenital long-QT syndrome and drugs that prolong the PR or QRS interval are contraindications to dolasetron therapy. Dolasetron injection may still be used for the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. As per Food and Drug Administration. "
wikipedia-2589423," Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area  The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA) is a United States National Recreation Area containing many individual parks and open space preserves, located primarily in the Santa Monica Mountains of Southern California. The SMMNRA is located within the greater Los Angeles region, with two thirds of the parklands in northwest Los Angeles County, and the remaining third, including a Simi Hills extension, in southeastern Ventura County. Overall administration is by the National Park Service, coordinating with state, county, municipal, and university agencies. The Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area preserves one of the best examples of a Mediterranean climate ecosystem in the world. It also protects one of the highest densities of archaeological resources in any mountain range in the world. Geography. The Santa Monica Mountains NRA contains in the Santa Monica Mountains of the Transverse Ranges between the Pacific Ocean and inland valleys. Its southeastern slopes are part of the headwaters of the Los Angeles River. The California State Park system owns , the National Park Service controls , and the rest of the SMMNRA lands are in local agencies parks, university study reserves, and private property conservation easements. In size the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the largest urban national park in the United States. Park history. The movement to preserve the Santa Monica Mountains has a long tradition which is frequently overlooked by historians who often focus exclusively on the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s which culminated with the establishment of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in 1978. Griffith Park. The first area in the Santa Monica Mountains set aside for public use was Griffith Park which was donated to the city of Los Angeles by Griffith J. Griffith in 1896. National Forest. During the first decade of the twentieth century, Frederick H. Rindge made several attempts to create a forest reserve in the Santa Monica Mountains. These reserves were precursors to national forests. In 1902 California’s State Mining Bureau examined the area being considered for the establishment of a forest reserve. The resulting report was sent to Washington where the proposal for a reserve was denied.  In 1907 an application was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior requesting that at least 70,000 acres in the mountains be designated a forest reserve. This time state mineralogist Lewis E. Aubury opposed the venture. He wrote the ""L.A. Time"" newspaper stating, “I believe that the lands embraced in the Malibu and Santa Monica districts should not be included in a forest reserve…I shall at once take the matter up with Gifford Pinchot, forester, Washington, D.C., and endeavor to ascertain his views on the subject, and further protest against the creation of this proposed reserve”. Days later the U. S. Forest Service advised Aubury that it was highly improbable that a forest reserve would be created owing to local opposition and the small amount of public land still remaining in the Santa Monica Mountains. Whitestone National Park. Limestone deposits were discovered in the mountains behind Pacific Palisades in 1925 which led to a lengthy battle between wealthy home owners of the area and land developers. The quarry site was in Traylor Canyon, three miles inland from the sea, between Santa Ynez and Temescal Canyons. Alphonzo Bell, Sr. was the real estate developer behind the quarry scheme while local opposition was led by Sylvia Morrison, who championed the preservation of the area’s natural beauty.  After much criticism of his original plan, Bell offered a new proposal. Using a new process, he would have the rock pulverized, mixed with water, and pumped via a buried pipeline to the mouth of Santa Ynez Canyon. The pipeline would continue from there along the ocean floor to an offshore buoy where it would be load on board a waiting ship. Criticism of the plan grew and eventually garnered the ire of local resident Will Rogers who parodied the plan on the front page of the ""L.A. Times"". The debate raged citywide with such notable public figures as William Mulholland coming to Bell’s defense.  In an attempt to sway public opinion, Bell urged local residents to take company-sponsored fieldtrips, on foot and on horseback, to the quarry to see the site for themselves. Among the people who took these trips was Sylvia Morrison, who had been an early leader of environmental concerns. She was among the visitors who scrambled up the limestone cliffs on ladders and hiked and rode on horseback through the chaparral and came away thrilled with the natural beauty of the canyons. “Taking a cue from Yellowstone National Park, Morrison urged the establishment of Whitestone National Park in the Santa Monica Mountains, named after the by-now infamous cliffs.” Fredrick Law Olmsted. In 1930 Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., a lifelong advocate of national parks and considered by many as the designer of the California State Parks system, proposed a network of parks, beaches, playgrounds, and forests to promote the social, economic, and environmental vitality of Los Angeles. Olmsted also advocated for public ownership of at least 10,000 acres of the most scenic beach and mountain landscapes between Topanga and Point Dume. However, the Olmsted report was essentially killed – only 200 copies were printed – due mainly to civic leaders who put politics ahead of public space. Rindge bankruptcy. After lengthy court battles to preserve her estate, May Rindge (widow of Frederick H. Rindge) lost control of her lands and was forced into bankruptcy in 1938. A proposal to establish a large park was considered in exchange for the cancellation of $1.1 million in unpaid taxes. However, Los Angeles County refused the offer, thus missing the opportunity to acquire 17,000 acres of park lands. Will Rogers SHP. Will Rogers State Historic Park was created in 1944 marking the establishment of the first state park in the Santa Monica Mountains and the first public land created in the mountains since Griffith Park in 1896. Toyon National Park. In the 1960s and 70s, and possible as early of the 1950s, another campaign was undertaken to preserve the Santa Monica Mountains. Several proposals went before the U.S. Congress which called for the creation of Toyon National Park, referring to a dominant chaparral plant found in the area. The legislative history of Toyon National Park dates back to 1971 when Representative Alphonzo Bell, Jr. first introduced a bill in the Congress. Point Mugu State Park. The first of three large, rural state parks in the Santa Monica Mountains was established in 1967, when the State Division of Beaches and Parks, the forerunner of California State Parks, acquired title to 6,700 acres of the old Broome Ranch for $15.1 million. This property was the first acquision for Point Mugu State Park and was part of the old Rancho Guadalasca. 5,800 acres was purchased from Richard E. Danielson in 1972 for $2.1 million, nearly doubling the park's acreage. This property is situated northeast of the park's original 6,700 acres and consisted of mostly backcountry. A remaining 850-acre parcel which ajoined this property was purchased by the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area from Danielson in 1980, and is named Rancho Sierra Vista. Topanga State Park. Topanga State Park was established in 1974. The park's original name was Topanga Canyon State Park, but the name was shortened because officials reasoned that the park encompassed more than just Topanga Canyon. Malibu Creek State Park. In the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains, 20th Century Fox Movie Ranch, commonly called Century Ranch, was a 2,700-acre land acquisition of what would become Malibu Creek State Park. It was purchased by the State of California in 1974 for $4.8 million. Reagan Ranch, a 120-acre property and former home of Ronald Reagan, was included in the original Century Ranch purchase. Hope Ranch, owned by entertainer Bob Hope, which abutted Century Ranch, was purchased in 1975 for $4.1 million. After some controversy, the State Parks and Recreation Commission adopted a compromise on the classification of the Century Ranch property and official name the area Malibu Creek State Park in 1976. Establishment of the National Recreation Area. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area was established November 10, 1978, after a long campaign for preservation of the Santa Monica Mountains by local and regional conservationists. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a California state agency, was created in 1980 for the acquisition of land for preservation as open space, for wildlife and California native plants habitat preserves, and for public recreation activities. The SMMNRA is growing by 'mosaic pieces' linking critical habitats, saving unique areas, and expanding existing parks. Later Developments and Land Acquisions. The SMMNRA is part of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor; the Rim of the Valley Trail is a plan in progress for connecting the parkland and recreational areas of the Conejo, San Fernando, Simi, and La Crescenta Valleys via trailheads and trails in the mountains and valleys. Entertainer and land speculator Bob Hope created controversy in the early 1990s when he proposed to sell of Corral Canyon area land to the federal government in exchange for of federal parkland in the nearby Cheeseboro Canyon section of Santa Monica Mountains NRA, in order to build an access road to a new 'Jordan Ranch' golf course and housing development. The land swap was never completed, the Jordan Ranch became the Palo Commado Park section, and most of the land for Corral Canyon was later donated by Bob Hope.  The highly visible natural ranch land adjacent to the intersection of U.S. Route 101 and Las Virgenes Road in Calabasas, formerly the Brent's Junction area and owned by Bob Hope, was acquired by the SMM Conservancy to add to the Las Virgenes View Park of the Santa Monica Mountains NRA lands in June 2010. It is a refreshing open space seen by many traveling by, on the Route 101-Ventura Freeway now, between the San Fernando and the Conejo Valleys since the Spanish El Camino Real era. Cultural resources. In terms of cultural heritage, the Santa Monica Mountains boast a rich history of continuous human occupation dating back more than 10,000 years and contain many nationally significant prehistoric and historic sites. In fact, more than 1,000 archaeological sites are located within the boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area making it one of the highest densities of archaeological resources found in any mountain range in the world. There are twenty-six known Chumash pictograph sites with the national recreation area, all sacred to traditional Native American Indians, and include some that are among the most spectacular found anywhere. These pictographs – along with other sites – have been described by the National Park Service as “unique and a significant world heritage”. Nearly every major prehistoric and historic theme associated with human interaction and development of the western United States is represented within the park from the early hunters and gathers, to Native American Indian cultures, the Spanish mission and rancho periods, and the American homestead era. At least 73 archeological sites, historic structures, cultural landscapes, and traditional cultural properties in the Santa Monica Mountains are potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome on the famous Santa Monica Pier, which is within the national recreation area, is a National Historic Landmark, as is Will Rogers' house at Will Rogers State Historic Park (also within the national recreation area). The horsemen portrayed in the Saddle Rock Ranch Pictographs in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains are considered to be a representation of the Portola Expedition of 1769-1770, and have been determined to be eligible as a National Historic Landmark. A number of California Historical Landmarks also lay within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. These include the Site of the Port of Los Angeles Long Wharf (no. 881), Point Dume (no. 965), and the Adamson House of Malibu Lagoon State Beach (no. 966). Just outside of the national recreation area is the Stagecoach Inn (no. 659) in Newbury Park, Los Encinos State Historic Park (no. 689), and the Old Santa Monica Forestry Station (no. 840). Recreation. The Anthony C. Beilenson Interagency Visitor Center at King Gillette Ranch was opened in June 2012, and is operated by four partner agencies: National Park Service, California State Parks, Santa Monica Conservancy, Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. It is located at 26876 Mulholland Highway, Calabasas, CA, 91302. The Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center is the only site in the National Park Service dedicated to the past, present, and future of all Indian cultures. A Native American guest-host or a park ranger is on hand to answer questions from 9am to 5pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Native American workshops, programs, and art shows occur throughout the year. Satwiwa means ""bluff"" in the Chumash language and refers to the cliffs of Boney Mountain which can be seen from Satwiwa. The center is located at Rancho Sierra Vista in Newbury Park. Main Entrance cross street is Via Goleta and Potrero Road. The main headquarters for the park is located at 401 West Hillcrest Drive, Thousand Oaks 91360. Recreational opportunities abound, including biking, birding, camping, hiking, and horseback riding. The Backbone Trail runs for nearly across the Santa Monica Mountains between Will Rogers State Park and Point Mugu State Park and is nearly complete from end to end. Channel Islands National Park lies in the Pacific Ocean directly to the west. Entrances. Main entrances to the SMMNRA include Malibu, Newbury Park, Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Woodland Hills, and Topanga, California. Parks. The following parks and areas are managed by the National Park Service in the Santa Monica Mountains NRA: The following California State Parks are located within Santa Monica Mountains NRA: State Beaches in or adjacent to Santa Monica Mountains NRA: "
wikipedia-529417," Coast Miwok  The Coast Miwok are a tribe that was the second largest group of Miwok Native American people. The Coast Miwok inhabited the general area of modern Marin County and southern Sonoma County in Northern California, from the Golden Gate north to Duncans Point and eastward to Sonoma Creek. The Coast Miwok included the Bodega Bay Miwok from authenticated Miwok villages around Bodega Bay and Marin Miwok. Culture. The Coast Miwok spoke their own ""Coast Miwok"" language in the Utian linguistic group. They lived by hunting and gathering, and lived in small bands without centralized political authority. In the springtime they would head to the coasts to hunt salmon and other seafood, including seaweed. Otherwise their staple foods were primarily acorns—particularly from black and tan oak–nuts and wild game, such as deer and cottontail rabbits and black-tailed deer, ""Odocoileus hemionus columbianus"", a coastal subspecies of the California mule deer, ""Odocoileus hemionus"". When hunting deer, Miwok hunters traditionally used Brewer's angelica, ""Angelica breweri"" to eliminate their own scent. Miwok did not typically hunt bears. Yerba buena leaf tea were used medicinally. Tattooing was a traditional practice among Coast Miwok, and they burned poison-oak for a pigment. Their traditional houses were constructed with slabs of redwood bark. Miwok people are skilled at basketry. A recreated Coast Miwok village called Kule Loklo is located at the Point Reyes National Seashore. Language. The Coast Miwok language is no longer natively spoken, but the Bodega dialect is documented in Callaghan (1970). Religion. The original Coast Miwok people world view included animism, and one form of this took was the Kuksu religion that was evident in Central and Northern California. This included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty rites of passage, shamanic intervention with the spirit world and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms. Kuksu was shared with other indigenous ethnic groups of Central California, such as their neighbors the Pomo, also Maidu, Ohlone, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts. However Kroeber observed less ""specialized cosmogony"" in the Miwok, which he termed one of the ""southern Kuksu-dancing groups"", in comparison to the Maidu and other northern California tribes. Coast Miwok mythology and narratives were similar to those of other natives of Central and Northern California. The Coast Miwok believed in animal and human spirits, and saw the animal spirits as their ancestors. Coyote was seen as their ancestor and creator god. In their case the earth began with land formed out of the Pacific Ocean. Traditional narratives. In their myths, legends, tales, and histories, the Coast Miwok participated in the general cultural pattern of Central California. Authentic villages. The authenticated Coast Miwok villages are: History. Documentation of Miwok peoples dates back as early as 1579 by a priest on a ship under the command of Francis Drake. Other verification of occupancy exists from Spanish and Russian voyagers between 1595 and 1808. Over 1000 prehistoric charmstones and numerous arrowheads have been unearthed at Tolay Lake in Southern Sonoma County - some dating back 4000 years. The lake was thought to be a sacred site and ceremonial gathering and healing place for the Miwok and others in the region.  Coast Miwok would travel and camp on the coast and bays at peak fishing seasons. After the Europeans arrived in California, the population declined from diseases introduced by the Europeans. Beginning in 1783, mission ecclesiastical records show that Coast Miwok individuals began to join Mission San Francisco de Asis, now known as Mission Dolores. They started joining that mission in large numbers in 1803, when the marriages of 49 couples from their Huimen and Guaulen local tribes (San Rafael and Bolinas Bay) appeared in the Mission San Francisco Book of Marriages. Local tribes from farther and farther north along the shore of San Pablo Bay moved to Mission San Francisco through the year 1812. Then in 1814 the Spanish authorities began to split the northern groups—Alagualis, Chocoimes (alias Sonomas), Olompalis, and Petalumas—sending a portion of each group to Mission San Francisco and another portion to Mission San Jose in the southeast portion of the San Francisco Bay Area. By the end of the year 1817, 850 Coast Miwok had been converted. Mission San Rafael was founded by the Spanish Franciscans in Coast Miwok territory in the late fall of 1817. By that time the only Coast Miwok people still on their land were those on the Pacific Coast of the Marin Peninsula, from Point Reyes north to Bodega Bay. The Spanish authorities brought most of the Coast Miwoks who had been at Missions San Francisco and San Jose back north to form a founding population for Mission San Rafael. But some who had married Ohlone or Bay Miwok-speaking Mission Indians remained south of the Golden Gate. Over time in the 1820s Mission San Rafael became a mission for Coast Miwok and Pomo speakers. Mission San Francisco Solano, founded in 1823 in the Sonoma Valley (the easternmost traditional Coast Miwok region), came to be predominately a mission for Indians that spoke the Wappo or Patwin languages. At the end of the Mission period (1769–1834) the Coast Miwoks were freed from the control of the Franciscan missionaries. At the same time the Mission lands were secularized and ceded to Californios. Most Coast Miwok began to live in servitude on the ranchos for the new California land grant owners, such as those who went to work for General Mariano G. Vallejo at Rancho Petaluma Adobe. The ranch owners were dependent upon the labor pool of Indians with agricultural and ranching skills. Other Miwok chose to live independently in bands like those at Rancho Olompali and Rancho Nicasio.  In 1837, a smallpox epidemic decimated all the native populations of the Sonoma region, and the Coast Miwok population continued to decline rapidly from other diseases brought in from the Spaniards as well as the Russians at Fort Ross.  By the beginning of California statehood (1850), many Miwok of Marin and Sonoma Counties were making the best of a difficult situation by earning their livelihoods through farm labor or fishing within their traditional homelands. Others chose to work as seasonal or year-round laborers on the ranches that were rapidly passing from Mexican ownership into Anglo-American ownership. Olompali and Nicasio. After Mission San Rafael closed during the 1834-1836 period, the Mexican government deeded most of the land to Californios, but allowed the Indians ex-neophytes to own land at two locations within traditional Coast Miwok territory: Olompali and Nicasio. The Coast Miwok leader Camilo Ynitia, secured a land grant of 2 sq. leagues known as ""Rancho Olompali"", from Governor Micheltorena of Alta California in 1843, which included the prehistoric Miwok village of Olompali (his home village) and is north of present-day Novato.  The village of Olompali dates back to 500, had been a main center in 1200, and might have been the largest native village in Marin County. Ynitia held onto the ""Rancho Olompoli"" land title for 9 years, but in 1852 he sold most of the land to James Black of Marin. He retained called ""Apalacocha."" His daughter eventually sold ""Apalacocha"". The other Indian-owned rancho was at ""Rancho Nicasio"" northwest of San Rafael. Near the time of secularization (1835), the Church granted the San Rafael Christian Indians 20 leagues (80,000 acres, 320 km²) of mission lands from present-day Nicasio to the Tomales Bay. About 500 Indians relocated to ""Rancho Nicasio"". By 1850 they had but one league of land left. This radical reduction of land was a result of illegal confiscation of land by non-Indians under protest by Indian residents. In 1870, José Calistro, the last community leader at Nicasio, purchased the small surrounding parcel. Calistro died in 1875, and in 1876 the land was transferred by his will to his four children. In 1880 there were 36 Indian people at Nicasio. The population was persuaded to leave in the 1880s when Marin County curtailed funds to all Indians (except those at Marshall) who were not living at the Poor Farm, a place for ""indigent"" peoples. By the early 20th century, a few Miwok families pursued fishing for their livelihoods; one family continued commercial fishing into the 1970s, while another family maintained an oyster harvesting business. When this activity was neither in season nor profitable, Indian people of this area sought agricultural employment, which required an itinerant lifestyle. The preferred locality for such work was within Marin and Sonoma counties. Recognition. The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, formerly the Federated Coast Miwok, gained federal recognition of their tribal status in December 2000. The new tribe consists of people of both Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo descent. Population. Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. ""(See Population of Native California.)"" Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Coast Miwok at 1,500. Sherburne F. Cook raised this figure to 2,000. The population in 1848 was estimated as 300, and it had dropped to 60 in 1880. "

wikipedia-69811," Lillie Langtry  Lillie Langtry (October 13, 1853 – February 12, 1929), usually spelled Lily Langtry when she was in the U.S., born Emilie Charlotte Le Breton, achieved overnight celebrity status when, in May 1877, Lady Sebright invited her to ""an evening at home"", attended by some of the famous artists of the day. Her looks—allied to her ability to enchant those in her company—attracted interest, comments, and invitations from artists and society hostesses. By 1881, she was an actress and would star in many plays, including ""She Stoops to Conquer"", ""The Lady of Lyons"", and ""As You Like It"", eventually running her own stage production company. In later life she performed ""dramatic sketches"" in vaudeville. She was also known for her relationships with nobility, including the Prince of Wales, the Earl of Shrewsbury and Prince Louis of Battenberg. She would become the subject of much public and media interest. Biography. Born as Emilie Charlotte Le Breton, Langtry was the only daughter of Dean of Jersey, the Rev. William Corbet Le Breton. He gained an unsavoury reputation because of a number of extramarital affairs and, when his wife finally left him in 1880, he left Jersey. He had eloped to Gretna Green with Lillie's mother, Emilie Davis (née Martin), who was known for her beauty. In 1842, he married her at Chelsea. One of Langtry's ancestors was Richard le Breton, one of the reputed assassins of Thomas Becket in 1170. She was the 6th of 7 children, all of her siblings brothers; Francis Corbet Le Breton (1843–1872), William Inglis Le Breton (1846–1931), Trevor Alexander Le Breton (1847–1870), Maurice Vavasour Le Breton (1849–1881), Clement Martin Le Breton (10 January 1851 – 1 July 1927), and Reginald Le Breton (1855–1876). Of her brothers, only William and Clement did not die young from accident or disease. Clement was her last surviving brother. Proving too much for her French governess, Lillie was educated by her brothers' tutor, becoming unusually well educated for women of the time. From Jersey to London. On 6 March 1874, 20-year-old Lillie married 30-year-old Irish landowner Edward Langtry, a widower who had been married to Jane Francis. She was the sister of Elizabeth Francis, who had married Lillie's brother William. They held their wedding reception at The Royal Yacht Hotel, in St. Helier, Jersey. He was wealthy enough to own a yacht, and Lillie insisted that he take her away from the Channel Islands. Eventually, they rented an apartment in Eaton Place, Belgravia, London before moving to 17 Norfolk Street off Park Lane.  In an interview published in several newspapers (including the ""Brisbane Herald"") in 1882, Lillie Langtry said, “It was through Lord Ranleigh and the painter Frank Miles that I was first introduced to London society… I went to London and was brought out by my friends. Among the most enthusiastic of these was Mr Frank Miles, the artist. I learned afterwards that he saw me one evening at the theatre, and tried in vain to discover who I was. He went to his clubs and among his artist friends declaring he had seen a beauty, and he described me to everybody he knew, until one day one of his friends met me and he was duly introduced. Then Mr Miles came and begged me to sit for my portrait. I consented, and when the portrait was finished he sold it to Prince Leopold. From that time I was invited everywhere and made a great deal of by many members of the royal family and nobility. After Frank Miles I sat for portraits to Millais and Burne-Jones and now Frith is putting my face in one of his great pictures."" Lord Ranelagh, a friend of her father and sister-in-law, invited Lillie Langtry to a high-society reception at which she attracted notice for her beauty and wit. In contrast to more elaborate clothing, she wore a simple black dress (which was to become her trademark) and no jewellery. Before the end of the evening, Frank Miles had completed several sketches of her that became very popular on postcards. Another guest, Sir John Everett Millais, eventually painted her portrait. Langtry's nickname, the ""Jersey Lily,"" was taken from the Jersey lily flower (""Amaryllis belladonna"") – a symbol of Jersey. The nickname was popularised by Millais' portrait, entitled ""A Jersey Lily"". (According to tradition, the two Jersey natives spoke Jèrriais to each other during the sittings.) The painting caused great interest when exhibited at the Royal Academy. Langtry was portrayed holding a Guernsey lily (""Nerine sarniensis"") in the painting rather than a Jersey lily, as none were available during the sittings. She also sat for Sir Edward Poynter and is depicted in works by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. She became much sought-after in London society, and invitations flooded in. Her fame soon reached royal ears. Acting career. Short of money, and at the suggestion by her close friend Oscar Wilde, Lillie embarked upon a stage career. She first tried out in an amateur production in the Twickenham Town Hall. It was a comedy two-hander called ""A Fair Encounter"", with Henrietta Labouchere taking the other role and coaching Lillie in her acting. Henrietta was formerly a professional actress (Henrietta Hodson) before she met and married Liberal MP Henry Labouchere. Following favorable reviews of this first attempt at the stage - and with further coaching - Langtry made her debut before the London public, playing Kate Hardcastle in ""She Stoops to Conquer"" at the Haymarket Theatre in 1881. Critical opinion was mixed, but she was a success with the public, and her next production ""Ours"" was at the same theatre. Early in 1882, Langtry quit the production team at the Haymarket and started her own company, touring the UK with various plays, still under the tutelage of Henrietta Labouchere.  American impresario Henry Abbey arranged an American tour for Langtry, and she arrived in October 1882 to be met by the press and Oscar Wilde, who was in New York on a lecture tour. Her first appearance was eagerly anticipated, but the theatre burnt down the night before the opening; the show was transferred and opened the following week. Eventually, her production company started a coast-to-coast tour of the USA, ending in May 1883 with a “fat profit”. Before leaving New York, she had broken with Henrietta Labouchere on acrimonious terms over Langtry's relationship with young American millionaire Freddie Gebhard. Her first tour of the United States (accompanied by Gebhard) was an enormous success, which she repeated in subsequent years. While the critics generally condemned her interpretations of roles such as Pauline in ""The Lady of Lyons"" or Rosalind in ""As You Like It"", the public loved her. On her return from New York in 1883, she registered at the Consevatoire in Paris for six weeks' intensive training to improve her acting technique. In 1889, she took on the part of Lady Macbeth in “The Scottish Play”. In 1903, she starred in the US in ""The Crossways"", written by her in collaboration with J. Hartley Manners. She returned to the United States for tours in 1906 and again in 1912, appearing in vaudeville. She last appeared on the stage in America in 1917, and made her final appearance in the theatre some months later in London. Personal life. Royal mistress. The Prince of Wales, Albert Edward (""Bertie"", later Edward VII), arranged to sit next to Langtry at a dinner party given by Sir Allen Young on May 24, 1877. (Her husband Edward was seated at the other end of the table.) Although the Prince was married to Princess Alexandra and had six children, he was a well-known philanderer. He became infatuated with Langtry, and she soon became his semiofficial mistress. She was even presented to the Prince's mother, Queen Victoria. Eventually, a cordial relationship developed between Princess Alexandra and her.  The affair lasted from late 1877 to June 1880. The Prince of Wales had the Red House (now Langtry Manor Hotel) constructed in Bournemouth, then in Hampshire, in 1877 as a private retreat for the couple and allowed Langtry to design it. He once complained to her, ""I've spent enough on you to build a battleship"", whereupon she tartly replied, ""And you've spent enough in me to float one"". The folklore is that their relationship finally cooled when she misbehaved at a dinner party, but she had been eclipsed when Sarah Bernhardt came to London in June 1879. In July 1879, Langtry began an affair with the Earl of Shrewsbury; in January 1880, Langtry and the earl were planning to run away together. In the autumn of 1879, rumours were published in ""Town Talk"" that her husband would divorce her and cite, with others, the Prince of Wales as co-respondent. For some time, the Prince saw little of her. He remained fond of her and spoke well of her in her later career as a theatre actress. With the withdrawal of royal favour, creditors closed in. The Langtrys' finances were not equal to their lifestyle. In October 1880, Langtry sold many of her possessions to meet her debts, but Edward Langtry did not officially declare bankruptcy. Daughter. In April 1879, Langtry had an affair with Prince Louis of Battenberg, while she was involved with Arthur Clarence Jones (1854–1930), an old friend. In June 1880, she became pregnant. Her husband was not the father; she led Prince Louis to believe that it was he. When the prince told this to his parents, they had him assigned to the warship HMS ""Inconstant"". Given some money by the Prince of Wales, Langtry retired to Paris with Arthur Jones. On March 8, 1881, she gave birth to a daughter, Jeanne Marie. The discovery of Langtry's passionate letters to Arthur Jones in 1978 and their publication by Laura Beatty in 1999 support the idea that Jones was the father. Prince Louis's son, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, had always maintained that his father was the father of Jeanne Marie. In 1902, Jeanne Marie married the Scottish politician, Sir Ian Malcolm. They had four children. Lady Malcolm died in 1964. Her daughter Mary Malcolm was one of the first two female announcers on the BBC Television Service (now BBC One) from 1948 to 1956, during which time she became a household name in the UK. She died on 13 October 2010 at the age of 92. Her son Ian Malcolm was the first husband of the English actress Ann Todd. Thoroughbred racing. From 1882 to 1891, Langtry had a relationship with the New York City millionaire Frederic Gebhard. With him, she became involved in the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing. In 1885, she and Gebhard brought a stable of American horses to race in England. On August 13, 1888, Langtry and Gebhard traveled in her private car attached to an Erie Railroad express train bound for Chicago. Another railcar was transporting 17 of their horses when it derailed at Shohola, Pennsylvania at 1:40 am. Rolling down an embankment, it burst into flames. One person died in the fire, along with Gebhard's champion runner Eole and 14 racehorses belonging to Langtry and him. One of the two horses to survive the wreck was St. Saviour. He was named for St. Saviour's Church in Jersey, where Langtry's father had been rector and where the actress chose to be buried.  In 1889, Langtry met “an eccentric young bachelor, with vast estates in Scotland, a large breeding stud, a racing stable, and more money than he knew what to do with”: he was George Alexander Baird or Squire Abington as he came to be known. His money had come from the industry of his grandfather and seven of his sons who developed coal and iron workings. Baird’s father had died when he was a young boy, leaving him a fortune in trust; in addition, he inherited the estates of two equally wealthy uncles who had died childless. Langtry and Baird met at a race course when he gave her a betting tip and the stake money to place on the horse. The horse won and at a later luncheon party Baird also offered her the gift of a horse called Milford. She at first demurred, but others at the table advised her to accept, as this horse was a very fine prospect. The horse duly won several races under Langtry’s colours of “Mr Jersey” (women were excluded from registering horses at this time). Langtry became involved in a relationship with Baird, from 1891 until his death in March 1893.  When Baird died, Langtry purchased two of his horses at the dipersal sale: Lady Rosebery and Studley Royal. She moved her training to Sam Pickering’s stables at Kentford House and took a residence called Regal Lodge in Kentford, Suffolk.  Langtry found mentors in the shape of Captain James Octavius Machell and Joe Thompson, who provided guidance on all matters related to the turf, and when her trainer Pickering failed to deliver results, she moved her expanded string of 20 horses to Fred Webb at Exning. She was made aware of a horse for sale in Australia called Merman that she purchased and shipped to England; this was at some risk, as she had already had a bad experience of a horse being transported in this way (Maluma). Merman was regarded as one of the best “stayers” and eventually went on to win the Lewes Handicap, the Cesarewitch, Jockey Club Cup, Goodwood Stakes, Goodwood Cup, and Ascot Gold Cup (with Tod Sloan up). She later had a second Cesarewitch winner with Yentoi and a third place with Raytoi. An imported horse, this time from New Zealand called Uniform, won the Lewes Handicap for her.  Other trainers used by Langtry were Jack Robinson, who trained at Foxhill, in Wiltshire and a very young Fred Darling whose first big success was Yentoi's 1908 Caesarwitch.  Langtry owned a stud at Gazely, Newmarket, however, this venture was not a success, and after a few years, she gave up attempts to breed blood-stock.  Before moving to Monaco, Langtry sold Regal Lodge and all her horse-racing interests. Regal Lodge had received many celebrated guests, not least the Prince of Wales. American citizenship. Langtry became an American citizen in 1897. She divorced her husband Edward Langtry the same year in Lakeport, California, and he died a few months later following an accident. A letter of condolence later written by Langtry to another widow reads in part, ""I too have lost a husband, but alas! it was no great loss."" In 1888, Langtry purchased a winery with an area of in Lake County, California, which produced red wine. She sold it in 1906. Bearing the Langtry Farms name, the winery and vineyard are still in operation in Middletown, California.  In 1899, she married the much younger Hugo Gerald de Bathe. He inherited a baronetcy and became a leading owner in the horse-racing world, before retiring to Monte Carlo. During her final years, Langtry resided in Monaco, with her husband living a short distance away. The two saw one another only when she called on him for social gatherings or in brief private encounters. Final Days. Her companion during this time in Monaco was her close friend, Mathilde Marie Peate, the widow of her butler. Peate was at Langtry's side during the final days of her life as she died of pneumonia in Monte Carlo. She would also be one of the beneficiaries in Langtry's will, being left £10,000, the villa - known as Le Lys Monaco - clothes and even her motor car. Langtry died in Monaco at dawn Tuesday 12 February 1929. She had asked to be buried in her parents' tomb at St. Saviour's Church in Jersey. Due to blizzards, it was not possible to move her body immediately, but finally she was taken to St Malo and across to Jersey on 22 February on the steamer ""Saint Brieuc"". Her coffin laid in St Saviour's overnight surrounded by flowers and she was buried on the afternoon of 23 February. Pictures of the funeral may be viewed at http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Lillie_Langtry Cultural influence and portrayals. Langtry used her high public profile to endorse commercial products such as cosmetics and soap, an early example of celebrity endorsement. Her famous ivory complexion brought her income as the first woman to endorse a commercial product, advertising Pears Soap. Her fee was allied to her weight, so she was paid 'pound for pound'. Scholars believe the fictitious Irene Adler in ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" (1891), the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" short story, who outwitted the private investigator when he sought an incriminating photograph of her and a European monarch, is based upon Langtry. In the 1944 Universal film ""The Scarlet Claw"", Lillian Gentry, the initial murder victim, wife of Lord William Penrose and former actress, is an oblique reference to Langtry. Langtry's life story has been portrayed in film numerous times. Lillian Bond played her in ""The Westerner"" (1940), and Ava Gardner in ""The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean"" (1972). Judge Roy Bean, a famous American frontier admirer, was played by Walter Brennan in the former and Paul Newman in the latter film, both times as a man with a lifelong obsession with the beauty. In 1967, the Who released ""Pictures of Lily"" as a single. According to Pete Townshend, the song was ""merely a ditty about masturbation and the importance of it to a young man. it's all about a boy who can't sleep at night, so his dad gives him some dirty pictures to look at. then he falls in love with the girl in the pictures which is too bad because she is dead"". Lillie Langtry, the music hall star, died in 1929, the year referred to in the song. In 1978, Langtry's story was dramatised by London Weekend Television and produced as ""Lillie"", starring Francesca Annis in the title role. Annis had previously played Langtry in two episodes of ATV's ""Edward the Seventh"". Jenny Seagrove played her in the 1991 made-for-television film ""Incident at Victoria Falls"". A drastically fictional version of Langtry was performed by Stacy Haiduk in the 1996 television series """". In the series, Langtry was portrayed as the immortal leader of a sect of vampires living in the present day. Langtry is a featured character in the ""tongue-in-cheek"" western novel, ""Slocum and the Jersey Lily"" by Jake Logan. She figures prominently in ""Death at Epsom Downs"" by Robin Paige, the pseudonym of Bill and Susan Wittig Albert, who wrote a series of Victorian novels based on historic people. Langtry is a featured character in the fictional Flashman novels of acclaimed writer George Macdonald Fraser mentioned as a former lover of arch cad Harry Flashman. Flashman describes her as one of his few true loves. Langtry is used as a touchstone for old-fashioned manners in Preston Sturges's comedy ""The Lady Eve"" (1941), in a scene where a corpulent woman drops a handkerchief on the floor and the hero ignores it. Jean Barbara Stanwyck begins to describe, comment, and even anticipate the events that we see reflected in her hand mirror. Jean says: ""The dropped kerchief! That hasn't been used since Lily Langtry ... you'll have to pick it up yourself, madam ... it's a shame, but he doesn't care for the flesh, he'll never see it"" (Pirolini 2010). The song ""Lily Langtry"" appears in a few albums by the folk group New Christy Minstrels. Langtry was possibly the subject of The Who's 1967 song, ""Pictures of Lily"", about a young man infatuated by the image of a woman named Lily; the fact that her death occurred in 1929 (as mentioned in the song) gives credence to this theory. A British feature film used the song title ""Pictures of Lily"" in 2011. In ""The Simpsons"" episode in which Montgomery Burns auditions children to be his new heir, the theatre in which the auditions are held on Burns' estate is called the Lillie Langtry Theater. Places connected with Lillie Langtry. When first married (1874), Edward and Lillie Langtry had a property called Cliffe Lodge in Southampton. Lillie Langtry lived at 21 Pont Street, London from 1892 to 1897. Although from 1895 the building was actually the Cadogan Hotel, she would stay in her old bedroom there. A blue plaque (which erroneously states that she was born in 1852) on the hotel commemorates this, and the hotel's restaurant is named 'Langtry's' in her honour. While she was Edward VII's mistress, Lillie Langtry frequently performed at the in-house theatre of a hotel on 1–9 Inverness Terrace, in Bayswater, on the north side of Hyde Park, London W2. The in-house theatre is known as 'Lillie's theatre'. A grade II listed building, the hotel was originally built by Ritz architects Charles Mewès and Arthur Davis and continues to function as a hotel today – renamed 'The Jones Hotel', its in-house theatre continues as the venue for nightly cabaret-style performances. The hotel is now named the Grand Royale London Hyde Park – part of The Shaftesbury Hotels company.  The Langtry Manor Hotel (now a boutique hotel) is located at Derby Road in Bournemouth, now in Dorset. The Manor House was built in 1877 by the future Edward VII and was used as a love nest for them. It is now a hotel/restaurant and run by Tara Howard, it is one of Lorraine Kelly's top 20 Wedding venues. Also according to Paranormal Dorset by Roger Guttridge a female presence has been felt in the Manor House at 4pm in the kitchen, which is the time when Langtry would make her afternoon tea. Lillie had a dwelling in Alexandra Road called Leighton House, possibly demolished in the 1970s to make way for the Alexandra Road Estate. She is remembered in the area in the name of Langtry Walk and a local pub. Lillie was a cousin of the local politician Philip Le Breton, pioneer for the preservation of Hampstead Heath. Steam yacht ""White Ladye"". Langtry owned a luxury steam auxiliary yacht called ""White Ladye"" from 1891 to 1897. The yacht was built in 1891 for Lord Asburton by Ramage & Ferguson of Leith from a design by W C Storey. She had 3 masts, was 204 feet in length and 27 in breadth and was powered by a 142 hp steam engine. She had originally been named ""Ladye Mabel"".  In 1893 Ogden Geolet leased the vessel from Langtry and used it until his death in 1897. It was then sold at auction to John Lawson Johnston the 'inventor' of Bovril and remained in his ownership until his death on board in Cannes France in 1900. In 1902/3 she was recorded in the Lloyd's Yacht Register as being owned by shipbuilder William Cresswell Gray, Tunstall Manor, West Hartlepool and remained so until 1915. Following this the Lloyd's Register records that she became French trawler ""La Champagne"" based in Fécamp and was broken up in 1935. "
wikipedia-367762," Kroger  The Kroger Company is an American retailer founded by Bernard Kroger in 1883 in Cincinnati, Ohio.  It is the country's largest grocery store chain, second-largest general retailer by revenue, and fourth-largest retailer in the world (surpassing Germany-based Metro AG in 2012), according to Deloitte. As of 2010, Kroger operated, either directly or through its subsidiaries, 2,435 stores. Kroger's headquarters are in downtown Cincinnati. It maintains markets in 31 states, with store formats that include supermarkets, superstores, department stores, convenience stores, and mall jewelry stores. Kroger-branded grocery stores are located throughout the Midwestern and Southern United States. Kroger also is parent to several ""banner"" chains, such as Ralphs in California. Kroger's employees are mostly represented by collective bargaining agreements. Seventy-five percent of Kroger employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). History. Beginning. In 1883, Bernard 'Barney' Kroger invested his life savings of $372 (roughly equal to $ today) to open a grocery store in the Mount Airy neighborhood of Cincinnati. Kroger was the son of a merchant, and his slogan was simple: ""Be particular. Never sell anything you would not want yourself."" Kroger tried many ways to satisfy customers. He tried to make his own products, such as bread, so that customers would not need to go to a separate bakery. In 1929, there were rumors of a Safeway-Kroger merger. In the 1930s, Kroger was the first grocery chain to monitor product quality and test foods offered to customers, and also the first to have a store surrounded on all four sides by parking lots. 1940s-1970s. In the mid-1950s, Kroger entered the Houston, Texas market by acquiring the Houston-based chain Henke & Pillot. Nearly around the same time Kroger acquired Krambo of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area, and Child's. The stores were eventually converted to the Kroger banner in the mid-1960s. Kroger exited Milwaukee in the 1970s. Speculation occurred that it would return to Milwaukee in 2008, when Roundy's was rumored to be for sale, but it never happened. Kroger opened stores in Florida under the SupeRx and Florida Choice banners from the 1960s until 1986, when the chain decided to exit the state and sold all of its stores; Kash n' Karry bought the largest share. Recently, retail analysts have begun to speculate about whether Kroger may capitalize on the misfortunes of Albertsons and Food Lion and re-enter Florida again, but the dominance of native Publix, Winn-Dixie and the growing force of Walmart in Florida would be a tough sell for Kroger. In the 1970s, Kroger became the first grocer in America to test an electronic scanner, and the first to formalize consumer research. Although Kroger has long operated stores in the Huntsville-Decatur area of northern Alabama (as a southern extension of its Nashville, Tennessee, region), it has not operated in the state's largest market, Birmingham, since the early 1970s, when it exited as a result of intense competition from Winn-Dixie and local chains Bruno's Supermarkets and Western Supermarkets. Kroger entered the Charlotte market in 1977 and expanded rapidly throughout the 1980s when it bought some stores from BI-LO. However, most stores were in less desirable neighborhoods and did not fit in with Kroger's upscale image. Less than three months after BI-LO pulled out, that company decided to re-enter the Charlotte market, and in 1988 Kroger announced it would leave the Charlotte market and put its stores up for sale. In an ironic twist, BI-LO bought Kroger's remaining stores in the Charlotte area. 1980s. Kroger opened a number of stores in the Western Pennsylvania region, encompassing Pittsburgh and surrounding areas until the early 1980s, when the U.S. began experiencing a severe economic recession. The recession had two significant and related effects on Kroger's operations in the region. First, the highly cyclical manufacturing-based economy of the region declined in greater proportion than the rest of the U.S., which undercut demand for the higher-end products and services offered by Kroger. The second effect of the economic recession was to worsen labor-management relations which led to a protracted labor strike in 1983 and 1984. During the strike, Kroger withdrew all of its stores from the Western Pennsylvania market, including some recently opened ""superstores"" and ""greenhouses."" The new superstores in Western Pennsylvania, which included at least the one at North Huntingdon Township (Irwin, Pa.) and another at Cranberry Township, were Kroger's state-of-the-art facilities. They were equipped with optical (bar-code) check-out scanners that were new to the industry, and especially to the region. In addition to the usual meat/dairy/produce departments, they contained a separate bakery, deli, cheese shop, and seafood counter, amenities that have come to define the modern suburban grocery store. In an innovation that did not define future trends, the new superstores also included extensive non-foods departments that sold among other things, televisions, and other electronics. Hence, the closure of these newly opened, trend-setting facilities represented an abrupt retreat in the region. Kroger's exit ceded the market to lower-cost, locally owned rivals, most notably Giant Eagle and the Supervalu-supplied Shop 'n Save and FoodLand chains. (Ironically, Kroger bought Eagle Grocery company, whose founders went on to create Giant Eagle.) Kroger still maintains a presence in the nearby Morgantown, West Virginia, Wheeling, West Virginia, and Weirton, West Virginia/Steubenville, Ohio areas where Giant Eagle has a much smaller presence and the Supervalu-supplied stores are virtually nonexistent, though in all of these cases Walmart remains a major competitor and Aldi is the only other supermarket with any market overlap. Kroger entered the competitive San Antonio, Texas market in 1980 but pulled out in mid-1993. On June 15, 1993, the company announced it would close its 15 area stores 60 days later. The chain closed several stores around Flint, Michigan in 1981, which were converted by local businessman Al Kessel to a new chain called Kessel Food Markets. Kroger bought most of these stores back in 1999 and began reverting them. Several other Michigan stores were sold to another Flint-based chain, Hamady Brothers, in 1980. The Hamady acquisition was short-lived. In 1983, The Kroger Company acquired Dillon Companies grocery chain in Kansas along with its subsidiaries, King Soopers, City Market, Fry's, Gerbes, and the convenience store chain Kwik Shop. David Dillon, a fourth-generation descendant of J.S. Dillon, the founder of Dillon Companies, is now the CEO of Kroger. In the 1990s, Kroger acquired Great Scott (Detroit), Pay Less Food Markets, Owen's Market, JayC Food Stores, and Hilander Foods. In northeastern Ohio, Kroger had a plant in Solon, Ohio, which is a suburb of Cleveland, until the mid-1980s. When that plant shut down, Kroger closed its northeastern Ohio stores in the Cleveland, Akron and Youngstown areas. Some of those former Kroger stores were taken over by stores like Acme Fresh Markets, Giant Eagle and Heinens. Kroger opened and had about 50 stores in St. Louis until it left the market in 1986, saying that its stores were unprofitable. Most of its stores were bought by National, Schnucks, and Shop 'n Save. Safeway (excluding the Randalls chain) exited the Houston market in early 1988. It sold many of its own properties to Kroger, the market leader in the region, which is still followed by Randalls (now owned by Safeway) today. Kroger also experienced a similar withdrawal from Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1989. Many of these stores were sold to the local grocery chain Red Food, which was in turn bought by BI-LO in 1994. Today, Chattanooga is the only metropolitan market in Tennessee in which Kroger does not operate. 1990s and beyond. In 1997, Kroger merged with the then fifth-largest grocery company Fred Meyer, along with its' subsidiaries, Ralphs, QFC, and Smith's. In the late 1990s, it acquired many stores from Super Fresh as it exited many markets in the South. Kroger also swapped all ten of its Greensboro, N.C.-area stores in 1999 to Matthews, N.C.-based Harris Teeter for 11 of that company's stores in central and western Virginia. Kroger still maintains a North Carolina presence in the Raleigh-Durham area. In the Raleigh-Durham area, Kroger closed its North Raleigh store in the Wakefield Commons shopping center on July 9, 2011 because the location failed to meet sales expectations. After the closure, Kroger will operate 16 stores in the Triangle. Kroger had a store in Greenville from the 1980s until 2010 when it sold it to Harris Teeter. A store in Wilson opened in 2002, but closed two years later. Long the dominant grocer in western Virginia, Kroger entered the Richmond, Virginia market in 2000, where it competes against market leaders Martin's (including former Ukrop's stores) and Food Lion. Kroger entered the market by purchasing Hannaford stores that either already existed or were being built in Richmond. Hannaford purchases also included the competitive Hampton Roads market where it now competes with Farm Fresh, Harris Teeter, and Food Lion. The Hannaford locations in these markets were purchased from Delhaize by Kroger as a condition of Delhaize's 2000 acquisition of the Hannaford chain, which had previously competed against Food Lion, also owned by Delhaize. Wal-Mart Supercenters are also major competitors in both markets, and the chain briefly competed against Winn-Dixie, which has now exited Virginia. In 2001, Kroger acquired Baker's from Fleming Companies, Inc. Albertsons exited the San Antonio and Houston markets in early 2002, selling many of the Houston stores to Kroger. In 2004, Kroger bought most of the old Thriftway stores in Cincinnati, Ohio, when Winn-Dixie left the area. These stores were reopened as Kroger stores. In 2007, Kroger acquired Scott's Food & Pharmacy from SuperValu Inc. In August 2010, Kroger and Publix are among potential bidders for the aforementioned BI-LO chain in the southeast. Neither of those chains, however, would give additional details. In 2011, Kroger sold its Hilander chain to Schnucks. Schnucks has since rebranded the chain. On July 9, 2013, Kroger announced its acquisition of the 212 stores of North Carolina-based Harris Teeter in a deal valued at $2.5 billion and assume $100 million in the company's outstanding debt. Harris-Teeter's stores are in eight Southern states, with a major portion of them in its headquarters state of North Carolina. Doing so, Kroger acquired Harris Teeter’s click and collect program which allows online ordering of groceries. Some industry experts see this as a competitive move against online grocers such as AmazonFresh. On July 27, 2013, Kroger was rumored to be interested in purchasing the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A&P). Such a deal would provide Kroger new markets in the Northeast, where it has no presence. On September 20, 2013, It was announced that David Dillon would be retiring as CEO of the Kroger Co. effective January 1, 2014 to be succeeded as CEO by W. Rodney McMullen, current COO of the company, and that David Dillon would remain on as Chairman of the Board through the end of 2014. Spouse insurance benefits cut. In 2013, Kroger announced the spouses of company's unionized workers would no longer be covered by the company's insurance plan. The company cited The Affordable Care Act as a prime reason for the move. The benefit cut affects roughly 11,000 workers in Indiana. The company announced in April 2013 that full-time employees would maintain their health insurance benefits. Kroger Marketplace. Kroger Marketplace is a chain of big-box stores. The brand was introduced in 2004 in the Columbus, Ohio area, which lost the Big Bear and Big Bear Plus chains in Penn Traffic's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Kroger Marketplace format is based on the Fry's Marketplace stores that the Arizona division of Kroger is currently operating. Similar to rival chains Meijer, Sears Grand, Super Kmart, Walmart Supercenter, and Albertson's, and modeled after Kroger-owned Fred Meyer, these stores contain multiple departments. In addition to the grocery department, they contain a Fred Meyer Jewelers, Starbucks, Donatos Pizza, and an in-store bank, as well as sections for toys, appliances, home furnishings, and bed and bath, something that Big Bear once had in their stores in the Columbus area. In 2005, the company began renovating many ""Kroger Food & Drug"" stores in Ohio to give out an expanded and remodeled look, converting them to the ""Kroger Marketplace"" format. In February 2006, Kroger announced plans for two new Kroger Marketplace stores to open by the end of the summer in Cincinnati suburbs Lebanon and Liberty Township. The store in Liberty Township opened in July 2006. On October 5, 2006, a new Kroger Marketplace opened in Gahanna. With the Gahanna opening, the number of Kroger Marketplace stores is six, four in the Columbus area and two in the Cincinnati area. Two more stores were planned in 2007, one in Middletown(which opened in April 2007 after the old store was razed and made part of the current parking lot) and one in Englewood. In 2011 the Elder Beerman in Centerville, Ohio was torn down and a new marketplace has been built in its place with a fuel center and opened on December 8, replacing the 60,000 square foot store in the same shopping center. This newest marketplace is the largest Kroger store ever built to date at 147,000 square feet. Two more stores have opened in the Cincinnati area, in the Northern Kentucky suburbs of Hebron and Walton which were completed in November 2008. A Kroger Marketplace store has opened in Newport, Kentucky on December 10, 2009. Another renovated store has recently opened in Blue Ash, and two more opened in Lexington, Kentucky, in 2009. Another store has been opened in Beavercreek, Ohio. A Mt. Orab, Ohio store is planned to open in the spring of 2010. Kroger opened a new store in North Augusta, South Carolina. The store includes a fuel center. The first Kroger Marketplace store in Texas opened October 9, 2009, in the Waterside Marketplace in Richmond, Texas. The second Kroger Marketplace store in Rosenberg, Texas opened December 4, 2009. The third opened in Frisco, Texas in early 2010. The fourth Kroger Marketplace in Willis, Texas opened August 11, 2011. The next Kroger Marketplace stores in Texas are: in Little Elm, Texas; Fort Worth's Alliance Town Center; Wylie, Texas and Mansfield. Also recently added to the list is Wylie, Texas. The first Kroger Marketplace store in Tennessee opened in Farragut, Tennessee (a small suburb outside of Knoxville) at the end of 2008, and a second store in Thompson's Station, Tennessee, (about south of Nashville) in early 2009. A third location opened in Gallatin, Tennessee, on March 11, 2010. On February 11, 2010, Kroger sold 4 Brookshire's stores in Jackson, Mississippi, which were Albertsons. The first Kroger Marketplace in Arkansas opened in August 2010 on Chenal Parkway in Little Rock, Arkansas. The first Kroger Marketplace in Virginia opened on Midlothian Turnpike in Richmond, Virginia, on the site of the former Cloverleaf Mall on December 6, 2012. Another Marketplace opened in Virginia Beach, Virginia, at the site of a former Super K-mart, on July 31, 2013. The first Kroger Marketplace in Indiana opened on September 29, 2011, on Dupont Road on Fort Wayne's northwest side. This store is a rebuilt Kroger Food & Drug. A second Kroger Marketplace opened on October 4, 2012 from a rebuilt Scott's Food and Pharmacy in the Village at Coventry on the southwest side of Fort Wayne. These two stores are part of a $100 million expansion project in the Fort Wayne area. Manufacturing. In addition to stocking a variety of regional brand products, The Kroger Company also employs one of the largest networks of private label manufacturing in the country. Forty plants (either wholly owned or used with operating agreements) in seventeen states create about half of Kroger's nearly 20,000 private label products. Similar to most major supermarket retailers, Kroger uses a three-tiered private label marketing strategy. One private brand emphasizes no-frills products at the lowest possible price, another is intended to be comparable to leading national brands but a better value, and the third is a premium–often organic–brand. Manufacturing Plants. Kroger operates 40 manufacturing plants and packages and sells items for other retailers under the Inter-American Products Company name. Dairies. Kroger operates 15 dairies and three ice cream plants Private Brands. Kroger Value. The Kroger Value line of products was introduced in 1981 by the name of Cost Cutter and was known for its near-generic product labeling. It was then succeeded by FMV, which was a backronym to mean For Maximum Value, originally meaning Fred Meyer Value. It offered staple products such as sugar, flour, bread, and canned goods at the lowest price for that particular product in the store. Though some FMV products (such as their cheese made with water and partially hydrogenated soybean oil) use a lower-quality manufacturing process, other products appear to be indistinguishable from their banner brand equivalent (FMV sugar and Kroger sugar, for example) other than the price. In early 2007, Kroger replaced FMV with the new Kroger Value brand. This has led to a situation where Kroger brand and Kroger Value brand products are sold side-by-side with little to distinguish them except for packaging and price. The brand change departed from the typical orange-fade-to-yellow labels and is now simply white with blue and red. Since then Kroger has expanded the line to many other items, such as frozen food, butter, dog and cat food, ice cream, paper towels, bleach, and other food and household items. Most Kroger Value brand items are bilingually labeled (in English and Spanish). Banner Brands. Banner Brands, goods that bear the name of Kroger or its subsidiaries (i.e., Ralphs, King Soopers, etc.) or make reference to them (i.e., Big K) are offered with a ""Try it, Like it, or Get the National Brand Free"" guarantee, where if the customer does not believe the Kroger brand product is as good as the national brand, they can exchange the unused portion of the product with their receipt for the equivalent national brand for free. Many of Kroger's health and beauty goods, one of the company's fastest-growing private label categories, are manufactured by third-party providers; these products include goods like ibuprofen and contact lens solution. Private Selection. Products marked Private Selection are offered to compare with gourmet brands or regional brands that may be considered more upscale than the standard Kroger brand products. While the Private Selection name includes many products, two of the most popular Private Selection items are ice cream and deli meat. Simple Truth Organic. Simple Truth Organic is a brand offered to compare with other organic brands Other private label brands. As well as the major grocery brands, Kroger's manufacturing creates a variety of general merchandise brands. These are featured especially in Fred Meyer stores, where more than half the goods sold are non-food, or in the smaller Fred Meyer-based Marketplace stores. The following brands might be found in various Kroger-owned stores: Bread Dairy Deli Drug & General Merchandise Frozen Food Grocery and General Merchandise Whole Health (Nutrition) i-wireless (Wireless Services). i-wireless is a national wireless service provider sold in over 2,200 retail locations within the Kroger family of stores across 31 states. i-wireless allows customers to accrue minutes on their i-wireless phone in exchange for using their shopper's card on qualifying purchases. The i-wireless service functions over the Nationwide Sprint Network. Customers can choose from monthly, unlimited, or pay-per-use plans that do not have contracts, activation fees, or the ability to roam. Disney Magic Selections. In 2006, Kroger partnered with the consumer products division of The Walt Disney Company to add the ""Disney Magic Selections"" line to its private label offerings. In reality, many of these products have been substituted in place of Kroger's Signature brand equivalents on the shelf, often with an increase in price. With packaging featuring animated Disney and Pixar characters, such as Mickey Mouse as Chef Mickey, these products are marketed to help promote healthy eating among children. Most of the approximately one hundred initial products contain zero grams of trans fat and include food offerings such as yogurt, breakfast foods, and small fresh fruit cups. This product offering was phased out and re-replaced with Kroger Brand product. Pharmacy Group. Kroger previously owned and operated the SupeRx drug store chain. In 1985, Kroger outbid Rite Aid for the Hook's Drug Stores chain, based in Indianapolis, IN, and combined it with SupeRx to become Hook's-SupeRx. In 1994, Kroger decided to get out of the stand-alone drug-store business, and sold its SupeRx stores to Revco, which later was sold to CVS. Today, Kroger operates more than 1,900 pharmacies. Most of them are located inside its supermarkets. The Kroger Pharmacies continue as a profitable portion of the business, and have been expanding to now include pharmacies in City Market, Dillons, Fred Meyer, Fry’s, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs, Smith’s Food and Drug, and Kroger Supermarkets. Supermarket Petroleum Group. Since 1998, Kroger has added fuel centers in the parking lots of its supermarkets, and as of the first quarter of 2010, Kroger operated 909 of them. In 2006, Kroger introduced a new common logo for all of its convenience store chains that is now also used at the fuel centers of all of its supermarket chains -- a rhombus with a white, stylized image of the continental United States in the center bordered by four colored areas: Dark blue representing the Pacific Ocean; red representing Canada; green representing the Atlantic Ocean; and yellow representing the Gulf of Mexico. Movie rentals. Most Kroger locations now feature Redbox movie rental kiosks. Previously, some Kroger locations featured kiosks from The New Release (aka Moviecube); most of these kiosks have since been replaced by Redbox kiosks. Also, until 2012, Kroger locations in the Columbus, Ohio area featured kiosks by Blockbuster Express (originally DVD Play). Distribution/Logistics. Kroger has a three-tiered distribution system. The 2nd and 3rd tiers, internally known as ""Peyton's,"" service retail stores and provide promotional and seasonal products. Kroger operates five ""Peyton's"" which include: Kroger operates its own fleet of trucks and trailers to distribute products to its various stores, in addition to contracts with trucking companies First Fleet and Quickway Distribution. Food distribution and buying takes place under various subsidiaries and divisions. These include: Financial Services. Kroger Personal Finance was introduced in 2007 to offer various stores' branded Visa; mortgages; home equity loans; pet, renter's and home insurance and identity theft protection. In 2011, Kroger dropped its contract with MasterCard, and now offers store cards through Visa. "
wikipedia-1388593," Shinn Asuka  Shinn has also been featured in the films and manga adaptations, reprising his role from the ""Gundam SEED Destiny"". He is also featured in various video games from the franchise as well as crossover titles. Shinn was developed as the opposite from Kira Yamato, the protagonist from the series' prequel ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED"" with director Mitsuo Fukuda stating that nevertheless both would go through similar developments. Shinn's character has been well received by anime fans, appearing in Anime Grand Prix polls and Sunrise polls, being ranked as one of the most popular anime characters. On the other hand, critical reception for Shinn has been mixed due to his antagonistic personality as well as his actions across the series' second half. Appearances. In ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny"". Shinn is introduced in the series as a member of the military organization ZAFT from the colony PLANT, working as the pilot of the mobile suit under the command of Talia Gladys, captain of the battleship Minerva. While Shinn is often seen as a friendly person, he bears an enormous hatred towards the rulers of the country of Orb, where he lived alongside his parents and his younger sister. Shinn's family was killed in a crossfire between mobile suits from the Earth Alliance and Orb during the Bloody Valentine war. When Athrun Zala becomes Shinn's commander, he is initially angered by his appointment, but eventually comes to respect him. Upon the start of a new war between ZAFT and the Earth Alliance, Shinn saves a girl named Stella Loussier from drowning. The two befriend each other, without realizing that they were actually fighting each other in the war. Shinn discovers she is an Earth Alliance's soldier only after he defeats her mobile suit in a battle. Because of Stella being an Extended, a person injected with drugs from a young age to fight at the same level of the Coordinators, the Minerva staff can not do anything to stop her health from deteriorating. Shinn takes the dying Stella to her superior Neo Roanoke knowing he is the only one who can save her. However, Shinn once again battles Stella who is attacking Berlin in an enormous transformable mobile suit. Stella had gone berserk due to her fear of dying and her mobile suit is then destroyed by Kira Yamato, a pilot from the Archangel ship that is trying to stop the war. Stella dies in Shinn's arms due to the injuries received from her suit's destruction.  Angered with Stella's death, Shinn starts training with his friend Rey Za Burrel to defeat Kira in an upcoming battle. Following his victory, PLANT Chairman Gilbert Durandal gives him the mobile suit to pilot as a reward for his actions. When Athrun is deemed to be a traitor by ZAFT, Shinn follows his superiors orders to kill him when he escapes with a mobile suit alongside Shinn's comrade Meyrin Hawke. While shocked about his actions, Shinn is comforted by Meyrin's older sister, Lunamaria Hawke, who he starts growing closer to as she feels Shinn is not to blame for her sister's apparent death. In following battles against the Earth Alliance, Shinn learns that both Kira and Athrun are alive, with the latter joining the former and is questioned about his motives to fight. Rey convinces Shinn to continue following Durandal's will and he defeats most of Earth Alliance's forces. When the Minerva is confronted by the Archangel again, Shinn is defeated by Athrun in battle with the all the other Minerva forces also being defeated. In other media. Shinn has also appeared in the original video animation ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Final Plus"", that remakes the events from series' last episode. After ZAFT's defeat, Shinn meets the Kira Yamato in person and both decide to join forces for a peaceful future. He also stars in the """" films series that retell the events from the ""Gundam SEED Destiny"" television series. He remains in ZAFT after the war's ending, alongside Kira and Lunamaria. He has also been featured in the two manga adaptations from the series, ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny"" and ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge"". ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge Desire"" deals with both Shinn's backstory and aftermath after the events of the Second Bloody Valentine War. Shinn also appears in the manga ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Astray"" when ZAFT presents the Impulse for the first time. There is also a character CD based on Shinn's character with tracks performed by his Japanese voice actor, Kenichi Suzumura. Shinn is a pilot in the video game ' and its sequel ' with his two mobile suits. He is also featured in the Gundam crossover games ' and ' with Destiny as a playable mobile suit. Shinn is playable in both ' and ""Gundam vs. Gundam Next"", with the Impulse and Destiny though the latter was not added until PlayStation Portable version of the first game. He is an unlockable in the third game, '. Shinn also appears in the ""Super Robot Wars"" series starting on ""Super Robot Wars Z"" and ""Super Robot Wars K"". Shinn is also playable with the Destiny mobile suit in """". Creation and conception. During initial episodes from ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny"", director Mitsuo Fukuda did not want to talk too much about Shinn's character. However, he defined him as Kira's opposite in regards to their personalities when comparing the two lead characters. Shinn is defined as a civilian whose character could already go through a large development in contrast to Kira who was forced to become a soldier in the prequel ""Mobile Suit Gundam SEED"". In comparison with Kira, Shinn was stated to be character harder to predict his role in the TV series. As with Kira in ""Gundam SEED"", Fukuda mentioned Shinn's character would also change across the series. Kenichi Suzumura was especially hired to work as Shinn's Japanese voice actor with Fukuda stating he was not a character difficult to play. Fukuda also anticipated Suzumura's work as Shinn's voice actor in an optimistic way. Before the series' premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn's character, telling that the ""Gundam SEED Destiny""s protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance. Reception. Shinn's character has become popular within fans, appearing various times in the Anime Grand Prix popularity polls for favorite male characters. He first appeared in sixth place in 2004, dropping to seventh place in 2005, and twelveth place in 2006. In a ""Newtype"" poll, Shinn was voted as the seventeenth most popular male anime character from the 2000s. In an official Gundam poll by Sunrise, Shinn was voted as the third character with the strongest family bonds. In another poll from the same site regarding who was most childish hero within the Gundam franchise, Shinn was at the top. In another poll in which fans were asked who was the most memorable characters from ""Gundam SEED Destiny"", Shinn was second. Publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Shinn's character, giving him mainly mixed critics. His introduction to the series was noted to lack impact by Paul Fargo from Anime News Network owing to his limited screentime in the first episodes. Additionally, his hostility shown towards other popular characters from ""Gundam SEED"" led Fargo to find him more as an ""antagonistic and obnoxious"" person much to the viewers. A similar response was made by Luis Cruz from Mania Entertainment who stated that Shinn's debut was overshadowed by Athrun Zala's role in the first episodes. Nevertheless, Cruz wanted to know his character would be developed to learn his motivations to fight. DVDTalk's Don Houston found his hatred for Orb because of his family's death being uncommon as he did not blame ""the attackers like most sane people would do"". His personality was also found remminscent to the one of Kira Yamato by Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network who also expected such two characters to engage in battle in following episodes. Maria Lin from Animefringe stated that Shinn's relative younger age from the ones of ""Gundam SEED""s returning characters was meant to emphasize the frustration to the beginning of another major conflict. Shinn's and Stella's relationship was praised by Cruz for the friendship mainly they made because both of them were unnaware they are enemies. However, although in following reviews from ""Gundam SEED Destiny"", Liversidge liked how Shinn's and Stella Loussier's relationship concluded ending in a tragic way due to their battles, he found Kira's role in the series to be more likable. Moreover, in the series finale, he wondered whether Shinn would do an action appreciated by the viewers, but ended favoriting the scene in which an angrered Athrun defeats him with a ""much deserved kicking"" as at the same time Shinn's attitude was teased. Shinn's role in the OVA ""Final Plus"" that remade the last episode was noted to have made his defeat more satisfying to the viewers, as well as giving a last chance for viewers to like him. "
wikipedia-1791250," Simpsons Bible Stories  ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" is the eighteenth episode of ""The Simpsons""' tenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on Easter, 1999. It is the first of ""The Simpsons"" now annual trilogy episodes, and consists of four self-contained segments. In the episode the Simpsons family fall asleep during a sermon in church. Marge dreams that she and Homer are Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Lisa dreams that she and her fellow Springfield Elementary School students are Hebrew slaves in Ancient Egypt and guides Moses to lead them to freedom. Homer dreams that he is King Solomon called to resolve a dispute between Lenny and Carl over the ownership of a pie, and Bart dreams he is King David, who has to fight Goliath's son, Goliath II. ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" was written by Matt Selman, Larry Doyle and Tim Long, and was the first episode Nancy Kruse directed for ""The Simpsons"". While executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully stated that the idea for the episode came after Fox requested an Easter-themed episode, co-writer Selman argued that it was conceived by former staff writers Dan Greaney and Donick Cary while they were pitching ideas for the tenth season. Because the episode mostly takes place outside Springfield, the animators had to design completely new sets. While the episode mostly features references to the Old Testament and Christianity, it also parodies children's television programs, American politicians and action films by Jerry Bruckheimer. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 12.2 million viewers, a drop from the previous episode which garnered 15.5 million viewers. Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics and won an Annie award in the category of Best Animated Television Production. In 2007, the episode was released as part of ""The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season"" DVD box set, and a promotional poster for the episode was included in an exhibition in Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The episode's ending scene is one of series creator Matt Groening's favorite moments on ""The Simpsons"". Plot. Hot Easter. It is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, and no one is interested in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons. When the collection plate is passed round, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny that he found in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, calling it a wicked idol, and provoking him to read the Bible from the beginning. The Simpsons all fall asleep. Marge's Dream. Marge dreams that she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the forbidden tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate the most, God only caught Eve eating the apples, and she is therefore banished from the Garden of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks of a way of getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden. Lisa's Dream. Lisa imagines she and all the other Springfield Elementary students are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if it is going to be smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many years, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna. Homer's Dream. Homer pictures himself as King Solomon. Lenny and Carl fight over ownership of a pie. King Solomon cuts it in half, sentences Lenny and Carl to death, and then eats the pie. King Solomon then presides over a civil case between Jesus Christ and Checker Chariot. Bart's Dream. Bart sees himself as King David, who kills Goliath, but has not won the war yet: Nelson is Goliath II, Goliath's son. Goliath II has killed Methuselah (Grampa), David's oldest friend. In retaliation, David challenges Goliath II, but having no stones to sling at him, David loses and is catapulted from the city. David then meets Ralph, a shepherd, who claims he can kill Goliath II. Ralph dies, which enrages David even more. He then trains to try to slay Goliath. Having to climb up the enormous Tower of Babel beforehand, David manages to kill Goliath by throwing a lit lantern down his throat. Goliath is surprisingly still alive, but is quickly killed by Ralph's gravestone, hurled by Ralph himself, who also had not died. Much to his shock, David is sent to jail as the townspeople claim that Goliath was the best King they ever had, building roads, libraries and hospitals. The dream ends with a title card that reads ""A Bart Simpson Dream"". Ending sequence. As the family wakes up, they find themselves alone in the church. Upon exiting they realize that the Apocalypse has come; fire rains from a red sky, and the Four Horsemen ride past. The Flanders ascend into Heaven, but The Simpsons do not; Lisa begins to ascend, but Homer grabs her ankle and pulls her back down. Instead, the Simpsons descend via a staircase into Hell, where Homer follows the delicious scent of barbecue. The episode ends with Homer screaming in agony (because there are no hot dogs, there is pineapple in the coleslaw, and German potato salad) as ""Highway To Hell"" by AC/DC plays over the credits. Production. ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" was co-written by Matt Selman, Larry Doyle and Tim Long, and was the first episode Nancy Kruse directed for ""The Simpsons"". It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 4, 1999, the day Easter took place that year. According to executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully, the idea for the episode was conceived when Fox requested an Easter-themed ""Simpsons"" episode that would air on the holiday. Normally, Fox would not broadcast any new ""Simpsons"" episodes on Easter, as it is considered a ""low-ratings night,"" but ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" was an exception. However, according to co-writer Selman, the idea for the episode came about when he and former staff writer Dan Greaney were pitching episode ideas for the tenth season with former staff writer Donick Cary. Cary and Greaney suggested a ""bible-trilogy"" story, which then became ""Simpsons Bible Stories"". ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" is the first of the trilogy episodes which, since the season 12 episode ""Simpsons Tall Tales"", ""The Simpsons"" produces once every season. The first segment was written by Long. According to former staff writer Tom Martin, Long wanted the pig in the garden of Eden to have a ""Tony British"" accent. The pig was voiced by regular cast member Hank Azaria, who portrays Moe Szyslak among other characters in the series. The unicorn that digs a hole from the garden of Eden was portrayed by Tress MacNeille. The second segment was written by Doyle. The episode's third segment was written by Selman. When writing segments for trilogy episodes, the writing staff usually follow the stories they are based on, while putting ""The Simpsons"" characters in the original characters' place. With ""Simpsons Bible Stories""' third segment, Selman stated that he wanted to go a ""fresh new way"" by instead writing a sequel to the story of David and Goliath. According to Scully, Selman had a very clear vision of how he wanted the segment to be, and Selman said that he wanted to make a ""dog's breakfast"" of movie clichés at the time. The song that plays during Bart's training montage is ""Winner Takes It All"" by American rock singer Sammy Hagar. Selman decided to include the song after hearing it in the 1987 action drama film ""Over the Top"". According to Doyle, the scene was originally much longer, almost seven minutes in length. The song that plays during the episode's end credits is ""Highway to Hell"" by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. According to Scully, the staff could not use the song on ""The Simpsons"" at first, since AC/DC's record company refused to sell it. However, when Scully called the band's manager directly, it turned out he had not been told about the request. Scully said that when they asked if they could use ""Highway to Hell"", the band's manager ""signed on right away"" and gave the ""Simpsons"" staff a ""huge discount."" Because most of the episode takes place in ancient history, the animators had to create completely new sets and designs for the episode. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Kruse stated that she and staff animator Alex Ruiz had to re-draw a majority of the episode, as the faulty scenes were drawn by six trainees. In order to receive an animator credit on ""The Simpsons"", an animator has to draw ten scenes in an episode. Because the trainees did not draw ten scenes each, none of them were credited for their work on the episode. All the trainees were later hired to ""The Simpsons"" animation staff. Kruse stated that, while animating the episode, she was worried that the animation department would be offended by the episode's content, as many of the crew members were ""very religious."" However, as animation ensued, she found that most of the animators were not uncomfortable with the episode, as it mostly parodies the Old Testament. The only complaint she received was from an animator who refused to animate Jesus in the court room scene in Homer's dream. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Scully stated that he regretted not submitting ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" for the Primetime Emmy Award in the category of animated programming less than one hour in 1999. At the time, Scully reasoned that, because the original stories were not conceived by the writing staff, the episode would not hold up. However, he noted that the episode's animation was ""outstanding,"" and that he later found out that the Emmy awards ""put a lot of importance on"" the animation in submitted episodes. Instead of submitting ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" for the Emmy awards in 1999, Scully submitted ""Viva Ned Flanders"", which ultimately lost to the ""King of the Hill"" episode ""And They Call It Bobby Love."" Cultural references. ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" contains several references to the Christian prophets, holy book and the religion as a whole, as well as films based on the Bible. Each segment is based on a biblical story, mostly from the Old Testament. The first segment is based on the story of Adam and Eve, who, according to the Book of Genesis were the first man and woman created by YHWH, the God of the Hebrew Bible. Ned Flanders has the role of God, while the serpent that lures Marge into eating an apple from the forbidden tree resembles Snake Jailbird. The Garden of Eden was the place where Adam and Eve lived after they were created by God, according to the Book of Genesis. The second segment parodies Moses who, according to the Book of Exodus, freed the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh. Milhouse has the role of Moses while Skinner has the role of the Pharaoh. When the Pharaoh asked who vandalized his sarcophagus, the burning bush tells him that Bart did it. When Bart is seized by the Pharaoh's guards, he exclaims ""No, the bush set me up!"" Bart's line refers to the 1990 arrest of Marion Barry who, while being arrested by the FBI for smoking crack cocaine, exclaimed ""No, the bitch set me up!"" In a scene in the segment, Milhouse and Lisa can be seen pouring frogs into Skinner's tent. The scene refers to the second of ten Biblical plagues that were imposed on Egypt by Yahweh, in chapters 7-12 of the Book of Exodus. While they are inside the torture chamber, Milhouse and Lisa walk past an orb. The orb is called ""Orb of Isis"" and played a big part in the season 9 episode ""Lost Our Lisa"". In another scene, Milhouse parts the Red Sea so that his fellow slaves can escape. The execution of the scene is based on the one seen in the 1956 American epic film ""The Ten Commandments"", in which Moses parts the Red Sea. The shot in which Pharaoh and his guards are drowning is also taken from the movie. In Homer's dream, Homer has the role of King Solomon who, according to the Books of Kings and Book of Chronicles was a King of Israel, as well as one of the 48 prophets according to the Talmud. Bart's dream shows Bart as King David and, rather than telling the story of David and Goliath, Bart's dream is a ""sequel"" to the story. The segment is inspired by and contains references to several films by Jerry Bruckheimer, including ""Die Hard"" and ""Lethal Weapon"", and borrows elements from other action films. At one point in the segment, Bart's dog Santa's Little Helper starts talking to him. The dog's voice is similar to that of Goliath in the Christian stop-motion animated television series ""Davey and Goliath"". Inside the whale skeleton in the episode, Bart finds the remains of Jonah. Jonah was a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel, according to the Hebrew Bible. Nelson lives in the Tower of Babel which, according to the Book of Genesis, was an enormous tower that the humans built in order to reach heaven. After being defeated by Bart, Nelson reappears while a variation of Modest Mussorgsky's composition ""St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain"" plays in the background. At the end of the segment, Bart is arrested and Chief Wiggum says ""Where's your messiah now?"" Wiggum's line was also taken from ""The Ten Commandments"", from a character played by Edward G. Robinson, on whom Wiggum's voice is based. Release and reception. In its original American broadcast on April 4, 1999, ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" received a 7.4 Nielsen rating, translating to approximately 7.4 million viewers. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 12.2 million viewers watched the episode, a considerable drop from the previous episode, which was seen by an estimated 15.5 million viewers. David Bianculli of ""New York Daily News"" attributed the loss in viewership to the fact that the episode aired on a religious holiday. Nevertheless, it was the week's second most watched program on the network. Later that year, the episode received an Annie award in the category of Best Animated Television Production, the second year in a row that ""The Simpsons"" won the award. On August 7, 2007, ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" was released as part of ""The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season"" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Tom Martin, Larry Doyle, Matt Selman and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode. Following its broadcast, ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" received mixed reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of ""I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide"" wrote that the episode is ""A fantastic twist of the Treehouse of Horror style of storytelling,"" and added that each segment is a ""classic on its own."" They wrote that Wiggum telling Moses and Lisa to give his regards to the British Museum as he seals them inside a tomb and Marge asking Bart if he is wearing clean underwear as they face the apocalypse were some of the episode's ""best moments,"" and concluded by writing that the episode is """"The Simpsons"" at its very best: inventive, irreverent and very, very funny."" While DVD Town's James Plath wrote that the episode's premise was ""risky,"" he still enjoyed the episode. Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of ""The Star-Ledger"" described the episode as ""hilarious,"" however they noted that the episode's ""suggestion that Moses parted the Red Sea by having all the Israelites flush their toilets at once"" could result in a backlash from the ""religious right."" On the other hand, giving the episode a negative review, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" ""proves less successful most Treehouse of Horror episodes."" He added that he ""just think the brevity required by the inclusion of three separate tales better suits the world of horror spoofs than it does these Bible pieces,"" as they ""try to pack an awful lot into very little time."" He concluded by writing that, while the episode has ""some good moments,"" he did not find a lot of entertainment in it. Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also critical, and wrote that the episode ""fails to be funny"" because it ""strays too far from the source material."" He added ""have you read the bible? That stuff’s funny enough in and of itself."" Aaron Roxby of Collider described ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" as his least-favourite trilogy episode, and wrote ""Considering that, in earlier seasons, the show had some of the most thoughtfully edgy religious humor on television, this one feels surprisingly toothless."" However, he gave praise to the talking pig in the Garden of Eden. At the end of the episode, the Simpsons walk out of the church and notice that the Apocalypse has begun. While the other family members are left on earth, Lisa at first starts ascending into Heaven, but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says ""Where do you think you're going, missy?"" The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer, and is series creator Matt Groening's favorite joke of the series. While the episode's ending is one of Groening's favourites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending ""drives them fans crazy,"" since they do not know whether or not the episode is canonical. In 2007, Homer's line ""Oh, I smell barbeque!"" was included in Bobby Bryant of ""The State""'s list ""20 Essential Things I've Learned From Homer Simpson"". The same year, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, unveiled a new exhibit which galleried Biblical images in art and pop culture, including a promotional poster for ""Simpsons Bible Stories.""

wikipedia-2550062," Logical Unit Number masking  Logical Unit Number Masking or LUN masking is an authorization process that makes a Logical Unit Number available to some hosts and unavailable to other hosts. LUN masking is mainly implemented at HBA level. The security benefits of LUN masking implemented at HBAs are limited, since with many HBAs it is possible to forge source addresses (WWNs/MACs/IPs) and compromise the access. Many storage controllers also support LUN masking. When LUN masking is implemented at the storage controller level, the controller itself enforces the access policies to the device and as a result it is more secure. However, it is mainly implemented not as a security measure per se, but rather as a protection against misbehaving servers which may corrupt disks belonging to other servers. For example, Windows servers attached to a SAN will, under some conditions, corrupt non-Windows (Unix, Linux, NetWare) volumes on the SAN by attempting to write Windows volume labels to them. By hiding the other LUNs from the Windows server, this can be prevented, since the Windows server does not even realize the other LUNs exist.  "
wikipedia-27652481," Alvin Greene  Alvin Michael Greene (born August 30, 1977) is a Democrat from South Carolina. He was the Democratic Party's nominee in the 2010 United States Senate election in South Carolina. He was defeated by incumbent Republican Sen. Jim DeMint by a margin of 61.46% to 27.65%, with most of the remaining votes going to Green Party candidate and environmental activist Tom Clements. He was the first African-American to be nominated for U.S. Senate by a major party in South Carolina. In the general election, Greene faced DeMint, Green Party candidate Tom Clements and write-in candidates Nathalie Dupree and Mazie Ferguson. Greene won the Democratic primary race against candidate Vic Rawl on June 8, 2010, with 59% of the vote, despite very limited campaigning and campaign spending, and having no website and no yard signs. The executive committee of the South Carolina Democratic Party voted 55 to 10 to reject Rawl's request for a new Senate primary after questions were raised about Greene's surprise victory. Greene graduated from the University of South Carolina in 2000 with a degree in political science. He is a United States military veteran who served in the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force before receiving an involuntary honorable discharge in 2009. At the time of his Senate campaign, Greene was unemployed and living with and caring for his father in Manning. On August 13, 2010, it was announced that he had been indicted on criminal charges of showing pornographic pictures to an 18-year old female college student. Greene was reportedly considering a run for President of the United States in 2012, but later declined. On December 24, 2010, Greene filed as a candidate in the Democratic primary special election for the South Carolina House of Representatives seat left vacant by the death of Representative Cathy Harvin. The primary was held on February 15, 2011; Greene received 36 votes. Background. Greene was born in Florence, South Carolina. His father, James Greene, Sr., is a retired teacher from the Clemson Extension program and was a barber and a nightclub owner. He was a prominent member of the community ""who wanted blacks to play a bigger role in politics and entertainment"" and ""an outspoken activist for Democratic politics."" Greene graduated from Manning High School in 1995 and received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of South Carolina in 2000. In multiple interviews, he's mentioned that throughout his late high school and early college years, his greatest inspiration was soul singer Neil Diamond. He served as an intelligence specialist and a unit supply specialist in the U.S. Army and has also served in the U.S. Air Force and the Army National Guard. He received the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the Korea Defense Service Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal. During Greene's time in the Air Force he received numerous poor evaluations from his superiors. The evaluations stated Greene was an ineffective leader who lacked organization and was unable to express thoughts clearly. Greene received an honorable but involuntary discharge from the Army in 2009 after a 13-year career and has been unemployed since. Senate campaign. Greene said that he originally got the idea to run for office in 2008 when he was stationed in Korea. In the South Carolina Democratic primary held June 8, 2010, he received 100,362 (59%) votes out of 170,215 votes cast, while 69,853 (41%) went to Vic Rawl. Voter turnout in most counties was in the range of 20-30%. After Greene was declared the winner and Rawl congratulated him on his win, several state and national Democratic officials began to voice opposition and to raise questions about Greene and his campaign. South Carolina Democratic Party chairwoman Carol Fowler said she had not seen Greene since he filed to run. Clarendon County Democratic Party Chairman Cal Land told local newspaper ""The Item"" that local party leaders had not met Greene, that he had not attended any local Democratic events and had not responded to any invitations to local stump meetings. He did not attend the state Democratic party convention, did not file legally required forms with the Secretary of the Senate or Federal Election Commission, and attempted to pay his $10,400 filing fee with a personal check, rather than a check from a campaign account. Greene was the first African-American to be nominated for the U.S. Senate by a major party in South Carolina. He was one of three black Democratic Senate candidates from Southern states in the 2010 elections; Greene, U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek of Florida and Georgia Commissioner of Labor Mike Thurmond were all unsuccessful in their races. Six African-Americans had served in the U.S. Senate, but none from the South since Reconstruction. Post-primary. Criminal charges. The day after the primary election, the media reported that Greene was facing felony obscenity charges stemming from a November 2009 arrest for allegedly showing a pornographic picture on an Internet site to an 18-year-old female University of South Carolina student in a computer lab, and then allegedly saying to her ""Let's go to your room."" She then called campus police. The mother of the victim has claimed that USC authorities had warned Greene not to visit certain parts of campus in the past. Greene has since said that he was joking when he spoke to the student, and that he feels she owes him an apology for pressing charges against him. As a result of these charges, Fowler issued a statement calling for Greene to drop out of the race. Greene refused to bow out of the race and announced that: ""The Democratic Party has chosen their nominee, and we have to stand behind their choice. The people have spoken. We need to be pro-South Carolina, not anti-Greene."" The executive committee of the South Carolina Democratic Party voted 5 to 1 to reject a call for a new Senate primary after Alvin's surprise victory. Greene appeared on various news programs after his primary victory. He responded with short answers, refused to comment on the obscenity allegations, and rejected allegations that he is employed by the Republican Party. On August 12, 2010, a Richland County grand jury indicted Greene for disseminating, procuring or promoting obscenity — a felony — as well as a misdemeanor charge of communicating obscene materials to a person without consent. The incident took place November 4, 2009, at the Bates House residence hall on the University of South Carolina's campus. A female student, Camille McCoy, reported that a man later identified as Greene, sat down beside her in the computer lab. He asked her for her name, room number, and phone number, but she did not give it to him. She told officers that five minutes later, he told her to look at his computer screen which contained pornographic images on it. McCoy told him that it was ""offensive and not funny"". The incident report states that Greene proceeded to ask if he could come to her room, and she told him to leave her alone. McCoy described the event: ""It was kind of scary. He's a pretty big boy. He could've overpowered me."" She then went up to her room and told her resident mentor about the incident. McCoy also reported the incident to the campus police and her parents who demanded that the police press charges. A warrant for Alvin Greene's arrest was issued on November 9, 2009 and he was subsequently arrested. In an affidavit against Greene, police say they have surveillance video which shows the interaction. When campus police arrived, they spoke to residence staff, who said Greene had been entering the Bates House for some time using an old university ID card with his picture on it. The staff had been told not to allow him inside the building anymore, but the person working that day had not been made aware of this information, and let Greene in as he normally did. The first charge, of disseminating, procuring or promoting obscenity, is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a maximum fine of $10,000. The second charge, communicating an obscene message to another person without consent, is a misdemeanor and carries a maximum of three years and a maximum fine of $10,000. On June 6, 2011, Greene accepted the Richland County prosecutor's offer to enter a pretrial diversion program which would expunge his record of both charges after completing a year-long course of counseling and community service. Media coverage of campaign. A study by the Pew Research Center released in late July found that Greene's campaign had received the most media attention of all of the 2010 political campaigns. Greene hired South Carolina attorney Suzanne Coe as his campaign manager. Coe said she offered to assist Greene after being struck by his honesty and selfless motivation. She said that ""If Alvin tells you he's hiking the Appalachian Trail, he really would be hiking the Appalachian Trail. You can believe what he says."" (In 2009, then-South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford had claimed to be hiking the Appalachian Trail to cover up an extramarital affair.) A Rasmussen Reports survey released in early August of 500 likely South Carolina voters found that 20% of them backed Greene while 62% supported DeMint. As well, 51% of those polled said that they had a very unfavorable opinion of Greene. Although Greene repeatedly expressed interest in a debate, DeMint declined to participate. The progressive watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Greene to their list of the 11 most crooked candidates vying for federal office in 2010. Greene took exception to this designation, saying that ""I think my opponent should be on this list. He’s not doing his job and he doesn’t care about South Carolina or the United States of America."" Election results. On election day, Greene lost to DeMint by a margin of 63% to 28%, with Green Party candidate Tom Clements receiving 9% of the vote. Potential 2012 presidential campaign. Greene reportedly asked the South Carolina Democratic Party how much the filing fee would be to run for President of the United States, after he lost the 2010 midterm election to Jim DeMint. He told ""The Daily Caller"" on November 9 that ""We will have a Greene/Obama showdown in 2012."" The next day, he confirmed to the ""Columbia Free Times"" that he was ""seriously considering"" a presidential campaign, although he was not sure for which party he would run. Greene justified his potential bid by saying ""I’m the man. I’m the man. I’m the man. Greene’s the man. I’m the man. I’m the greatest person ever. I was born to be president. I’m the man, I’m the greatest individual ever.” A year later, Greene notified ""The Daily Caller"" that he would not seek the presidency. Political positions. Economy. During his campaign, Greene described himself as a moderate Democrat. His campaign slogan was ""Let's get South Carolina back to work."" Greene favored measures to lower the price of gas and supports offshore drilling. He supported a united Korea under a democratic system of government. He supported allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire and supported reform of the financial industry. Greene supported job creation, increased highway construction projects and pursuit of alternative energy sources. He also called for better school facilities and pay raises for teachers. On the subject of firearms, Greene said he supported the Constitution. Greene favored winding down the wars in the Middle East and ""using that money for domestic programs, such as job creation, education, and Social Security."" In his first speech after winning the nomination, Greene proposed to spend more money on education, building highways and tourism infrastructure. He proposed to build new evacuation routes from the coast. He also wanted to expand water and sewer systems into rural communities, use renewable energy where it is possible.  Greene stated that the government should break up large banks, shut down payday lenders, and reform the debt collection industry. He also pledged to work to end free trade by enacting tariffs or banning the importation of foreign goods to the United States. Judicial reform. Greene strongly promoted idea of the reforms in judicial system to make sure that punishment fits the crime. Greene supported the idea that the severity of penalty for a misdeed or wrongdoing should be reasonable and proportionate to the severity of the infraction. He said that first-time non-violent offenders should have a chance to go into pre-trial intervention programs, instead of going to jail. “Fairness saves us money,” he said in an interview. “There are innocent people incarcerated. We spend more than two times of our taxpayer dollars on inmates than on students.” Health care. In an editorial published in ""The Guardian"" as ""The Alvin Greene manifesto for a fairer America"", Greene explained his political views in more detail and attacked the political establishment. Greene advocated free universal health care, saying that the United States should model its system on Austria, Britain, or Canada. Education. Greene also stated that the United States should adopt a free college education policy modeled after the system that had been in place in Britain. Government reform. Greene cited the example of mismanagement at the Pentagon as proof that greater accountability in government is needed. He criticized corporate influence on politics, saying that ""Half the members of the US senate work for BP. The other half work for Halliburton."" Questions about candidacy. Though his primary victory baffled many, several explanations have been offered. Some observers, including State Representative Bakari Sellers, have stated that the fact that his name appeared above Vic Rawl may have caused voters who were unfamiliar with either candidate to vote for Greene. South Carolina State Senator Robert Ford claimed that the surname ""Greene"" is common among African-Americans, and suggested that fact may have caused African-American voters to identify with him. Rawl has said there were problems with the voting machines. Some speculated that Greene might have been a Republican plant. South Carolina Democratic Party officials noted that the practice of running select candidates to pressure candidates and influence election outcomes has occurred in the past, in both Democratic and Republican primaries. Nu Wexler, the former executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party, commented ""You have consultants doing this kind of thing just because they get bored, and they want something to tell good stories about. It's almost like fraternity pranks."" House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, the first African-American elected to either the House or the Senate from South Carolina since Reconstruction, said that he suspected that Greene was a plant, and although there was no evidence of any wrongdoing, Clyburn called for an investigation into the primary. Clyburn also alleged that two other African-American candidates, Gregory Brown and Ben Frasier, were plants. Brown campaigned against Clyburn for the 6th Congressional District seat, and Frasier beat state Democratic Party-backed candidate Robert Burton for the nomination in the 1st congressional district. Clyburn said he ""just felt this was 1990 all over again"", referring to the events in the 1990 primary in South Carolina when political consultant Rod Shealy recruited an unemployed black fisherman to run in a Republican congressional primary in order to boost white turnout for a different election on the same ballot. Some commentators raised questions about the source of Greene's funding for the $10,440 filing fee. Federal and state law requires a candidate to pay a filing fee out of his own pocket. Greene claimed that he paid the filing fee by saving two years of his service pay. However, Greene qualified to be represented by a public defender in his obscenity case. South Carolina law requires defendants who want to be represented by the public defender's office to file an ""affidavit of indigency"" in order to prove they cannot afford to hire a lawyer. On this affidavit, the applicant must disclose all income and assets, including checking accounts. Former state Democratic Party chairman Dick Harpootlian told NPR that this revelation raises doubts about whether Greene could afford the filing fee. Harpootlian also said that this gave W. Barney Giese, the solicitor (district attorney) for the 5th Judicial Circuit, which includes Columbia, to ask a judge to make Greene explain how he could pay the filing fee if he needs a public defender. Clyburn also doubts that Greene could have paid the filing fee on his own. Late on the afternoon of June 11, Fowler told WCNC-TV in Charlotte that the Federal Election Commission had launched a probe into where Greene got the money for the fee. In response to an official protest filed by Rawl, the executive committee of the South Carolina Democratic Party conducted a formal hearing on June 17, 2010, to review questions regarding the legitimacy of the primary election results. Greene neither attended nor sent a representative to the hearing. The executive committee found insufficient evidence of impropriety, and voted to uphold the June 8 election results. On June 27, 2010, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the 5th Circuit Solicitor's office announced that they were investigating Greene's finances. On the same day, it emerged that Greene's public defender had been replaced by a private attorney. On July 9, 2010, Greene was cleared of wrongdoing after a state criminal probe determined Greene had indeed paid the filing fee from his own personal funds. Media coverage. Greene has been called an enigmatic figure in American politics. Much attention has been devoted to his manner of speaking due to his habits of frequently interrupting himself, halting mid-sentence, and saying ""OK"" between statements. He was frequently satirized in the media for this reason. At times, his jokes were not well understood by the media, such as when he told British newspaper ""The Guardian"" that one way to create jobs is to employ people to make ""toys of me"", or Alvin Greene toys. Greene later addressed this statement, saying that it was a joke geared for a British audience. The Charleston RiverDogs baseball team later held a promotion in which they gave away figurines with Greene's photo on them. Greene decried the promotion, describing it as tacky and pointing out that the statues did not look like him. Greene is the subject of a new feature-length documentary film entitled ""Who is Alvin Greene?"" to be directed by David Garrett and Leslie Beaumont. Viral video. In late July 2010, a hip hop-based viral video titled ""Alvin Greene is on the scene"" became a hit on YouTube and other internet sites, garnering thousands of views an hour. It promoted Greene's candidacy and intermixed media clips of him with clips of LeBron James. As well, AutoTune was used to manipulate some of the lyrics. The video credits Greene as producer, director, editor, and ""second camera"", his father as the ""first camera"", and the music is credited to 'MC Grassroots feat, The Real Americans, mixxed by Defeat Demint Posse' (a reference to Republican opponent Jim DeMint). Jay Friedman, a San Francisco-based music producer, has come forward as the song's creator. ""New York Times"" journalist Katherine Q. Seelye stated that the chorus ""may be ringing in your ears for days after tuning in"". NBC News journalist Ali Weinberg stated that the video combined ""some of today's most overplayed elements of pop culture"". CBS journalist Jaywon Choe labeled it ""catchy"" with ""several noteworthy rhymes"". CNN journalist Peter Hamby called it ""catchy"", ""clever"", and ""the political jam of the summer"" while also praising its ""throwback hip-hop beat"". Greene has since denied that he played any role in the production of the video, although he told Hamby that ""It sounds good."" He also said he hopes that ""everybody hears it."" Freidman has described the video as ""jokey"" and said that ""eople are willing to believe very strange things when they come from the internet."" Greene also said that if he heard the song in a club, he'd dance to it. At one point, YouTube administrators had removed the video due to a copyright claim by Frank Strategies, LLC. The video featured footage from a Tea Party rally in 2009 that is owned by Frank Strategies, LLC. "
wikipedia-543837," Avro Anson  The Avro Anson is a British twin-engine, multi-role aircraft that served with the Royal Air Force, Fleet Air Arm, Royal Canadian Air Force and numerous other air forces before, during, and after the Second World War. Named after British Admiral George Anson, it was originally designed as an airliner as the Avro 652 before being redeveloped for maritime reconnaissance, but was soon rendered obsolete in both roles. However, it was rescued from obscurity by its suitability as a multi-engine air crew trainer, becoming the mainstay of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. By the end of production in 1952, the Anson spanned nine variants; a total of 8,138 were built in Britain by Avro. From 1941, a further 2,882 were built by Federal Aircraft Ltd. in Canada. Design and development. The Anson was derived from the commercial six-seat 652 model; the militarised version, which first flew on 24 March 1935, was built to Air Ministry Specification 18/35. It was the first RAF monoplane with a retractable undercarriage. Avro allotted the type number 652A to the Anson. The first production run resulted in 174 Mk I aircraft for service with Coastal Command. No. 48 Squadron RAF was the first to be equipped in March 1936.  A distinctive feature of the Anson I was its landing gear retraction mechanism which required no less than 140 turns of the hand crank by the pilot. To forgo this laborious process, early model aircraft often made short flights with the landing gear extended at the expense of 30 mph (50 km/h) of cruise speed. A total of 11,020 Ansons were built by the end of production in 1952, making it the second-most-numerous (after the Vickers Wellington), British multi-engine aircraft of the war. Operational history. At the start of the Second World War, there were 26 RAF squadrons operating the Anson I: 10 with Coastal Command and 16 with Bomber Command. However, by this time, it was obsolete in the roles of bombing and coastal patrol and was being superseded by the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and Lockheed Hudson.  Limited numbers of Ansons continued to serve in operational roles such as coastal patrols and air/sea rescue. Early in the war, an Anson scored a probable hit on a German U-boat. In June 1940, a flight of three Ansons was attacked by nine Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Remarkably, before the dogfight ended, the Ansons destroyed two German aircraft and damaged a third without losing any of their own.The aircraft's true role, however, was to train pilots for flying multi-engine bombers such as the Avro Lancaster. The Anson was also used to train the other members of a bomber's air crew, such as navigators, wireless operators, bomb aimers and air gunners. Postwar, the Anson continued in the training and light transport roles. The last Ansons were withdrawn from RAF service with communications units on 28 June 1968.  The Royal Australian Air Force operated 1,028 Ansons, mainly Mk Is, until 1955. The Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Navy operated the aircraft until 1952. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), employed 50 Canadian-built Ansons, designated the AT-20.  The Royal New Zealand Air Force operated 23 Ansons as navigation trainers in the Second World War, (alongside the more numerous Airspeed Oxford), and acquired more Ansons as communication aircraft immediately after the war. A preserved navigation trainer is in the Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum at Wigram. The Egyptian Air Force operated Ansons in communications and VIP duties. A specially outfitted Anson was gifted to the then King by the Royal Air Force. The Royal Afghan Air Force obtained 13 Anson 18 aircraft for various duties from 1948. These aircraft survived until 1972. Postwar civil use. After the war, Ansons continued in production with Avro at Woodford for civilian use as light transports with small charter airlines and as executive aircraft for industrial companies. Countries which saw civilian operations with Ansons included Great Britain, Canada, Australia and Denmark.  Railway Air Services operated Ansons on scheduled services from London's Croydon Airport via Manchester to Belfast (Nutts Corner) in 1946 and 1947. Sivewright Airways operated three Mk XIX aircraft from their Manchester Airport base on charter flights as far as Johannesburg and on scheduled flights to Ronaldsway Airport in the Isle of Man until 1951. Finglands Airways operated an ex-RAF Anson I on inclusive tour flights and on scheduled flights from Manchester Airport to Newquay Airport between 1949 and 1952. Kemps Aerial Surveys operated several Anson XIXs on survey work within the UK until their retirement in 1973. India ordered 12 new Anson 18Cs in 1948 for use by the Directorate of Civil Aviation as trainers and communications aircraft, these were delivered from Woodford in the spring of 1949. Ansons continued to be built by Avro at Woodford for the RAF until March 1952 and were used as trainers and served in the role of Station communications aircraft until 1968. The wooden wings of Ansons flying in Australia were found to fail at a high rate. The phenolic glue bonds parted, and it was speculated that the problem was due to the high humidity. The Commonwealth Government grounded most wooden-winged aircraft types in 1962, in particular, Ansons and Mosquitos. No aircraft were re-registered as the government mandated a test that essentially destroyed the wings, requiring new wings to be fitted. Most owners had voluntarily scrapped their aircraft well before this time. Although Ansons have mainly been retired from flying, a 1936 Avro Anson Mk.I was recently made airworthy, fitted with later metal wings and returned to the air on 18 July 2012 in Nelson, New Zealand. Variants. The main Anson variant was the Mk I, of which 6,704 were built in Britain. The other variants were mainly distinguished by their powerplant with Canadian-built Ansons using local engines. To overcome steel shortages, the 1,051 Canadian-built Mk V Ansons featured a plywood fuselage. "

wikipedia-1180592," Lectures on the Philosophy of History  Lectures on the Philosophy of History, also translated as ""Lectures on the Philosophy of World History"" (German: ""Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte""), is a major work by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), originally given as lectures at the University of Berlin in 1821, 1824, 1827, and 1831. It presents world history in terms of the Hegelian philosophy in order to show that history follows the dictates of reason and that the natural progress of history is due to the outworking of absolute spirit.  The text was originally published in 1837 by the editor Eduard Gans, six years after Hegel's death, utilizing Hegel's own lecture notes as well as those found that were written by his students. A second German edition was compiled by Hegel's son, Karl, in 1840. A third German edition, edited by Georg Lasson, was published in 1917. Themes. Written History. Hegel begins by distinguishing three methods or modes of doing history: Original History, Reflective History and Philosophical History. Original history is like that of Herodotus and Thucydides, these are almost contemporaneous writings limited to deeds, events and states of society which they had before their very eyes and whose culture they shared. Reflective history is written at some temporal distance from the events or history considered. However, for Hegel, this form of history has a tendency to impose the cultural prejudices and ideas of the historians' era upon the past history over which the historian reflects. Philosophical history for Hegel, is the true way. Hegel maintains that with philosophical history the historian must bracket his own preconceptions and go and find the overall sense and the driving ideas out of the very matter of the history considered. Spirit. Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of world history are often used to introduce students to Hegel's philosophy, in part because Hegel's sometimes difficult style is muted in the lectures, and he discourses on accessible themes such as world events in order to explain his philosophy. Much of the work is spent defining and characterizing Geist or spirit. The Geist is similar to the culture of people, and is constantly reworking itself to keep up with the changes of society, while at the same time working to produce those changes through what Hegel called the ""cunning of reason"" (""List der Vernunft""). Another important theme of the text is the focus on world history, rather than regional or state history. Thinkers such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) had written on the concept and importance of world history and nationalism, and Hegel's philosophy continues this trend, while breaking away from an emphasis on nationalism and striving rather to grasp the full sweep of human cultural and intellectual history as a manifestation of spirit. Theodicy. Hegel explicitly presents his lectures on the philosophy of history as a theodicy, or a reconciliation of divine providence with the evils of history. This leads Hegel to consider the events of history in terms of universal reason: ""That world history is governed by an ultimate design, that it is a rational process... this is a proposition whose truth we must assume; its proof lies in the study of world history itself, which is the image and enactment of reason."" The ultimate design of the world is such that absolute spirit, here understood as God, comes to know itself and fully become itself in and through the triumphs and tragedies of history. Hegel is clear that history does not produce happiness - ""history is not the soil in which happiness grows. The periods of happiness in it are the blank pages of history""; ""History as the slaughter-bench"" (""Geschichte Als Schlachtbank"") - and yet the aims of reason are accomplished. Hegel writes: ""we must first of all know what the ultimate design of the world really is, and secondly, we must see that this design has been realized and that evil has not been able to maintain a position of equality beside it."" To see the reason in history is to be able to account for the evil within it. He argued against the 'professional historians' of the day such as Von Ranke. Hegel points out that the understanding and consequently writing of history always relies on a framework, be it religious, secular, 'postmodern' - that word is the very definition of ambiguity. Hegel chose to openly admit and explain his framework rather than hide it as many historians choose to do. History. According to Hegel, ""World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own freedom and of the consequent realization of this freedom."". This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them. Hegel's account of history begins with ancient cultures as he understood them. His account of the civilizations relied upon 19th century European scholarship, and contains an unavoidable Eurocentric bias. At the same time, the developmental nature of Hegel's philosophy meant that rather than simply deprecating ancient civilizations and non-European cultures, he saw them as necessary (if incomplete or underdeveloped) steps in the outworking of absolute spirit. Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of history contain one of his most well-known and controversial claims about the notion of freedom: World history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself. The Orientals do not know that the spirit or man as such are free in themselves. And because they do not know that, they are not themselves free. They only know that One is free... The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the Greeks, and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that Some, and not all men as such, are free... The Germanic nations, with the rise of Christianity, were the first to realize that All men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence. In other words, Hegel maintains that the consciousness of freedom in history moves from despotism, to a sense that freedom is a privilege of a few, to a robust notion that humanity is free in and of itself. Hegel believes that the spirit of human freedom is best nurtured within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch embodies the spirit and desires of the governed, and his reading of history locates the rise of such forms of government in the Germanic nations of, for example, the United Kingdom and Prussia after the Protestant Reformation. Hegel's ""one, some, and all"" proposition follows the basic geographical metaphor Hegel takes throughout his philosophy of history, namely, ""World history travels from east to west; for Europe is the absolute end of history, just as Asia is the beginning."" When referring to the east, Hegel generally has in mind the historical cultures of Persia, though at times he does reference China and spends a great deal of space discussing India and Indian religions.  However he also said that the view of history (including his own) should be open to change based on the 'empirical facts' available. The Text. German Editions. Because of the nature of the text (collections of edited lecture notes), critical editions were slow in forthcoming. The standard German edition for many years was the manuscript of Hegel's son Karl Hegel, published in 1840. The German edition produced by Eva Moldenhauer and Karl Michel (1986) essentially follows Karl Hegel's edition. The only critical edition in German of the text of the lectures is Georg Lasson's 4 vol. edition (1917–1920). This edition was published repeatedly (last in two volumes in 1980) by Felix Meiner Verlag, Hamburg. The long introduction was re-edited on the basis of Lasson's publication in 1955, by Johannes Hoffmeister. English Editions. No full English translation of the complete lectures has ever been produced. The first English translation was made from Karl Hegel's edition, which lacked much material discovered later. This translation, made by John Sibree (1857), is still the only English version which contains not only the Introduction, but the shorter body of the lectures according to Karl Hegel's 1840 manuscript. Though it is incomplete, this translation is often used by English speaking scholars and is prevalent in university classrooms in the English-speaking world. An English translation of the Introduction to the lectures was produced by Robert S. Hartman (1953) which included an introduction and additional editorial footnotes. Hartman produced this translation before Hoffmeister's critical edition was published, and it is quite short, only 95 pages. An English translation of Hoffmeister's critical edition of the Introduction was produced in 1974 by H. B. Nisbet. This edition presents the full text of the Introduction to Karl Hegel manuscript, as well as all later additions included in the Hoffmeister edition of the Introduction. As such, it is the only critical edition of any portion of the lectures available in English. No translation of the full edition of the lectures following Lasson has yet been produced. "
wikipedia-2348117," Meidum  Located about 100 km south of modern Cairo, Meidum or Maidum () is the location of a large pyramid, and several large mud-brick mastabas. Pyramid. The pyramid at Meidum is thought to have been originally built for Huni, the last pharaoh of the Third Dynasty and was continued by Sneferu. The architect was a successor to the famous Imhotep, the inventor of the stone built pyramid. He modified Imhotep's pyramid design in a way, which is likely to have caused the collapse of the pyramid in conjunction with the decision to extend the construction plan two times in a row, while the pyramid was already under construction. Because of its unusual appearance, the pyramid is called ""el-haram el-kaddab"" — (""Fake Pyramid"") in Egyptian Arabic. The second extension turned the original step pyramid design into a true pyramid by filling in the steps with limestone encasing. While this approach is consistent with the design of the other true pyramids, a couple of fatal errors were made at Meidum. Firstly, the outer layer was founded on sand and not on rock, like the inner layers. Secondly, the inner step pyramids had been designed as the final stage. Thus the outer surface was polished and the platforms of the steps were not horizontal, but fell off to the outside. This severely compromised the stability and is likely to have caused the collapse of the Meidum Pyramid in a downpour while the building was still under construction. Some believe the pyramid to have collapsed not until the New Kingdom, but there are a couple of facts contradicting this theory. The Meidum Pyramid seems never to have been completed. Beginning with Sneferu and to the 12th dynasty all pyramids had a valley temple, which is missing at Meidum. The mortuary temple, which was found under the rubble at the base of the pyramid, apparently never was finished. Walls were only partly polished. Two Steles inside, usually bearing the names of the pharaoh, are missing inscriptions. The burial chamber inside the pyramid itself is uncompleted, with raw walls and wooden supports still in place which are usually removed after construction. Affiliated mastabas were never used or completed and none of the usual burials have been found. Finally, the first examinations of the Meidum Pyramid found everything below the surface of the rubble mound fully intact. Stones from the outer cover were stolen only after they were exposed by the excavations. This makes a catastophic collapse more probable than a gradual one. The collapse of this pyramid during the reign of Sneferu is the likely reason for the change from the usual 52 to 43 degrees of his second pyramid at Dahshur, the Bent Pyramid. By the time it was investigated by Napoleon's Expedition in 1799 the Meidum Pyramid had its present 3 steps. It is commonly assumed the pyramid still had 5 steps in the fifteenth century and was gradually falling further into ruin, because al-Maqrizi described it as looking like a five-stepped mountain. But Mendelssohn claimed this might be the result of a loose translation and al-Makrizi's words would more accurately translate into ""five-storied mountain"". A description which could even match the present state of the pyramid with four bands of different masonry at the base and a step on top. Excavations. The Meidum Pyramid was excavated by John Shae Perring in 1837, Lepsius in 1843 and then by Flinders Petrie later in the nineteenth century, who located the mortuary temple, facing to the east. In 1920 Ludwig Borchardt studied the area further, followed by Alan Rowe in 1928 and then Ali el-Kholi in the 1970s. In its ruined state, the structure is 65 m high, and its entrance is aligned north-south, with the entrance in the north, 20 metres above present ground level. The steep descending passage 57 metres long leads to a horizontal passage, just below the original ground level, that then leads to a vertical shaft 10 metres high that leads to the corbelled burial chamber itself. The chamber is unlikely to have been used for any burial. Flinders Petrie was the first Egyptologist to establish the facts of its original design dimensions and proportions. In its final form it was 1100 Cubits of 0.523 m around by 175 Cubits high, thus showing the same proportions as the Great Pyramid at Giza, and therefore the same circular symbolism. Petrie wrote in the 1892 excavation report that ""We see then that there is an exactly analogous theory for the dimensions of Medum to that of the Great Pyramid ; in each the approximate ratio of 7 : 44 is adopted, as referred to the radius and circle.."". These proportions equated to the four outer faces sloping in by precisely 51.842° or 51° 50' 35"", which would have been understood and expressed by the Ancient Egyptians as a seked slope of 5½ palms  Mastabas. Located nearby is a mastaba of an unknown noble, the burial chamber of which can be entered via a robber's tunnel. This tunnel is steep, extremely narrow and confined. Once traversed however, the chamber and hallway are relatively spacious, and contain the first example of a red granite sarcophagus known in antiquity. Another mastaba is the Mastaba of Nefermaat. The stone sarcophagus remains within the unmarked and undecorated granite built chamber. The tunnel goes further on into the darkness, and as of 2002 remains unexplored. "
wikipedia-642276," Châteaux of the Loire Valley  The Châteaux of the Loire Valley are part of the architectural heritage of the historic towns of Amboise, Angers, Blois, Chinon, Nantes, Orléans, Saumur, and Tours along the Loire River in France. They illustrate the ideals of the Renaissance and the Age of the Enlightenment on French thought and design in the Loire Valley. History. By the middle of the 16th century, King Francois I had shifted the center of power in France from the Loire back to the ancient capital of Paris. With him went the great architects, but the Loire Valley continued to be the place where most of the French royalty preferred to spend the bulk of their time. The ascension to the throne of King Louis XIV in the middle of the 17th century made Paris the permanent site for great royal châteaux when he built the Palace of Versailles. Nonetheless, those who gained the king's favour and the wealthy bourgeoisie continued to renovate existing châteaux or build lavish new ones as their summer residence in the Loire. The French Revolution saw a number of the great French châteaux destroyed and many ransacked, their treasures stolen. The overnight impoverishment of many of the deposed nobility, usually after one of its members lost their head to the guillotine, saw many châteaux demolished. During World War I and World War II, some chateaux were commandeered as military headquarters. Some of these continued to be used this way after the end of WWII. Today, these privately owned châteaux serve as homes, a few open their doors to tourist visits, while others are operated as hotels or bed and breakfasts. Many have been taken over by a local government authority or the giant structures like those at Chambord are owned and operated by the national government and are major tourist sites, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. List. There is no universally accepted definition for inclusion in ""proper society"" as a ""Château of the Loire"". The main criterion for inclusion is generally that the château must be sited on the Loire river or one of its tributaries (such as the Maine, Cher, Indre, Creuse or Loir). Châteaux further upstream than Gien are generally not included, with the possible exception of the Bastie d'Urfé for its historical significance.

wikipedia-1788567," Sound art  Sound art is a diverse group of art practices that considers wide notions of sound, listening and hearing as its predominant focus. There are often distinct relationships forged between the visual and aural domains of art and perception by sound artists. Like many genres of contemporary art, sound art is interdisciplinary in nature, or takes on hybrid forms. Sound art often engages with the subjects of acoustics, psychoacoustics, electronics, noise music, audio media and technology (both analog and digital), found or environmental sound, explorations of the human body, sculpture, film or video and an ever-expanding set of subjects that are part of the current discourse of contemporary art. From the Western art historical tradition early examples include Luigi Russolo's ""Intonarumori"" or noise intoners, and subsequent experiments by Dadaists, Surrealists, the Situationist International, and in Fluxus happenings. Because of the diversity of sound art, there is often debate about whether sound art falls within the domain of either the visual art or experimental music categories, or both. Other artistic lineages from which sound art emerges are conceptual art, minimalism, site-specific art, sound poetry, spoken word, avant-garde poetry, and experimental theatre.  Scottish artist Susan Philipsz's 2010 British Turner Prize win for her piece ""Lowlands"" (overlapping recordings of the artist singing an ancient Scottish lament in three different versions, played back over a loudspeaker system, without any visual component) was seen as an important boost for this relatively new genre (it was the first time a work of sound art won this prestigious prize), and, in winning an art prize, again highlighted the genre's blurred boundaries with other, more visual artforms. In the same year, British artist Haroon Mirza won the Northern Art Prize for his sculptural installation that bought together video, sculptural assemblages and works from Leeds Art Gallery collection to compose a piece of music.  Origin of the term in the United States. The earliest documented use of the term in the U.S. is from a catalogue for a show called ""Sound/Art"" at The Sculpture Center in New York City, created by William Hellerman in 1983. The show was sponsored by ""The SoundArt Foundation,"" which Hellerman founded in 1982. The artists featured in the show were as follows: Vito Acconci, Connie Beckley, Bill and Mary Buchen, Nicolas Collins, Sari Dienes and Pauline Oliveros, Richard Dunlap, Terry Fox, William Hellermann, Jim Hobart, Richard Lerman, Les Levine, Joe Lewis, Tom Marioni, Jim Pomeroy, Alan Scarritt, Carolee Schneeman, Bonnie Sherk, Keith Sonnier, Norman Tuck, Hannah Wilke, Yom Gagatzi. The following is an excerpt from the catalogue essay by art historian Don Goddard: ""It may be that sound art adheres to curator Hellermann's perception that ""hearing is another form of seeing,' that sound has meaning only when its connection with an image is understood... The conjunction of sound and image insists on the engagement of the viewer, forcing participation in real space and concrete, responsive thought rather than illusionary space and thought."" "

Phil departed Eastenders around Christmas 2003, before making a one-off guest appearance in early 2005. He then returned as a regular character in September 2005 along with his mother and his brother. He departed Eastenders on 6 January 2006, before returning as a permanent character in the March of that year.  Phil's most prominent storylines include his battles with alcoholism and addiction, various feuds and criminal dealings, having an affair with Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) who was married to Grant (a storyline popularly dubbed ""Sharongate""), a failed marriage to Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), a strong rivalry with his former step-son Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), his numerous feuds with the likes of Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) and Carl White (Daniel Coonan), and being stalked by his son Ben (Joshua Pascoe), leading to an arrest for the murder of Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), who abused Ben before jumping from a factory roof. One of the most culturally significant storylines featuring the character aired in 2001 and was dubbed ""Who Shot Phil?"". The plot saw Phil gunned down in a whodunnit? mystery, with the would-be assassin eventually revealed as his former girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). The storyline captured viewer and media interest and the assassin-reveal episode was watched by 22 million viewers. Storylines. Backstory. Phil is the eldest child of Peggy and Eric Mitchell. He endured an unhappy childhood due to his abusive father, whose violence continued until Phil was old enough to fight back. Phil and his younger brother Grant were close, and had a reputation for their thuggish behaviour. They were both in their twenties by the time of their father's death in 1985, by which time they had a 10-year-old sister, Samantha. 1990–99. Phil and Grant arrive in Walford to open an automobile repair shop, known as The Arches. Phil later goes into partnership at The Queen Victoria public house with Grant and his fiancée Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), and moves in with them. Phil grows close to Sharon, who turns to him for comfort during Grant's violent outbursts. Sharon and Phil have sex but she stays with Grant, who is unaware of their betrayal. Sharon and Grant's reconciliation is brief, and amidst more rowing and physical violence, Grant is arrested and imprisoned. In his absence, Phil and Sharon continue their affair but when Grant is released, Sharon reconciles with him, leaving Phil heartbroken. On the rebound, Phil enters into a marriage of convenience with Nadia Borovac (Anna Barkan), a Romanian refugee, enabling her to stay in the UK, with Nadia departing after the wedding. Phil begins a romance with Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), but Nadia returns, needing Phil to prove he is her husband to prevent deportation. and moves in with him while she is investigated. Nadia seduces and sleeps with a drunken Phil; he regrets it, denying it to Kathy so Grant threatens to kill her to make her leave but Phil later bribes her into agreeing to a divorce. Kathy agrees to marry Phil in 1994 despite discovering that he torched Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) car lot in an insurance scam, accidentally killing a homeless boy trapped inside. Intent on winning him back, Sharon kisses Phil but he ends things there. During Phil and Kathy's engagement party, Grant listens to a cassette of Sharon admitting to the affair and plays it at the party. Kathy is incensed, and Grant beats Phil so badly that he has go to hospital, due to a blood clot to the brain. Phil undergoes surgery, which stirs remorse in Grant. He pressures Phil into blaming Sharon for their affair and Grant forces her to leave Walford. Phil and Grant make peace but things between them are not the same. Kathy and Phil eventually sort out their differences and marry and they have a son, Ben (Matthew Silver), making Phil feel neglected and depressed so he turns to alcohol and develops an addiction. This makes him abusinve and neglectful towards Kathy and Ben, so Kathy takes Ben and moves out. Realising what he has lost, Phil gives up alcohol and attends Alcoholics Anonymous, which helps reveal the basis of his problem – the physical abuse he received from his father and his fear that he may abuse Ben. He and Kathy reconcile when he attends counselling until he begins an affair with fellow alcoholic Lorna Cartwright (Janet Dibley), who starts stalking him. With his marriage in jeopardy, Phil takes Kathy to Paris and admits his affair with Lorna so Kathy throws her wedding ring into the river. Phil begins sleeping rough, gambling, and blaming Kathy for his decline so she decides to leave Walford for South Africa, letting it be known that an offer of reconciliation from Phil would make her reconsider. Phil is undecided until Lorna stops him going after Kathy by locking herself in his bathroom and attempts suicide. He later follows Kathy to the airport but is stopped by Kathy's son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who persuades him that Kathy and Ben are better off without him. Phil agonises over the loss of his son. To distract himself, Phil gets involved in a protection racket with Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha), who he is also having casual sex with, but grows tired of being bossed around by her and quits. He starts seeing Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), but the relationship stalls when Kathy returns briefly in 1999 and sleeps with Grant. Before Kathy returns to South Africa, she asks Phil to go with her but he declines as Grant has planned an armed robbery and Phil refuses to let him do the job alone. Infuriated by Phil's loyalty to Grant, Kathy reveals their recent tryst, leading to Phil confronting Grant and Grant's confession that he slept with Kathy as revenge for Phil's affair with Sharon. While trying to escape, Phil pulls out a gun and shoots at the dashboard, causing Grant to crash into the River Thames. Phil is rescued and Grant escapes to Brazil. When Grant sends Phil the deeds for his half of The Queen Victoria, he sells it to Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5 to spite Peggy due to her favouritism towards Grant. 2000–07. Phil and Dan's friendship ends after Dan tells the police about a motor scam Phil was involved in and Phil cons Dan into signing the pub over to Peggy. Phil is unsupportive when his girlfriend, Lisa, has a miscarriage and he starts domestically abusing her by getting her sacked from her job and insists she stay at home. This makes her dependent on him so he moves on to her best friend, Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). Lisa is paranoid that Phil is having an affair and accuses Melanie of being his other woman, which she isn't, at that point. However, Melanie is upset by Lisa's accusation and Phil comforts her, leading to a one night stand. Melanie, however, realises it was a mistake and reconciles with Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), making Phil jealous. Lisa decides that a baby will improve their relationship so stops taking contraceptive pills but Phil wants Lisa to leave him, not get pregnant, so he admits to Lisa that he and Melanie slept together. Lisa leaves, keeping quiet about her pregnancy, so when Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) suggests they tell people that the baby is his and Lisa agrees. Phil now has many enemies: Lisa; Steve, who also knows about Melanie and Phil's one night stand; Ian, who Phil bullies mercilessly; Mark, who wants to avenge Lisa; and Dan. On Steve and Melanie's wedding night, Phil is shot and collapses in a pool of blood. Steve is the prime suspect and is arrested but Phil, knowing Steve is innocent, confronts the real culprit, Lisa. Realising he drove her to it, Phil frames Dan. He is assisted by Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt), who gives Dan the gun used to shoot Phil. Unaware that he is being set up, Dan holds Phil at gunpoint, demanding money until he is arrested for attempted murder. Steve is a witness at Dan's trial and gives evidence as agreed with Phil, further implicating Dan but he is cleared and seeks revenge by kidnapping Melanie, threatening to kill her unless they pay him £200,000. Steve and Phil rescue Mel but Dan escapes with the money. Phil reconciles with Sharon when she returns in 2001 and they run The Queen Victoria together. Phil now wants children but Sharon reveals she is infertile and ends the relationship but tells him that he, not Mark, is the father of Lisa's daughter, Louise (Rachel Cox). Phil confronts Lisa, demanding contact. Horrified at this, Steve and Melanie ask Lisa and Louise to emigrate to California with them. She agrees but changes her mind and telephones Steve, asking him to return Louise. He doesn't so Phil attempts to get Louise back, resulting in a car chase that ends when Steve crashes his car into a wall. Phil rescues Louise and the car explodes before he can help Steve. Phil persuades Lisa to return to him and then make it clear that it is Louise they want, not Lisa. They hire a nanny, Joanne Ryan, without consulting her, telling her that Lisa is mentally unstable. Phil demands that Lisa change Louise's name to Mitchell legally and organises a christening. Lisa agrees until some of Phil's relatives, assuming she is the nanny, start talking about how unstable Louise's mother is. Furious at this, she and Louise flee to Portugal, assisted by Phil's nephew, Jamie Mitchell. Phil goes to Portugal and returns a month later with Louise, leading some of Phil's neighbours to suspect that he has murdered Lisa. Phil falls for Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny), unaware that she is an undercover police officer investigating Lisa's disappearance. After Phil confesses that he manipulated Lisa to give him Louise, Kate reveals her true identity and says she loves him and will quit her job, but Phil threatens to kill her. Kate disappears, but several months later, Phil finds her working for gangster Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett). Phil saves Kate's life when Jack orders her dead but Jack demands that Phil kill Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) as repayment. Phil corners Dennis at gunpoint but he and Dennis kill Jack instead, so they can both be free of him. Phil and Kate marry, but Lisa returns on their wedding day, demanding access to Louise and plans to shoot Phil again but fails. She breaks down until Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) vows to get revenge for her. Den plans an armed robbery and persuades Phil to join him but sets Phil up and he is arrested. Lisa tells Kate that she is taking Louise and, unable to stop her legally, Kate agrees but Phil cannot forgive Kate for this and the marriage ends. Phil escapes from prison and confronts Den, who gives him money to survive 'on the run'. Phil returns 18 months later, needing more money; he attacks Ian, who calls the police and Phil is arrested. However, the case collapses after Grant pays a witness to change his testimony and Phil is released. Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) angers Phil when he threatens Peggy. Dennis gets involved when Phil tells him that Johnny has threatened Dennis's wife, Sharon. Dennis attacks Johnny for this so Johnny has Dennis murdered, leaving Phil feeling responsible and vowing to make Johnny pay. Phil and Grant confront Johnny, but he escapes and a car chase ensues. The brothers' squabbling allows Johnny to capture them and Johnny orders Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) to kill them. However, Jake (Joel Beckett) kills Danny and Johnny surrenders. In 2006, following the death of Kathy and her husband, Gavin Sullivan, Ben returns to England and moves in with his half-brother, Ian. Phil and Ben spend time together and they slowly bond, eventually leading to Ben moving in with Phil. Phil starts dating Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), but she mentally and physically abuses Ben, manipulating him into persuading Phil to propose to her. Ben reveals the abuse during the wedding ceremony, and Stella flees to an abandoned warehouse with Phil in pursuit, where she kills herself by jumping from the roof. 2008–. Phil proposes to his girlfriend Suzy Branning (Maggie O'Neill) when she falsely claims that she is pregnant. Phil does not believe his friend, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), when she tells him that Suzy is conning him; he stays with Suzy until he discovers she has schemed with his malevolent uncle, Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). Although troubled by lapses in alcoholism due to numerous family upsets, Phil begins to settle into a relationship with Shirley, who becomes a mother figure for Ben and Louise, who is staying with Phil while Lisa is away. Phil is parted from both his children in 2010: Ben is sent to a juvenile offenders' unit for attacking Jordan Johnson (Michael-Joel David Stuart) and Louise returns to her mother, and then disappears after Lisa promises Phil can have contact at any time. Depressed, Phil starts a sexual relationship with drug addict Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) and starts using crack cocaine, developing an addiction. Peggy locks him inside her home so he cannot have access to drugs, but, suffering withdrawal symptoms, he escapes and confronts Peggy, setting the pub on fire. Within minutes, the pub is ablaze and the roof collapses on Phil. He is rescued and Peggy leaves the next day, realising he is better off without her. Shirley supports Phil through recovery. They steal a large amount of money from Phil's cousin, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), to buy a house together. Roxy's mother, Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) finds out, and propositions Phil so they begin an affair. When Phil discovers Glenda has also had sex with his enemy, Ian Beale, he threatens to tell Ian's wife, Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), unless he pays him £5000. Phil's bullying of Ian almost costs him his life: when Ian finds Phil having a heart attack, he threatens to let him die but helps Phil for Ben's sake. Phil re-evaluates his life following his near-death experience and proposes to Shirley. Shirley initially accepts, but when she discovers Phil's infidelity with Glenda, she forgives him but refuses to marry.  Phil reacts badly when he discovers Ben (now Joshua Pascoe) is gay, and makes it clear that he prefers Billy's (Perry Fenwick) foster son, Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). Jay likes spending time with Phil and changes his surname to Mitchell, becoming Phil's surrogate son. Ben secretly enacts revenge on Phil for this rejection, terrorising him with letters, implying he has evidence to incriminate Phil for past misdemeanours. Among other deeds, Ben sends Denise Fox (Diane Parish) evidence that Phil supplied the cut and shut car responsible for her husband, Kevin Wicks's (Phil Daniels), death in 2008. Denise's attempts to get Phil imprisoned fail; however, DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton), who has had a vendetta against Phil for many years, investigates the allegations and Ben tells her that Phil forced Stella to jump from the roof in 2007. Phil is held on remand in prison on suspicion of Stella's murder and Ben delights in the distress he causes his father. Ian, however, is horrified by Ben's behaviour, and tells the police that Ben is lying; however, Ben thinks Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), Shirley's best friend, is responsible. Fearful and angry, Ben retaliates by murdering Heather just as Phil returns to confront him. Blaming himself for Ben's actions, Phil and Jay make the murder look like a burglary and spurns a grieving Shirley, allows his neighbours and family to become murder suspects, and bullies Ian into keeping quiet after Ben confesses to him. During her charity abseil on top of The Queen Victoria, Shirley proposes to Phil and he accepts. At their engagement party, Sharon Watts returns, begging for help, as she has left her fiancé John Hewland (Jesse Birdsall) at the altar and he has her son, Dennis Rickman Jr (Harry Hickles). Phil helps her to rescue Dennis and they return with Phil to Walford. When Phil gets home, he finds that Shirley knows the truth about Heather's death. After a furious confrontation, he tries to convince her not to tell the police but Ben confesses to the police and is charged with Heather's murder. Jay is charged with perverting the course of justice and Phil orders him to change his statement so Ben will not go to prison, but Jay refuses and Phil disowns him but does manage to convince his cousin, Roxy, to lie in her statement. His solicitor, Ritchie Scott (Sian Webber), tells him that Ben could face a minimum of 10 years in prison. Shirley ends her relationship with Phil as she is unable to cope with his betrayal. Phil visits Ben in prison with Ian in the hope of persuading Ben to retract his confession but Ben refuses, insisting that he is doing the right thing as he needs to be punished. Ben refuses to have any contact with his family until his release. After Ben's departure, Phil bonds with Sharon's son, Dennis Rickman (Harry Hickles). When Billy's great-granddaughter, Lexi Pearce, is taken into care, Lexi's mother Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) tells Phil that Ben is Lexi's father and Phil is her grandfather. Lola agrees for Phil to have residence of Lexi and he suggests to Sharon that they pretend to be in a relationship to increase the chances of success, even though she is in a relationship with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). They tell social workers that they are engaged but Shirley threatens to tell the truth, so Phil tells them the engagement is over. Phil is appointed Lexi's foster carer and ordered to arrange for Lola to visit Lexi three times a week but he immediately takes over, angering Lola by calling Lexi his baby, refusing to take presents that Lola buys for her and having her christened with the name Mitchell instead of Pearce. Phil and Jack become rivals when Phil tells Jack that he will be with Sharon by the end of the year, and Phil even proposes to Sharon, though she accepts Jack's proposal of marriage instead. When Phil offers Sharon an increase of her salary, and a 19% stake in club, Jack is not pleased and punches Phil, who falls into the vehicle pit in the garage. Jack thinks he has killed Phil, but Phil later arrives at the pub and announces Jack's guilt. Jack is arrested but Phil does not press charges after Sharon convinces him for her and Lexi's sake. At the court hearing to determine Lexi's future, Phil exposes Lola's lateness and temper during her scheduled meetings with Lexi, sabotaging her chances of winning Lexi back. He later tells Billy that Lola will never get Lexi back, which Lola overhears. She snatches Lexi from his house. Lola evades Phil, Billy and Sharon, until eventually they find her. Phil tells Social Services it is his fault for being too relaxed with Lola, but then allows Lola to look after Lexi while he goes out. When Lexi is unwell, Phil praises Lola's actions, and decides to tell Social Services that Lola may be ready to have Lexi back.  Phil and Sharon reunite after her relationship with Jack ends. However, it ends when Sharon's painkiller addiction puts Lexi in danger. Lola then regains full custody of Lexi, leaving Phil feeling lonely. When Shirley's benefits are cut and she is forced to move out of the B&B, Phil secretly pays her rent. Shirley finds out and believes he is doing it so she will stay quiet about his involvement in Heather's death. Shirley demands money from Phil, which he does not have, forcing him to accept a deal from newcomer Carl White (Daniel Coonan). Carl wants to depose Phil as the top man in Albert Square, so as they drive off, Carl deliberately crashes the car, causing Phil to be thrown through the windscreen. He is airlifted to hospital and requires an operation. While he is recovering, he puts his cousin Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) in charge of his businesses, though Carl tries to intimidate her and use the garage for illegal purposes. Creation. In late 1989 ""EastEnders"" acquired a new executive producer, Michael Ferguson, who took over from Mike Gibbon. Ferguson had previously been a producer on ITV's ""The Bill"" which seemed to be challenging ""EastEnders"" in providing a realistic vision of modern life in London. Due to his success on ""The Bill"", Peter Cregeen, the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of ""EastEnders"". For the roles of Phil and Grant Mitchell many actors were screen-tested together. This was done to assure the chosen actors – who would work together – had a strong rapport and physical resemblance. Producer Corinne Hollingworth commented: ""There were some good actors we had to turn down because we couldn't find the 'right' brother."" Steve McFadden, an actor who had worked extensively in television, was cast as Phil. His shape, skills in stage fighting and a variety of sports including boxing, football and karate made him an ideal choice to play one of Walford's latest ""tough-men."" Ross Kemp got the role of Grant. Both actors worked well together and shared similar physical characteristics, such as short cropped hair and a ""round, open face"" – facial characteristics also shared by Danniella Westbrook, who was chosen to play their sister Samantha because of this. Personality. Of the two brothers Phil was initially calmer, but both had a sense of physical danger about them, displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Phil was originally depicted as the thinker and the most streetwise of the pair, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble, although later plotlines drove the character down a darker, more destructive route. Phil can be violent, but unlike Grant, he occasionally showed restraint when dealing with various enemies encountered – exacting revenge over time, using mind games or getting others to do his dirty work. Phil has occasionally shown sadistic traits. His bullying of Ian Beale is often done as a means of deriving pleasure. Equally the ceaseless degradation of Lisa showed a particularly malicious side to the character. While Phil has shown compassion to the women in his life, he frequently finds he is unable to give them the emotional security needed to sustain the relationship. Several women have left him due to this and his inability to put their needs before the needs of his family. Character development and impact. The Mitchell brothers quickly became two of the soap's most popular characters and storylines involving them began to dominate the programme. Their arrival heralded a new era for the soap, which aptly coincided with the beginning of a new decade – ""EastEnders"" during the 1980s having been very much dominated by the hugely popular Watts family. Sharongate. One of the most notable and popular early storylines involving Phil was a love triangle between him, his brother and his brother's wife Sharon (played by Letitia Dean). Despite the fact that Sharon was married to Grant, ""EastEnders"" writer Tony Jordan revealed in ""The Mitchells – The Full Story"" that the love-triangle storyline had been planned since Phil and Grant's introduction, after the writers decided Sharon was perfect for them both. This storyline was slow burning and spread over several years, providing a plethora of dramatic tension along the way. The episode in which Phil betrayed his brother with Sharon occurred in September 1992 in one of the soap's notorious three-handers. Things finally came to a head in 1994 with some of ""EastEnders"" most popular and renowned episodes, which were dubbed ""Sharongate"" – centred around Grant's discovery of the affair and his reaction. The repercussions of Phil's betrayal contributed to many subsequent storylines involving the Mitchell brothers during the 1990s. Sharongate has also proven a popular storyline with viewers and it was voted the sixth top soap opera moment of the decade in a poll of 17,000 people for ""What's On TV"" magazine. Alcoholism. Among the many issues Phil has been used to cover is alcoholism and the consequences the condition has upon the sufferer's life. The relationship between alcohol abuse and domestic violence was explored between Phil and his wife Kathy (played by Gillian Taylforth) culminating in the slow deterioration of their marriage, which gripped viewers throughout 1997. Of particular note is an episode where Phil attends Alcoholics Anonymous (February 1997), an ""alien and uncomfortable arena"" where he was forced to talk about his condition, expose his vulnerability and reveal the basis of his problem – the physical abuse he'd received from his father and his fear that he will do the same. Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the show, evaluated the episode in an article about social realism, education and the moral messages within ""EastEnders"" storylines, commenting: ""The episode blames his destructiveness on the 'male' response to self-hate: violence. It says that unless problems are worked through (the female method), they will be repeated generation after generation"". This particular episode has also been used in a study by the Stirling Media Research Institute, where men were asked questions about the violence contained within a spectrum of broadcast television material. The study reported that much group discussion centred on the Alcoholics Anonymous group scene, which was, for the most part, seen as an accurate depiction of an AA group therapy session. In addition, Phil's portrayal of a suffering alcoholic was also seen as realistic and a ""typical portrayal of bottled-up masculinity"". The Mitchell car crash. Phil's disposition altered during the early 2000s when a darker more menacing side to his personality began to surface. This change was perhaps a consequence of Grant's departure, who up until this point had always been depicted as the more selfish, thuggish and nastier of the two. The storyline signifying the departure of Ross Kemp played heavily on the Mitchell brothers' fragile and damaged relationship. After discovering that Grant had vengefully slept with Kathy, Phil went ballistic with a handgun causing the hijacked Vauxhall Astra they were driving to career at high speed into the River Thames, in an episode that was watched by 19.5 million viewers. Shot in London's Docklands, the scenes required stunt doubles, divers and crash test dummies and it has been hailed as ""one of the soap's most dramatic storylines ever."" Who Shot Phil? Phil's behaviour earned him a number of sworn enemies in Albert Square and by 2001 the character had become one of the soap's nastiest villains. In an interview with ""The Guardian"" McFadden commented on his alter ego's descent into villainy ""Phil's been had over by a lot of people, so now he feels like he can do it back. It's his history"". However the character finally received his comeuppance in one of ""EastEnders"" most highly anticipated storylines, dubbed ""Who Shot Phil?"". Phil was gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a """"Dallas""-style"" whodunnit mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which of them was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed and it was reported that only a few TV executives knew the identity of the would-be assassin – even the actors were kept in the dark. A spokesman commented ""The cast are only getting their own scripts. They are not being told anyone else's storylines. Not even Phil knows who shot him. It's top secret."" Script writers were reportedly given private security after a writer's laptop was stolen in what was believed to be an attempt to gain the identity of the assailant. The storyline captivated the public's imagination leading to thousands of bets being placed at the bookies across the UK – bookmaker William Hill said there was about 50,000 bets on who was responsible. An estimated 22 million viewers watched ""EastEnders"" on 5 April 2001 to find out that Lisa Shaw – Phil's ex-girlfriend – was the culprit. The episode caused the third-largest power surge on record, and the Liverpool and Barcelona UEFA Cup semi-final was postponed for 10 minutes to accommodate a special 40-minute edition of the soap. Temporary exit (2003). In February 2003, it was confirmed that Steve McFadden would be taking a year hiatus. McFadden said: ""I’m going to stick my mechanic’s overalls in a locker while I take a look at a few other projects. EastEnders will always be No1 in my heart and I look forward to returning to Albert Square."" Executive producer Louise Berridge went on to say that she was ""looking forward to Steve returning in 2004"". In July 2004, it was announced that McFadden had delayed his return. In February 2005, it was confirmed that McFadden would return. His return scenes aired in September 2005. Drug addiction. In June 2010, it was reported that Phil would develop an addiction to crack cocaine after his troubled personal life leads to depression. The report followed the news that Lucy Benjamin was to return for a single episode, reprising her role as Lisa, the mother of Phil's daughter Louise (Brittany Papple). In the storyline, Phil gains custody of Louise after she is dropped off in Walford by an unseen person, however, Peggy eventually returns Louise to Lisa after Phil punches his mother in the face. A spokesperson for the show said ""Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life – she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline is going to be an explosive episode in the Mitchells' history."" Phil also loses his son Ben (Charlie Jones), who makes a temporary departure from the show in order for the part to be recast. Subsequently, Phil becomes addicted to crack cocaine. Producers worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope. Viewers never see Phil take drugs to make sure the episodes are suitable for all audiences. Martin Barnes, chief executive of DrugScope, commented: ""If ""EastEnders"" sensitively reflect the impact that drug use has on Phil, it could help."" The storyline also sees Phil become more violent. McFadden explained: McFadden decided to lose weight for the storyline by going on a crash diet, saying that food would not be one of Phil's priorities. Other storylines. The character continues to be featured heavily in high-profile storylines which have included various feuds, police enquiries, armed robbery, kidnapping, numerous affairs and relationship problems and an ongoing plot concentrating on the character's struggles to bond with his children. 2005 saw the highly anticipated screen return of both of the Mitchell brothers – six years since they last appeared together. 13 million viewers tuned in to see their return giving the BBC a 52.9% audience share, a massive coup for the show which had come under heavy criticism in the British media after it drew its lowest audience in more than five years (6.6 million viewers tuning in to one episode in September 2005). Reception. Popularity. The character of Phil is arguably one of the soap's most popular, particularly with female viewers, making him one of the soap's unlikeliest sex symbols. He has featured in some of the show's most memorable and highly viewed storylines and he is the second longest running male character to appear in the soap, surpassed only by Ian Beale. Phil along with Grant was voted as the second most popular ""King Of Soaps"" in a Channel 4 poll in 2002. During a period of heavy media criticism aimed at ""EastEnders"" throughout 2004 and 2005, the character—who was on a hiatus from the show—was reintroduced twice in what was branded by the press as a bid to ""boost flagging ""Enders"""" and ""revive the soap's ailing ratings"". His first return in April 2005 was generally well-received, with media comments such as ""the excellent, bug-eyed Steve McFadden proves nobody does psychotic thug better than him"" and ""McFadden's blistering performance on Tuesday defies that old cliché of a soap being bigger than its stars"". Of the Mitchell brothers' highly publicised return in October 2005, a reporter from the ""Daily Mirror"" commented ""Soapville must confess that we did get goosebumps and feel properly excited when we first saw the Mitchell Brothers back on the Square...After all, you associate them with the golden days of ""Enders"""". In addition the character has been praised for being good value, realistic, consistent within his character and convincing.  In 2009, Phil Mitchell came second in a poll by British men's magazine ""Loaded"" for 'Top Soap Bloke'. In 2011 McFadden was nominated for 'Best Actor' at the British Soap Awards 2011 for playing Phil. as well as be nominated at the Inside Soap Awards for 'Best Actor' in 2011. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, McFadden was nominated for ""Best Male Soap Actor"" and came fourth with 10.7% of the vote. Criticism. Although popular with many, the character has also garnered much criticism over the years. In November 2005 the character was blamed for turning children into playground bullies by Dr. Sally Henry, who claimed that impressionable children look to male soap characters as role models and subsequently copy their violent behaviour. Indeed the character's violent behaviour evoked concern from viewers in October 2002. A scene in which Phil beat his godson Jamie was criticised for being too realistic by TV watchdogs. The Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld 31 complaints from viewers, saying that the scenes were too strong for a programme shown before the 9 pm watershed. A certain level of criticism was aimed at the character due to the stark personality change he underwent circa 2000. One reporter commented ""Formerly the milder-mannered sibling, Phil has gone from Abel to Cain without an intervening period of plausibility. And it doesn't suit him"". His violent tendencies have also been spoofed by the television series ""2DTV"". There were mixed reviews for the highly publicised storyline (dubbed Get Johnny Week) involving the Mitchell brothers reunion in 2006. It was criticised as ""patchy"" and ""awkwardly written...unveiling a common weakness in the EastEnders camp, that character continuity can often fall by the wayside when you are dealing with larger characters"". Additionally, the show was criticised for turning the brothers into a comical farce by incorporating uncharacteristic humour into their dialect, which was described as ""cringeworthy"". In August 2010, scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying """"EastEnders"" in no way – and at no point – glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. We feel that Phil's decline will highlight the destructive nature of drugs, and rather than encourage drug use, will act as a deterrent."" A former cocaine addict, Sarah Graham, agreed with the BBC, saying ""I think it's really important that a mainstream character like Phil Mitchell is doing this storyline. [...] I'm not surprised that there have been so many complaints about seeing this on one of our favourite soaps. The episode showed the brutal reality of addiction. [...] I can see that many people will be worried about children watching these scenes. [...] With that in mind, I think they should put the Frank drugs helpline number on after the programme.""

wikipedia-1457484," Roll-on/roll-off  Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ships are vessels designed to carry wheeled cargo, such as automobiles, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, trailers, and railroad cars, that are driven on and off the ship on their own wheels. This is in contrast to lift-on/lift-off (LOLO) vessels, which use a crane to load and unload cargo. RORO vessels have built-in ramps that allow the cargo to be efficiently rolled on and off the vessel when in port. While smaller ferries that operate across rivers and other short distances often have built-in ramps, the term RORO is generally reserved for larger oceangoing vessels. The ramps and doors may be stern-only, or bow and stern for quick loading. Types. Types of RORO vessels include ferries, cruiseferries, cargo ships, and barges. New automobiles that are transported by ship are often moved on a large type of RORO called a pure car carrier (PCC) or pure car/truck carrier (PCTC). Elsewhere in the shipping industry, cargo is normally measured by the metric tonne, but RORO cargo is typically measured in ""lanes in metres"" (LIMs). This is calculated by multiplying the cargo length in metres by the number of decks and by its width in lanes (lane width differs from vessel to vessel, and there are several industry standards). On PCCs, cargo capacity is often measured in RT or RT43 units (based on a 1966 Toyota) or in car-equivalent units (CEU). The largest RORO passenger ferry is , a 75,100 GT cruise ferry that entered service in September 2007 for Color Line. Built in Finland by Aker Finnyards, it is long and wide, and can carry 550 cars, or 1270 lane meters of cargo. The RORO passenger ferry with the greatest car-carrying capacity is the ""Ulysses"" (named after a novel by James Joyce), owned by Irish Ferries. The ""Ulysses"" entered service on 25 March 2001 and operates between Dublin and Holyhead. The 50,938 GT ship is long and wide, and can carry 1342 cars/4101 lane meters of cargo. History. At first, wheeled vehicles carried as cargo on oceangoing ships were treated like any other cargo. Automobiles had their fuel tanks emptied and their batteries disconnected before being hoisted into the ship’s hold, where they were chocked and secured. This process was tedious and difficult, and vehicles were subject to damage and could not be used for routine travel. The world's first roll-on/roll-off service was a train ferry, started in 1833 by the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway, which operated a wagon ferry on the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland. During World War II, landing ships were among the first seagoing ships enabling road vehicles to roll directly on and off. Postwar, the idea was adopted for merchant ships and short ferry crossings. The first RORO service crossing the English Channel began from Dover in 1953. The first roll-on/roll-off vessel that was purpose-built to transport loaded semi trucks was the ""Searoad of Hyannis"", which began operation in 1956. While modest in capacity, it could transport three semi trailers between Hyannis in Massachusetts and Nantucket Island, even in ice conditions.  In 1957, the US military issued a contract to the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Chester, Pennsylvania, for the construction of a new type of motorized vehicle carrier. The ship, the ""Comet"", had a stern ramp as well as interior ramps, which allowed cars to drive directly from the dock, onto the ship, and into place. Loading and unloading was sped up dramatically. ""Comet"" also had an adjustable chocking system for locking cars onto the decks and a ventilation system to remove exhaust gases that accumulate during vehicle loading. During the 1982 Falklands War, SS ""Atlantic Conveyor"" was requisitioned as an emergency aircraft and helicopter transport for British Hawker Siddeley Harrier STOVL fighter planes; one Harrier was kept fueled, armed, and ready to VTOL launch for emergency air protection against long range Argentine aircraft. The ""Atlantic Conveyor"" was sunk by Argentine Exocet missiles after offloading the Harriers to proper aircraft carriers, but the vehicles and helicopters still aboard were destroyed. After the war, a concept called the shipborne containerized air-defense system (SCADS) proposed a modular system to quickly convert a large RORO into an emergency aircraft carrier with ski jump, fueling systems, radar, defensive missiles, munitions, crew quarters, and work spaces. The entire system could be installed in about 48 hours on a container ship or RORO, when needed for operations up to a month unsupplied. The system could quickly be removed and stored again when the conflict was over. The Soviets flying Yakovlev Yak-38 fighters also tested operations using the civilian RORO ships ""Agostinio Neto"" and ""Nikolai Cherkasov"". Car carriers. Since 1970 the market for exporting and importing cars has increased dramatically and the number and type of ROROs has increased also. In 1973, Japan’s K Line built the ""European Highway"", the first pure car carrier (PCC), which carried 4,200 automobiles. Today’s pure car carriers and their close cousins, the pure car/truck carrier (PCTC) are distinctive ships with a box-like superstructure running the entire length and breadth of the hull, fully enclosing the cargo. They typically have a stern ramp and a side ramp for dual loading of thousands of vehicles (such as cars, trucks, heavy machineries, tracked units, Mafi trailers, and loose statics), and extensive automatic fire control systems. The PCTC has liftable decks to increase vertical clearance, as well as heavier decks for ""high-and-heavy"" cargo. A 6,500-unit car ship with 12 decks can have three decks, which can take cargo up to with liftable panels to increase clearance from on some decks. Lifting decks to accommodate higher cargo reduces the total capacity. These kind of vessels perform a usual speed of 16 knots at eco-speed, while at full speed more than 19 knots can be achieved.  With the building of Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics's 8,000-CEU car carrier ""Faust"" out of Stockholm in June 2007 car carriers entered a new era of the large car and truck carrier (LCTC). Currently, the largest are Wilh. Wilhelmsen's ""Mark V"" ships, led by MV ""Tønsberg"". The car carrier ""Auriga Leader"", built in 2008 with a capacity of 6,200 cars, is the world's first partially solar powered ship. Seaworthiness. The seagoing RORO car ferry, with large external doors close to the waterline and open vehicle decks with few internal bulkheads, has a reputation for being a high-risk design, to the point where the acronym is sometimes derisively expanded to ""roll on/roll over""). An improperly secured loading door can cause a ship to take on water and sink, as happened in 1987 with . Water sloshing on the vehicle deck can set up a free surface effect, making the ship unstable and causing it to capsize. Free surface water on the vehicle deck was determined by the Court of Inquiry to be the immediate cause of the 1968 capsize of the in New Zealand. Despite these inherent risks, the very high freeboard raises the seaworthiness of these vessels. For example, the car carrier listed 80 degrees to its port side in 2006, but did not sink, since its high enclosed sides prevented water from entering. Some RORO ship casualties are mentioned here. Variations of RORO. ROPAX. The acronym ROPAX (roll-on/roll-off passenger) describes a RORO vessel built for freight vehicle transport along with passenger accommodation. Technically this encompasses all ferries with both a roll-on/roll-off car deck and passenger-carrying capacities, but in practice, ships with facilities for more than 500 passengers are often referred to as cruiseferries. ConRO. The ConRo vessel is a hybrid of a RORO and a container ship. This type of vessel has a below-deck area used for vehicle storage while stacking containerized freight on the top decks. ConRo ships, such as those in the fleet of Atlantic Container Line, can carry a combination of 1,900 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of containers, up to 1,000 TEU of heavy equipment, project and oversized cargo on three decks, and up to 2,000 automobiles on five decks. Separate internal ramp systems within the vessel segregate automobiles from other vehicles, Mafi trailers, and break-bulk cargo. RoLo. A RoLo (roll-on/lift-off) vessel is another hybrid vessel type, with ramps serving vehicle decks but with other cargo decks only accessible when the tides change or by the use of a crane. LMSR. Large, Medium-Speed Roll-on/Roll-off (LMSR) refers to several classes of Military Sealift Command (MSC) roll-on/roll-off type cargo ships. Some are purpose-built to carry military cargo, while others are converted. "

wikipedia-11173883," Bhartṛhari  In the medieval tradition of Indian scholarship, it was assumed that both texts were written by the same person.  Modern philologists were sceptical of this claim, owing to an argument that dated the grammar to a date subsequent to the poetry. Since the 1990s, however, scholars have that both works may indeed have been contemporary, in which case it is plausible that there was only one Bhartrihari who wrote both texts. Both the grammar and the poetic works had an enormous influence in their respective fields.  The grammar in particular, takes a holistic view of language, countering the compositionality position of the Mimamsakas and others.  The poetry constitute short verses, collected into three centuries of about a hundred poems each. Each century deals with a different rasa or aesthetic mood; on the whole his poetic work has been very highly regarded both within the tradition and by modern scholarship.  The name Bhrartrihari is also sometimes associated with Bhartrihari traya Shataka, the legendary king of Ujjaini in the 1st century. Date and identity. The account of the Chinese traveller Yi-Jing indicates that Bhartrihari's grammar was known by 670 CE, and that he may have been Buddhist, which the poet was not. Based on this, scholarly opinion had formerly attributed the grammar to a separate author of the same name from the 7th century CE. However, other evidence indicates a much earlier date: A period of 450–500 ""definitely not later than 425–450"", or, following Erich Frauwallner, 450–510 or perhaps 400 CE or even earlier. Yi-Jing's other claim, that Bhartrihari was a Buddhist, does not seem to hold; his philosophical position is widely held to be an offshoot of the Vyakaran or grammarian school, closely allied to the realism of the Naiyayikas and distinctly opposed to Buddhist positions like Dignaga, who are closer to phenomenalism. It is also opposed to other mImAMsakas like Kumarila Bhatta. However, some of his ideas subsequently influenced some Buddhist schools, which may have led Yi-Jing to surmise that he may have been Buddhist.  Thus, on the whole seems likely that the traditional Sanskritist view, that the poet of the ""Śatakatraya"" is the same as the grammarian Bhartṛhari, may be accepted. The leading Sanskrit scholar Ingalls (1968) submitted that ""I see no reason why he should not have written poems as well as grammar and metaphysics"", like Dharmakirti, Shankaracharya, and many others. Yi Jing himself appeared to think they were the same person, as he wrote that (the grammarian) Bhartṛhari, author of the Vakyapadiya, was renowned for his vacillation between Buddhist monkhood and a life of pleasure, and for having written verses on the subject. Vākyapadīya. Bhartrihari's views on language build on that of earlier grammarians such as Patanjali, but were quite radical. A key element of his conception of language is the notion of ""sphoṭa"" - a term that may be based on an ancient grammarian, ""Sphoṭāyana"", referred by Pāṇini, now lost.  In his Mahabhashya, Patanjali (2nd century BCE) uses the term ""sphoṭa"" to denote the sound of language, the universal, while the actual sound (""dhvani"") may be long or short, or vary in other ways. This distinction may be thought to be similar to that of the present notion of phoneme. Bhatrihari however, applies the term sphota to each element of the utterance, ""varṇa"" the letter or syllable, ""pada"" the word, and ""vākya"" the sentence. In order to create the linguistic invariant, he argues that these must be treated as separate wholes (""varṇasphoṭa"", ""padasphoṭa"" and ""vākyasphoṭa"" respectively). For example, the same speech sound or ""varṇa"" may have different properties in different word contexts (e.g. assimilation), so that the sound cannot be discerned until the whole word is heard.  Further, Bhartrihari argues for a sentence-holistic view of meaning, saying that the meaning of an utterance is known only after the entire sentence (""vākyasphoṭa"") has been received, and it is not composed from the individual atomic elements or linguistic units which may change their interpretation based on later elements in the utterance. Further, words are understood only in the context of the sentence whose meaning as a whole is known. His argument for this was based on language acquisition, e.g. consider a child observing the exchange below: The child observing this may now learn that the unit ""horse"" refers to the animal. Unless the child knew the sentence meaning ""a priori"", it would be difficult for him to infer the meaning of novel words. Thus, we grasp the sentence meaning as a whole, and reach words as parts of the sentence, and word meanings as parts of the sentence meaning through ""analyis, synthesis and abstraction"" (""apoddhāra"").  The sphoṭa theory was influential, but it was opposed by many others. Later Mimamsakas like Kumarila Bhatta (c. 650 CE) strongly rejected the vākyasphoṭaview, and argued for the denotative power of each word, arguing for the composition of meanings (""abhihitānvaya""). The Prabhakara school (c. 670) among Mimamsakas however took a less atomistic position, arguing that word meanings exist, but are determined by context (""anvitābhidhāna""). Śatakatraya. Bhartrihari's poetry is aphoristic, and comments on the social mores of the time. The collected work is known as ""Śatakatraya"" ""the three ""śatakas"" or 'hundreds' ('centuries')"", consisting of three thematic compilations on ""shringara"", ""vairagya"" and ""niti"" (loosely: love, dispassion and moral conduct) of hundred verses each.  Unfortunately, the extant manuscript versions of these shatakas vary widely in the verses included. D.D. Kosambi has has identified a kernel of two hundred that are common to all the versions.  Here is a sample that comments on social mores: And here is one dealing with the theme of love: "

wikipedia-5231097," Mimi Smith  Mary Elizabeth ""Mimi"" Smith (née Stanley) (24 April 1903 – 6 December 1991) was the maternal aunt and parental guardian of the English musician, John Lennon. Mimi Stanley was born in Liverpool, England; the oldest of five daughters. She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, and later worked as a private secretary. On 15 September 1939, she married George Smith, who ran his family's dairy farm and a shop in Woolton; a suburb of Liverpool.  After her younger sister, Julia Lennon, separated from her husband, she and her son (Lennon), moved in with a new partner, but Mimi contacted Liverpool's Social Services and complained about him sleeping in the same bed as the two adults. Julia was eventually persuaded to hand the care of Lennon over to the Smiths. Lennon lived with the Smiths for most of his childhood, and remained close to his aunt, even though she was highly dismissive of his musical ambitions, his girlfriends, and wives.  She often told the teenage Lennon: ""The guitar's all right John, but you'll never make a living out of it"". In 1965, Lennon bought her a bungalow in Poole, Dorset, where she lived until her death in 1991. Despite later losing touch with other family members, Lennon kept in close contact and telephoned her every week, until his death in 1980. The Smiths' house in Liverpool was later donated to The National Trust. The Stanley family. According to Lennon, the Stanley family once owned the whole of Woolton village. Mimi's father, George Stanley, was born in the Everton district of Liverpool in 1874, and became a sailor. Her mother, Annie Jane Millward, was born in Chester around 1875, to Welsh parents. Annie's first two children, a boy and a girl, died shortly after birth, and she had five additional children: Mary, known as 'Mimi'; Elizabeth 'Mater' (1903 to 1991); Anne 'Nanny' (1911–1988); Julia 'Judy' (1914–1958); and Harriet 'Harrie' (1916–1972). After the birth of his daughters, Stanley retired from sailing and found a job with the Liverpool and Glasgow Tug Salvage Company as an insurance investigator. He moved his family to the Liverpool suburb of Allerton, where they lived in a small terraced house at 9 Newcastle Road. According to Beatles biographer Bob Spitz, Mimi assumed a matriarchal role in the Stanley house to help her mother, and dressed ""as if she was on her way to a weekly garden club meeting"". Friends of Lennon later stated that his aunt based everything on decorum, honesty, and a black-and-white attitude: ""Either you were good enough or you were not."" Lennon's school friend, Pete Shotton, later commented that she ""had a very strong sense of what was right or wrong"". Annie Stanley died in 1945, so Mimi accepted the responsibility of caring for her father, with help from her younger sister, Julia. When other girls were thinking of marriage, Mimi talked of challenges and adventures that arose from her attitude of ""stubborn independence"", and often said that she never wanted to get married because she hated the idea of being ""tied to the kitchen sink"". She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, and later worked as a private secretary for Ernest Vickers, who was an industrial magnate with businesses in Manchester and Liverpool. She had long-term plans to buy a house in a ""respected suburb"" of Liverpool one day so that she could entertain the ""scholars and dignitaries of Liverpool society"". Marriage and 'Mendips'. In early 1932 she met George Smith, who lived across from the hospital where she worked, and to which he delivered milk every morning. Smith and his brother, Frank Smith, operated a dairy farm and a shop in Woolton that had been in the Smith family for four generations. Smith started courting Mimi, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. Stanley would only allow the couple to sit in the back room at Newcastle Road when he or his wife were in the front room, and before it grew too late he would burst into the back room and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting. After delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, ""or nothing at all!"" Mimi and Smith were finally married on 15 September 1939. They bought a semi-detached house called Mendips—named after the range of hills—at 251 Menlove Avenue, in a middle class area of Liverpool. Menlove Avenue suffered extensive damage during World War II, and she said that she often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in the garden. During the war the government took over the Smiths' farmland for war work, and Smith was called up for service, but was discharged three years later, working in an aircraft factory in Speke until the end of the war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led Mimi to complain later that he was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money. Mimi and John Lennon. Julia Stanley married Alfred ""Alf"" Lennon on 3 December 1938, and on 9 October 1940, the couple's first and only child was born. Mimi phoned the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital that evening and was told that Julia had given birth to a boy. According to Mimi, she went straight to the hospital during the middle of an air raid, and was forced to hide in doorways to avoid the shrapnel. She ran, as she later recalled, ""as fast as my legs could carry me"". When a parachute-borne landmine fell outside the hospital, she later said, ""My sister stayed in bed, and they put the baby [Lennon under the bed. They wanted me to go into the basement, but I wouldn't. I ran all the way back to Newcastle Road to tell father the news. 'Get under the shelter,' the wardens were shouting. 'Oh, be quiet,' I told them."" [Note: The story about the air-raid has since been repudiated. as there was no attack that night. The previous raid had been on 21–22 September, and the next was on 16 October, when the areas of Walton and Everton were badly hit. After Julia separated from her husband, she and the infant Lennon moved in with her new partner, John Albert ""Bobby"" Dykins, but Mimi twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services and complained about Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins. Julia was eventually persuaded to hand the care of Lennon over to the Smiths, who had no children of their own. Mimi later confided to a relative that although she had never wanted children, she had ""always wanted John"". In July 1946, Alf Lennon visited the Smiths and took Lennon to Blackpool, ostensibly for a long holiday, but with the secret intention of emigrating to New Zealand with him. Julia went to Blackpool and took Lennon back to her house, but a few weeks later she handed him back over to Mimi. Lennon then lived continuously at Mendips, in the smallest bedroom above the front door. Although she was a caring guardian, she was also known for being very strict, compared to the more relaxed influence of her husband and Lennon's mother. Family friends described Mimi as stubborn, impatient, and unforgiving, but also said that she had a strong sense of humour. On many occasions when she criticised Lennon, he would respond with a joke, and the two of them would be ""rolling around, laughing together"".  Mimi bought volumes of short stories for Lennon, and her husband taught Lennon to read at the age of five by reading aloud the headlines of the ""Liverpool Echo"". Every summer, from the age of nine until he was fifteen, she sent Lennon alone on a ten-hour bus journey to visit his Aunt Mater and cousin Stanley Parkes at their home near Loch Meadie in Durness, Scotland. Mimi also took her charge to a garden party in Calderstones Park every year, where a Salvation Army band played. She remembered Lennon pulling her by the hand to get there, saying, ""Hurry up Mimi – we’re going to be late"". Strawberry Field, in Beaconsfield Road, was the name of a Salvation Army house that Lennon would later immortalise in the Beatles' song, ""Strawberry Fields Forever"". She would later say: ""John loved his uncle George . I felt quite left out of that. They'd go off together, just leaving me a bar of chocolate and a note saying, 'Have a happy day'"".  Smith died of a liver haemorrhage in June 1953, at the age of fifty, leaving £2000 in his will. The Smiths had rented their two first-floor bedrooms to students for extra income since 1947, while the Smiths slept in the former dining room; on the ground floor, at the back of the house. Some of the students who lodged there included John Cavill (from September 1949 until June 1950). Cavill played piano, but as the house had none he bought a guitar; admitting he knew almost nothing about chords: ""My father had a violin and I had learned to play pizzicato on it, so when I got the guitar I played tunes on the strings, and John did the same"". Michael Fishwick also lodged there (from October 1951 until December 1958), as did Keith Capron (September 1956 to July 1959). Both Capron and Cavill were studying veterinary science at the University of Liverpool, with Fishwick studying biochemistry. Five years after Smith's death, Lennon's mother was killed on Menlove Avenue—shortly after a visit to Mendips—when she was knocked down by a car driven by a drunk, off-duty police officer; PC Eric Clague. Mimi did not witness the accident, but shortly after was seen crying hysterically over Julia's body until the ambulance arrived. Clague was acquitted of all charges, given a reprimand, and a short suspension from duty. When Mimi heard the verdict she shouted ""Murderer!"" at Clague. After Lennon became famous, she berated him for speaking in a Liverpudlian accent, but Lennon replied: ""That's showbusiness, they want me to speak more Liverpool"". Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, ""I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that"". Lennon and music. Although Mimi later claimed that she had bought Lennon's first guitar, it was actually his mother, after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks. Julia insisted that the £5 instrument had to be delivered to her house and not to her sister's. The two sisters first saw Lennon perform with the Quarrymen at the Woolton St. Peter's Church fête on the afternoon of 6 July 1957. Julia (who knew that her son would be performing) heard music coming from the field behind the church (now the site of the Bishop Martin School), and pulled Mimi along with her to listen. Lennon saw his aunt coming through the crowd and comically changed the words of a song to feature her name: ""Oh-oh, here comes Mimi down the aisle now..."" Mimi related two versions of what she thought that day after seeing Lennon on stage: ""I was horrified to behold John in front of a microphone"", and ""as pleased as Punch to see him up there"". With help from Mimi and Lennon's headmaster, Lennon was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art because his aunt insisted that he should have some sort of academic qualifications, even though Lennon was beginning to show an interest in music. She opposed the idea of him forming a band and disapproved of McCartney because he was, ""working class"", calling him ""John's little friend"". When she later met Harrison, she ""hated him"" because of his thick Liverpudlian accent and Teddy Boy clothes. Lennon and McCartney often met at Mendips to write songs, and rehearsed in the glass-panelled porch at the front of the house, which was the only place they were allowed to play. She once asked Parkes to take her to The Cavern to see Lennon and the Beatles play, but when she descended into the damp, dark cellar; full of screaming teenagers, she shouted to Parkes, ""Get him out, get him out! Tell him to come off the stage! He can't stay here... We'll have to stop this!"" The band's first residency in Hamburg exasperated her because she wanted Lennon to continue his studies, but he placated her by greatly exaggerating the sum of money he would earn.  She hoped Lennon would become bored with music; often saying, ""The guitar's all right John, but you'll never make a living out of it"". In later years, Lennon would jokingly remind her of the comment, and later had a silver plaque made engraved with her words. When later asked about the plaque, she would say that Lennon had it made for her husband, and not her. Lennon's relationships. Mimi's attitude to Lennon's partners was often frosty, disdainful, or sarcastic. She constantly criticised Lennon about his relationships. Mimi once referred to Cynthia, Lennon's first wife, as ""a gangster's moll"", and was particularly unpleasant or cold towards her. In the summer of 1962, Cynthia discovered that she was pregnant with Lennon's child, so Lennon proposed marriage. When he told his aunt, she threatened never to speak to him again to stop him from going through with it. Lennon and Cynthia were married on 23 August, at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool, although Mimi did not attend. Lennon had wanted his half-sisters, cousins, and aunts to be there, but Mimi had contacted them beforehand and advised them against attending. After the Lennons had been living at Brian Epstein's flat for a few months (and after hearing about Cynthia's near-miscarriage), she offered to rent her downstairs back room to them. Before Christmas in 1972, she met the then-divorced Cynthia at the funeral of Mimi's sister, Harriet, in Liverpool. Mimi sternly criticised Cynthia for divorcing Lennon—and letting him start a relationship with Ono—by saying she should have stopped him from making ""an idiot of himself"". Even though Mimi was described as domineering, Ono later compared herself to her when describing her own relationship with Lennon. She later admitted that Ono was a good wife and mother. After Lennon's death, Ono and Sean Lennon visited Mimi in Liverpool, where she was staying at her sister Anne's house because of a heart condition. She said, ""Sean is like John in every way—looks and manner—and he has got John's sense of humour. As long as he keeps away from music, he will be all right"". Ono later bought 'Mendips' and donated it to The National Trust. It was renovated to make it look as it was in the 1950s when Lennon lived there, and Ono paid a visit before it was opened to the public. Lennon's cousin, Michael Cadwallader, had advised the National Trust on how the house looked when the Smiths lived there. Later years. Mimi had relatives in Eketahuna, New Zealand because her maternal aunt, Harriet Millward, had married and moved there. Mimi had exchanged letters with her relatives over the years, so Lennon arranged for a tour of New Zealand in 1964. Lennon's success caused problems for her and she was constantly pestered by fans at 'Mendips', so she sold the house for £6,000 in 1965; Lennon bought her a £25,000 bungalow by the beach called ""Harbour's Edge"" in Sandbanks, at 126 Panorama Road, Poole, Dorset, which was her home for the rest of her life. The Lennons and their son visited her there in the summer of 1965, which was the last time all three of them visited the house together. Lennon later gave his aunt his MBE medal, but later asked for it back so that he could return it in protest. Lennon gave Mimi an allowance of £30 per week, but when she found out that his wife's mother was being given the same amount, she phoned the Lennons' house and said, ""What has she mother done to deserve anything? Tell John, when you speak to him, that I am very, very annoyed"", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time. Death. Mimi died on 6 December 1991, at the age of 88, while being cared for at home by Lynne Varcoe, an auxiliary nurse. During the night, other carers were present. On the day of her death, Mimi collapsed in the bathroom, so Varcoe helped her to the bed, where Mimi started Cheyne-Stoking. According to Varcoe, her last words were, ""Hello, John"". Although the oldest of the Stanley girls, Mimi was the last of them to die. Cynthia, Sean and Ono attended her funeral on 12 December 1991: McCartney, Harrison, and Starr all sent floral arrangements. Despite the animosity between Cynthia and Mimi, Varcoe remembered Cynthia crying throughout the whole funeral, and said that Mimi had always spoken positively about her. Mimi was cremated at the Poole Crematorium and the reception was at the Harbour Heights Hotel. The whereabouts of her ashes is unknown. Ono put Mimi's house up for sale on the same day as the cremation, but it was demolished in 1994, so a four-bedroomed house could be built on the site. Portrayals on film. Mimi was portrayed on film in ""Birth of The Beatles"" (1979), ' (1985), ' (2000), and by actress Kristin Scott Thomas in ""Nowhere Boy"" (2010). McCartney disagreed with the director of ""Nowhere Boy"", Sam Taylor-Wood, about the original script portrayal of Mimi, saying: ""Aunt Mimi was not cruel. She was mock strict, but she was a good heart who loved John madly."" Taking McCartney's advice, Taylor-Wood agreed to change the script. "
wikipedia-350908," Kind Hearts and Coronets  Kind Hearts and Coronets is a 1949 British black comedy film starring Dennis Price, Alec Guinness (as eight members of the D'Ascoyne family), Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson. The plot is loosely based on the 1907 novel ""Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal"" by Roy Horniman, with the screenplay written by Robert Hamer and John Dighton and the film directed by Hamer. The film's title derives from Tennyson's 1842 poem ""Lady Clara Vere de Vere"": ""Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood."" ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" is listed in ""Time"" magazine's top 100 and the BFI Top 100 British films. In 2011, the film was digitally restored and re-released in selected British cinemas. Plot. In Edwardian England, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price), tenth Duke of Chalfont, writes his memoirs while in prison awaiting hanging the next morning. Most of the film consists of a flashback in which Louis narrates the events leading to his imprisonment. After his mother elopes with an Italian opera singer (also played by Price), she is disowned by her aristocratic family, the D'Ascoynes, for marrying beneath her. The couple are poor but happy, until he dies upon seeing his newborn son for the first time. As a boy, Louis' only friends are a local doctor's children: a girl named Sibella and her brother. When Louis becomes a young man, his mother writes to Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, a banker, for assistance in launching her son's career. Lord Ascoyne refuses to acknowledge their existence, and Louis is forced to accept employment as a draper's assistant. When Louis' mother dies, her last requestto be interred in the family vaultis denied. Louis vows to avenge her. After Sibella ridicules his offer of marriage, Louis attends her wedding to Lionel (John Penrose), a former schoolmate with a wealthy father. He then has a chance encounter at his workplace with one of those in line for the family title of Duke of Chalfont: Ascoyne D'Ascoyne (Alec Guinness in the first of eight roles as the D'Ascoynes). An altercation results in Louis' dismissal from his job in trade. Louis then decides to eliminate those who stand between him and the dukedom. After causing the deaths of Ascoyne D'Ascoyne and his mistress in a boating accident, Louis writes a letter of condolence to his victim's father, Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, who relents and employs him as a clerk in his private banking firm. Slowly becoming a man of means, Louis discreetly sees Sibella. He next decides to murder Henry D'Ascoyne, an amateur photographer, but is also charmed by Henry's wife, Edith (Valerie Hobson). After killing Henry with a darkroom explosion, Louis attends the funeral and views for the first time the remaining D'Ascoynes, including Ethelred, the current (eighth) duke. Louis poisons the Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne, then meets with a now-bankrupt Lionel, who begs for an extension of his loan. Noting he would prefer that ""someone else pay for Sibella's extravagances"", Louis agrees. He then pierces the hot air balloon from which suffragette Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets, remarking, ""I shot an arrow in the air. She fell to earth in Berkeley Square."" Boer Wars veteran General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne falls victim to an explosive gift of caviar, while Louis' quandary as to how to reach Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne is solved when he insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision. When Edith agrees to marry Louis, they notify Ethelred. Ethelred invites Louis to the family estate, where he informs Louis that he intends to marry to produce an heir. A now anxious Louis quickly arranges a shooting ""accident"", but before murdering Ethelred tells him the reason for doing so. Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, who has suffered a stroke, is spared Louis' attentions as he dies from the shock of learning that he has acceded to the dukedom, to Louis' somewhat relief. Louis becomes the tenth duke, but his triumph is short-lived. Lionel is found dead following Louis' rejecting his drunken plea for help to avoid bankruptcy. Louis is charged with his murder and tried by his peers in the House of Lords. Sibella perjures herself and incriminates him. Ironically, he is convicted of the one death of which he is innocent. Louis is visited in prison by Sibella, who hints she could exonerate him if he would dispose of Edith and marry her. Louis indicates agreement, and moments before his hanging Lionel's suicide note is conveniently produced. Upon his release, Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him. Pondering his dilemma, Louis quotes from ""The Beggar's Opera"": ""How happy could I be with either, Were t'other dear charmer away!"" When a representative of ""Tit-Bits"" magazine interrupts his reflections to ask for the publication rights to his memoirs, Louis suddenly realises he left his incriminating manuscript in his cell. American version. To satisfy the Hays Office Production Code, the film was censored for the American market. Ten seconds of footage was added to the ending, showing Louis' memoirs being discovered before he can retrieve them; which is implied in the original film in any case. The dialogue between Louis and Sibella was altered to downplay their adultery; derogatory lines about the Reverend were deleted; and in the nursery rhyme ""Eeny, meeny, miny, moe"", ""sailor"" replaced the word ""nigger"". The American version is six minutes shorter than the British original. Production. Guinness was originally offered only four D'Ascoyne parts, recollecting: ""I read screenplay on a beach in France, collapsed with laughter on the first page, and didn't even bother to get to the end of the script. I went straight back to the hotel and sent a telegram saying, ‘Why four parts? Why not eight!?'"" The exterior location used for Chalfont, the family home of the d'Ascoynes, is Leeds Castle in Kent, England. The interior was filmed at Ealing Studios. The village scenes in the film were actually filmed in the Kent village of Harrietsham. Leeds Castle became Chalfont, the family castle of the D'Ascoyne family. Reception. Bosley Crowther, critic for ""The New York Times"", calls it a ""delicious little satire on Edwardian manners and morals"" in which ""the sly and adroit Mr. Guinness plays eight Edwardian fuddy-duds with such devastating wit and variety that he naturally dominates the film."" Praise is also given to Price (""as able as Mr. Guinness in his single but most demanding role""), as well as Greenwood and Hobson (""provocative as women in his life""). Roger Ebert lists ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" among his ""Great Movies"", stating ""Price is impeccable as the murderer: Elegant, well-spoken, a student of demeanor"", and notes that ""murder, Louis demonstrates, ... can be most agreeably entertaining"". Novel. Reviewer Simon Heffer notes the plot of the original Roy Horniman novel was darker (e.g., the murder of a child) and differed in several respects. A major difference was that the main character was the half-Jewish (as opposed to half-Italian) Israel Rank, and Heffer noted that ""...his ruthless using of people (notably women) and his greedy pursuit of position all seem to conform to the stereotype that the anti-semite has of the Jew."" Historical source. The death of Admiral Horatio D'Ascoyne was inspired by a true event: the collision between HMS ""Victoria"" and HMS ""Camperdown"" off Tripoli because of an order given by Mediterranean Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon. The ""Victoria"" was sunk, losing over 300 men (including the admiral). Radio adaptations. The film has been adapted for radio, including a version produced on BBC Radio 4 featuring Robert Powell and Timothy Bateson (first broadcast in 1990), and another for BBC7 featuring Michael Kitchen as Mazzini and Harry Enfield as the D'Ascoyne family. On 19 May 2012, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a sequel to the film called ""Kind Hearts and Coronets – Like Father, Like Daughter"". In it, Unity Holland (played by Natalie Walter), the biological daughter of Louis and Sibella, is written out of the title by Lady Edith Gascoyne. Unity then murders the entire Gascoyne family, with all seven members played by Alistair McGowan. Digital restoration. The Criterion Collection released a two-disc set that featured both versions of the film. UK distributor Optimum Releasing released a digitally restored version for both DVD and Blu-ray on 5 September 2011. "
wikipedia-6426881," Holocaust victims  While the term Holocaust victims generally refers to Jews, the Nazis also persecuted and killed millions of members of other groups they considered inferior (""Untermenschen""), undesirable or dangerous. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) states: “The Holocaust was the murder of six million Jews and millions of others by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War II."" In addition to Jews, the targeted groups included Poles (of whom 2.5 million gentile Poles were killed) and some other Slavic peoples; Soviets (particularly prisoners of war); Romanies (also known as Gypsies) and others who did not belong to the ""Aryan race""; the mentally ill, the deaf, the physically disabled and mentally retarded; homosexual and transsexual people; political opponents such as social democrats and socialists; and religious dissidents, i.e. members of Jehovah's Witnesses. Taking into account all of the victims of Nazi persecution, they systematically killed an estimated six million Jews and mass murdered an additional eleven million people during the war. Donald Niewyk suggests that the broadest definition, including Soviet civilian deaths would produce a death toll of 17 million. Despite often widely varying treatment (some groups were actively targeted for genocide, while others were mostly not), these victims all perished alongside one another, some in concentration camps such as Dachau, some as victims of other forms of Nazi brutality, but most in death camps, such as Auschwitz, according to the extensive documentation left behind by the Nazis themselves (both written and photographed), eyewitness testimony (by survivors, perpetrators, and bystanders) and the statistical records of the various countries under occupation. Ethnic criteria. Jews. The paramilitary campaign to remove certain classes of persons, but above all Jews from Germany using methods of extreme brutality, is known as the Holocaust. The Holocaust was carried out primarily by German forces and certain collaborative persons, both German and otherwise. As the war started, millions of Jews were concentrated in ghettos. In 1941, of Jews took place; by December Hitler had decided to exterminate the European Jews. In all, more than 30% of the Jews in Europe were murdered in the Holocaust. The world's Jewish population was reduced by a third, from roughly 16.6 million in 1939 to about 11 million in 1946. Even sixty years later, there are still fewer Jews in the world today than there were prior to 1940. In January 1942, during the Wannsee conference, several Nazi leaders discussed the details of the ""Final Solution to the Jewish Question"" (""Endlösung der Judenfrage""). Dr. Josef Bühler, the State Secretary for the Central Government, urged Reinhard Heydrich, the conference chairman, to proceed with the Final Solution in the General Government. They began to systematically deport Jewish populations from the ghettos and all occupied territories to the seven camps designated as ""Vernichtungslager,"" or extermination camps at Birkenau, Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Maly Trostenets, Sobibór and Treblinka. The author Sebastian Haffner, published the analysis in 1978 that Hitler, from December 1941, accepted the failure of his goal to dominate Europe on his declaration of war against the United States, and that his withdrawal thereafter was sustained by the achievement of his second goal—the extermination of the Jews. Even as the Nazi war machine faltered in the last years of the war, precious military resources such as fuel, transport, munitions, soldiers and industrial resources were still being diverted away from the war towards the death camps. Poland, home of the largest Jewish community in the world before the war, had had over 90% of its Jewish population, or about 3,000,000 Jews, killed. The penalty imposed by the Germans for hiding Jews was death and this was carried out mercilessly. Some Poles hid Jews and saved their lives despite the risk to them and their own families. Although detailed reports on the Holocaust had reached western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of genocidal mass murder of Jews in Poland was extremely poor at the time; the first references in ""The New York Times"" in 1942 were not front-page news, these articles were more in the nature of 'unconfirmed' reports. Greece, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Lithuania, Bohemia, the Netherlands, Slovakia, and Latvia each had over 70% of their Jewish population destroyed. Belgium, Romania, Luxembourg, Norway, and Estonia lost around half of their Jews, the Soviet Union over one third; even countries such as France and Italy had each seen around a quarter of their Jewish population killed. Denmark was able to evacuate almost all of its Jews to nearby Sweden, which was neutral during the war. Using everything from fishing boats to private yachts, the Danes whisked their Jews out of harm's way. Some Jews outside Europe under Nazi occupation, were also affected by the Holocaust. Slavs. Slavs were one of the most widely persecuted ethnic groups, with many Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Serbs, Czechs, Sorbs, and others exterminated. Exceptions were drawn for Croats and Slovaks due to Germany's military alliances. Poles. The Nazi occupation of Poland was one of the most brutal episodes of the war, resulting in more than three million deaths, not including some three million Polish Jews. The six million Poles who were killed were Jewish, Roman Catholic and Orthodox. These deaths accounted for nearly 17% of the country's population. Poles were one of Hitler's first targets of extermination, as outlined in the speech he gave to Wehrmacht commanders before the invasion of Poland in 1939. The intelligentsia and socially prominent or influential people were primarily targeted, although mass murders were committed against the general Polish population, as well as against other groups of Slavs. Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles were sent to Auschwitz and the other concentration camps, the intelligentsia were the first targets of the ""Einsatzgruppen"" death squads. The anti-Polish campaign culminated in the near-complete destruction of the capital Warsaw, ordered by Hitler and Himmler in 1944. Soviet Slavs and POWs. During Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, millions of Red Army prisoners of war (POWs) were arbitrarily executed in the field by the invading German armies (in particular by the Waffen SS), died under inhuman conditions in German prisoner of war camps and during death marches, or were shipped to concentration camps for execution. The Germans killed an estimated 2.8 million Soviet POWs through starvation, exposure and summary execution, in a mere eight months over 1941 and 1942. According to the US Holocaust Museum, by the winter of 1941, ""starvation and disease resulted in mass death of unimaginable proportions"". Up to 500,000 were killed in the concentration camps. Soviet civilian populations in the occupied areas were also heavily persecuted (in addition to the barbarity of the Eastern Front frontline warfare manifesting itself in episodes such as the siege of Leningrad in which more than 1.2 million civilians died). Thousands of peasant villages across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were annihilated by German troops. During the occupation, Russia's Leningrad, Pskov and Novgorod region lost around a quarter of its population. Some estimate that as many as one quarter of all Soviet civilian deaths (five million Russian, three million Ukrainian and 1.5 million Belarusian) deaths at the hands of the Nazis and their allies were racially motivated. The Russian Academy of Science in 1995 reported civilian victims in the USSR, including Jews at German hands, totaled 13.7 million dead, 20% of the 68 million persons in the occupied USSR, including 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals; 2.2 million deaths of persons deported to Germany for forced labor; and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths in occupied territory. There were an additional estimated 3.0 million famine deaths in the territory not under German occupation. These losses are for the entire territory of the USSR in its 1946–1991 borders, including territories annexed in 1939–40. The deaths of 8.2 million Soviet civilians including Jews, were documented by the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission Romanies (Gypsies). The Nazi genocide of Gypsies was ignored by scholars until the 1980s, opinions continue to differ on its details. Some say that, proportional to their population, the death toll of Romanies (Roma (Romani subgroup), Sinti, and Manush) in the Holocaust was the largest of any group of victims. Others say that the genocide of these groups began later than the genocide of the Jews and that a smaller proportion was killed. Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Romani population of Europe involved a particularly bizarre application of Nazi ""racial hygiene"" (or a type of selective breeding). Despite discriminatory measures, some Romani groups, including some of the Sinti and Lalleri of Germany, were spared deportation and death, the remaining Romani groups suffered much like the Jews. Romanies were deported to the Jewish ghettos, shot by SS ""Einsatzgruppen"" in their villages or deported and gassed in Auschwitz and Treblinka. People with disabilities. Following a eugenics policy, the Nazis believed that the disabled were a burden to society because they needed to be cared for by others; they were also considered an affront to Nazi notions of a society peopled by a perfect, superhuman Aryan race. Around 375,000 individuals were sterilized against their will because of their disabilities. People with disabilities were also among the first to be killed by the Nazis; the United States Holocaust Memorial museum notes that the T-4 Euthanasia Program, established in 1939, became the ""model"" for future exterminations by the Nazi regime, and set a precedent for their attempted Jewish genocide. The T-4 Program was established in order to maintain the ""purity"" of the so-called Aryan race by systematically killing children and adults born with physical deformities or suffering from mental illness; this included use of the first gas chambers. Although Hitler formally ordered a halt to the T-4 program in late August 1941, the killings secretly continued until the war’s end, resulting in the murder of an estimated 275,000 people with disabilities. Non-Europeans. The Nazi regime promoted xenophobia of all ""non-Aryan"" races. African (black sub-Saharan or North African) and Asian (i.e. East Asian and South Asian) residents in Germany, and black prisoners of war (like the French colonial troops captured during the Battle of France), were also victims. Japan signed the Tripartite Pact on September 27, 1940, with Germany and Italy and was therefore part of the Axis Pact; no Japanese people were known to be deliberately imprisoned or killed. South Africans and white Europeans of non-Jewish ancestry from other continents were exempt, as were many Latin Americans of ""evident"" Germanic or ""Aryan"" ancestries, but not mestizos.  Homosexuals. Homosexuals were also targets of the Holocaust, as homosexuality was incompatible with Nazism because of their failure to reproduce the ""master race"". This was combined with the belief among the Nazis that homosexuality could be contagious. Initially homosexuality was discreetly tolerated while officially shunned. By 1936 Heinrich Himmler led an effort to persecute homosexuals under existing and new anti-homosexual laws. More than one million homosexual Germans were targeted, of whom at least 100,000 were arrested and 50,000 were serving prison terms as convicted homosexuals. An additional unknown number were institutionalized in state-run mental hospitals. Hundreds of European homosexual men living under Nazi occupation were castrated under court order. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexual men were imprisoned in concentration camps, but it is difficult to put an exact number on how many perished in them. According to Heinz Heger, an Austrian survivor, homosexual men ""suffered a higher mortality rate than other relatively small victim groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and political prisoners."" Male homosexuals in Nazi concentration camps were identified with a pink triangle on their shirts. Lesbians were not normally treated as harshly as homosexual men: they were labeled ""anti-social"", but were rarely imprisoned for engaging in homosexuality. Political criteria. Political prisoners. Another large group of the victims were various German and foreign civilian activists opposed to the Nazi regime from all over the political spectrum, as well as captured World War II resistance fighters (a great many of whom were executed during or immediately after their interrogation, especially in occupied Poland and France); sometimes also their families. German political prisoners were, for example, a substantial group among the first Dachau inmates, (the prototype Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court became infamous for the enormous number of death sentences handed down. Leftists. German communists were among the first people to be sent to concentration camps. They concerned Hitler due to their ties with the Soviet Union and because the Nazi Party was intractably opposed to communism. Rumours of pending communist violence were started by the Nazis as justification for the Enabling Act of 1933, the law which gave Hitler his original dictatorial powers. Hermann Göring later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that it was the Nazis' willingness to repress German communists that prompted Hindenburg and the old elite to cooperate with them. Hitler and the Nazis also hated German leftists because of their resistance to Nazi racism. Many leaders of German leftist groups were Jews who were especially prominent among the leaders of the Spartacist Uprising in 1919. Hitler referred to Marxism and ""Bolshevism"" as a means of ""the international Jew"" to undermine ""racial purity"" and survival of the Nordics or Aryans (sometimes of all white Europeans), as well as stirring up socioeconomic class tension and labor unions against the government or relevant businesses. Within concentration camps such as Buchenwald, German communists were privileged in comparison to Jews because of their ""racial purity."" Whenever the Nazis occupied a new territory, members of communist, socialist, or anarchist groups were thus normally among the first to be repressed, including summary executions. An example of this is Hitler's infamous Commissar Order in which he demanded the summary execution of all political commissars captured among Soviet soldiers. Freemasons. The Nazis claimed that high degree Masons were willing members of ""the Jewish conspiracy"" and that Freemasonry was one of the causes of Germany's defeat in WWI. The preserved records of the RSHA (""Reichssicherheitshauptamt"" – Office of the High Command of Security Service pursuing the racial objectives of the SS through Race and Resettlement Office), show the persecution of the Freemasons. The number of Freemasons from Nazi occupied countries who were killed is not accurately known, but it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 were murdered. Esperantists. Speakers of the international auxiliary language of Esperanto were regarded with suspiction by the Nazis. The language was considered by Hitler to be a language of the Jewish conspiracy due to the fact that its creator L. L. Zamenhof was Jewish. Enemy nationals. Thousands of people (mostly diplomats) belonging to certain nationalities associated with the Allies (e.g. Formosa Taiwan and Mexico), as well as Spanish Civil War refugees in occupied France, were also interned or executed. After Italy capitulated in 1943, many Italian nationals, including partisans and Italian soldiers disarmed by the Germans, were sent to concentration camps. Religious persecution. The Nazis also targeted some religious groups, for political and ideological reasons. Historian Detlef Garbe, director at the Neuengamme (Hamburg) Memorial, writing about Jehovah's Witnesses stated that ""no other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism with comparable unanimity and steadfastness."" Between 2,500 and 5,000 perished in the concentration camps. In addition, thousands of Christian clergy were killed by the Nazis, including some who had a Jewish background, as in the case of Edith Stein. In some countries Roman Catholic bishops and even Catholics themselves had openly protested and attacked Nazi policies. For instance, in the Netherlands and Poland, where bishops and priests had protested the deportation of Jews, the clergy was either threatened with deportation themselves and kept in custody (as in the case of German bishop Clemens von Galen), or directly deported to concentration camps (as in the cases of the Dutch Carmelite priest Titus Brandsma and Polish Fr. Maximilian Kolbe, who was later canonized). The Catholic Church was particularly suppressed in Poland: between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 members (18%) of the Polish clergy, were murdered; of these, 1,992 died in concentration camps. In the annexed territory of ""Reichsgau Wartheland"" it was even more harsh: churches were systematically closed and most priests were either killed, imprisoned, or deported to the General Government. Eighty per cent of the Catholic clergy and five bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939; 108 of them are regarded as blessed martyrs. Religious persecution was not confined to Poland: in Dachau concentration camp alone, 2,600 Catholic priests from 24 different countries were killed. Some dissenting German Protestant clergy, such as those who founded the anti-Nazi Confessing Church, were also persecuted. The Baha'i Faith, which teaches as its doctrine, the unity of humanity, was formally banned in the Third Reich. Others. The SS and police troops often unleashed mass actions against civilians with alleged links to resistance movements, their families, and even whole villages or districts of a city. In numerous cases resulting in wholesale slaughter of entire villages or towns, such as in the infamous cases of Lidice, Khatyn, Sant'Anna and Oradour-sur-Glane; one whole district of Warsaw was massacred). In occupied Poland, Nazi Germany formally imposed the death penalty on anybody found sheltering or helping Jews. ""Social deviants"" – prostitutes, vagrants, alcoholics, drug addicts, open dissidents, pacifists, draft resisters and common criminals – were also often imprisoned in concentration camps. The common criminals frequently became Kapos, the inmate-guards policing other prisoners. In the late 1930s, the Nazi program to punish many rich German persons as ""enemies of the state"" confiscated properties and placed thousands of them in concentration camps. According to Nazi policies formulated in part by Joseph Goebbels, the rich elite manipulated the German economy and held seditious liberal views. The Nazis had targeted other groups to be imprisoned for their political views deemed threatening by Hitler or the party; such as the members of women's rights groups who were accused of spouting ""communist-socialist"" dogmas of gender equality.  Some of the Germans and Austrians who had lived abroad for a significant proportion of their lives were also deemed to have too much exposure to foreign ideas, many were put into concentration camps. These prisoners were called ""Emigrants"" and marked with a blue triangle. "
wikipedia-7862936," StudiVZ  StudiVZ, SchülerVZ and MeinVZ is a social networking platform for students (in particular for college and university students in Europe) and is based in Berlin, Germany. The name is an abbreviation of the German expression ""Studentenverzeichnis"", which means ""students' directory"". The service is largely comparable to other social networking sites. StudiVZ claims to be one of the biggest social networks in Europe, with (reportedly) over 15 million members as of September 2009, mostly in the German-speaking countries of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. However, traffic to the site has entered a state of steady decline since late 2009. History. The network was launched in October 2005, inside a flat in Berlin by two students named Ehssan Dariani (CEO) and Dennis Bemmann and was financed by founding investor Lukasz Gadowski. Since then, they have also collected an undisclosed sum of investments by Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, the Samwer brothers (founders of the ringtone vendor Jamba!), and other sources. In fall 2006, similar services were launched in France (""StudiQG""), Italy (""StudiLN""), Spain (""EstudiLN"") and Poland (""StudentIX""). In February 2007, another version called SchülerVZ was launched, this time focused on secondary school students, with a reported membership around three million users. , VZ Networks claim a total userbase of over 16 million users. In February 2008, another version for non-students called meinVZ was launched. In January 2007, StudiVZ was sold to one of its investors, Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, for 85 million euros. After a massive decline in usage since late 2009, Holtzbrinck attempted to sell StudiVZ, but is not able to find any potential buyer. Features. StudiVZ provides several features for its members. Students are able to keep and maintain a personal page containing information about their name, age, study subjects, interests, courses and group memberships within StudiVZ. They have the option to upload photographs on their personal pages. Through the search function, former classmates, fellow students, learning partners or people with the same interests can be found. The latter are often organized in groups within StudiVZ. These groups have their own pages and a discussion forum open to group members. Additionally, StudiVZ provides a private messaging service for its members, including a birthday reminder for people on their friends list. Criticism. The most common criticism of the site is its strong similarity to Facebook. Dariani admits that his site is based on Facebook. There are some features that set the two sites apart, such as seeing who most recently visited the profile. Besides these additional features, the most notable difference is that features bear German instead of English names. For instance, the ""poke"" feature on Facebook has been renamed ""gruscheln"", usually interpreted as a portmanteau of the German verbs ""grüßen"" (to greet) and ""kuscheln"" (to cuddle).

wikipedia-772281," Muhammad Azam Shah  Abu'l Faaiz Qutb-ud-Din Muhammad Azam (28 June 1653 – 8 June 1707) commonly known as Azam Shah, was Emperor of the Mughal Empire and the eldest son of Emperor Aurangzeb and his Empress consort Dilras Banu Begum. He was also the grandson of the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Azam was anointed as the heir-apparent (""Shahi Ali Jah"") to his father, Emperor Aurangzeb, on 12 August 1681. He served as the Viceroy of Berar Subah, Malwa, Bengal and Gujarat. He ascended to the Mughal throne at Ahmednagar upon the death of his father on 14 March 1707 as the rightful heir to his father. Azam Shah and his two sons, Sultan Muhammad Bidar Bakht and Shahzada Wala Jah Bahadur, were later defeated and executed by Azam Shah's elder step-brother, Prince Shah Alam (later crowned Bahadur Shah I), during the Battle of Jajau on 8 June 1707. Early life. Muhammad Azam was born on 28 June 1653, in Burhanpur, to Prince Aurangzeb and his first wife and chief consort Dilras Banu Begum, who died four years after giving birth to him. His mother was the daughter of Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman Safavi (titled Shah Nawaz Khan) and was a princess of the prominent Safavid dynasty of Iran. Therefore, Azam was not only a Timurid from his father's side, but also had in him the royal blood of the Safavid dynasty, a fact which Azam was extremely proud of and after the death of his younger brother, Prince Muhammad Akbar, the only son of Aurangzeb who could boast of being of the purest blood. Azam's other half-brothers, Shah Alam (later Bahadur Shah I) and Kam Baksh being the sons of inferior and Hindu wives of Aurangzeb. According to Niccolao Manucci, the courtiers were very impressed by Azam's royal Persian ancestry and the fact that he was the grandson of Shah Nawaz Khan Safavi.  As Azam grew up, he was distinguished for his wisdom, excellence, and chivalrousness. His father, Aurangzeb, used to be extremely delighted with his son's noble character and excellent manners, and thought of him as his comrade. He often used to say ""Between this pair of matchless friends, a separation is imminent"". Azam's siblings included his elder sisters, the princesses: Zeb-un-Nissa, Zinat-un-Nissa, Zubdat-un-Nissa and his younger brother, Prince Muhammad Akbar. Marriage. Azam was at first betrothed to be married to his cousin, Iran Dukht Rahmat Banu (titled Bibi Pari), the beloved daughter of Shaista Khan, who was Aurangzeb's maternal uncle. However, the marriage did not take place due to Bibi Pari's sudden death in 1685 at Dacca. Later, Azam married his first cousin, Jahanzeb Banu Begum on 3 January 1669, she was the daughter of his eldest uncle Dara Shikoh and his aunt Nadira Banu Begum. Jahanzeb was his chief consort and his favourite wife, being greatly loved him. She gave birth to his eldest son on 4 August 1670. He was named 'Bidar Bakht' by his grandfather, Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb, throughout his life showed marks of exceptional love to these two and to their eldest son, Prince Bidar Bakht, a gallant, discreet and ever successful general, on all three of whom he used to constantly lavish gifts. Bidar Bakht was Aurangzeb's favourite grandson. In a marriage of political alliance, Azam later married his last wife, Shahar Banu Begum (titled Padshah Bibi) in 1681. She was a princess of the Adil Shahi dynasty and was the daughter of King Ali Adil Shah II, the ruler of Bijapur. Though Azam's love for Jahanzeb remain unchanged. For when she died in 1705, Azam was filled with great sorrow and despair which darkened the remainder of his life. History. Siege of Bijapur. In the year 1685 the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb dispatched his son Muhammad Azam Shah with a force of nearly 50,000 men to capture Bijapur Fort and defeat Sikandar Adil Shah the ruler of Bijapur who refused to be a vassal. The Mughals led by Muhammad Azam Shah could not make any advancements upon Bijapur Fort mainly due to the superior usage of cannon batteries on both sides. Outraged by the stalemate Aurangzeb himself arrived on September 4, 1686 and commanded the Siege of Bijapur after eight days of fighting the Mughals were victorious. Subahdar of Bengal. Prince Azam was appointed the Governor (""Subahdar"") of Berar Subah, Malwa and Bengal from 1678-1701 upon the death of his predecessor, Azam Khan Koka. He successfully captured the Kamarupa region in February 1679. He founded the incomplete Lalbagh Fort in Dhaka. During his administration, Mir Maula was appointed ""Diwan"" and Muluk Chand as ""Huzur-Navis"" for revenue collection. Prince Azam was recalled by Aurangzeb and left Dhaka on 6 October 1679. Berar Subah and Malwa were annexed by the plundering Marathas; Bengal went under administration of the Nawabs of Murshidabad. He later became the Governor (""Subahdar"") of Gujarat from 1701-1706. Accession. In third week of February 1707 in a bid to prevent a war of succession, Aurangzeb, separated Azam and his younger step-brother, Kam Baksh, whom Azam particularly loathed. He sent Azam to Malwa and Kam Baksh to Bijapur. A few days before his death he wrote farewell letters to Azam. The next morning, Azam who had tarried outside Ahmednagar instead of proceeding to Malwa, arrived at the imperial camp and conveyed his father's body for burial at his tomb at Daulatabad. Azam Shah proclaimed himself Emperor and seized the throne. In the political struggles following the disputed succession, he and his son Prince Bidar Bakht were defeated and killed on 8 June 1707 at the Battle of Jajau by his step-brother, Prince Muhammad Mu'azzam, who succeeded their father to the Mughal throne.

wikipedia-1781612," Third Avenue  Third Avenue is a north-south thoroughfare on the East Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan, running from Cooper Square north for over 120 blocks. The street leaves Manhattan and continues into The Bronx across the Harlem River over the Third Avenue Bridge north of East 129th Street to East Fordham Road at Fordham Center. It is one of the four streets that form The Hub, a site of both maximum traffic and architectural density, in the South Bronx. Third Avenue is two-way from Cooper Square to 24th Street, but since July 17, 1960. has carried only northbound (uptown) traffic while in Manhattan; in the Bronx, it is again two-way. However, the Third Avenue Bridge carries vehicular traffic in the opposite direction, allowing only southbound vehicular traffic, rendering the avenue essentially non-continuous to motor vehicles between the boroughs. The street was not always paved. In May 1861, according to a letter to the editor of ""The New York Times"", the street was the scene of practice marching for the poorly equipped troops in the 7th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment: ""The men were not in uniform, but very poorly dressed, — in many cases with flip-flap shoes. The business-like air with which they marched rapidly through the deep mud of the Third-avenue was the more remarkable."" Public transportation. Portions of Third Avenue are served by the following bus routes: In Manhattan: Southbound M101, M102, and M103 service operates on Lexington Avenue north of East 24th Street. In the Bronx: Third Avenue El. Third Avenue was the location of the Third Avenue Elevated line – which began operation in 1878 – until 1955 in Manhattan, and 1973 in the Bronx. The Bx55 replaced the Third Avenue Line in the Bronx in 1973. At the time the El was being torn down in Manhattan, there was a movement to rename Third Avenue ""The Bouwerie"", although it had never been part of The Bowery. References. Notes Bibliography "
wikipedia-2641066," Aura Noir  Aura Noir is a Norwegian black metal band from Oslo, Norway. Aura Noir is heavily influenced by early thrash bands such as Slayer, Sodom and Kreator, to the latter they have also dedicated some of their songs. The band's main lyrical themes focus on blasphemy, death, and aggression. History. The band was formed in 1993 by Aggressor (Carl-Michael Eide) and Apollyon (Ole Jørgen Moe), who sent out a couple of demos before releasing the underground EP ""Dreams Like Deserts"" in 1995. In 1996, they were joined by Mayhem guitarist Blasphemer (Rune Eriksen), who contributed to the release of ""Black Thrash Attack"", their first full-length CD.  In 2004, they were the first band to be signed to Tyrant Syndicate Productions, a sub-label of Peaceville Records, run by Nocturno Culto and Fenriz (both of Darkthrone). They released their next album ""The Merciless"", which featured Nattefrost of Carpathian Forest and Fenriz on guest vocals. The band was put on hold after Aggressor was in an accident in late March, 2005. It is alleged that he either jumped or fell out from a fourth floor window, and landed on his legs after falling ten metres. In May 2006, Aggressor appeared as a guest in the Norwegian radio programme Tinitus, where he confirmed he uses a wheelchair due to being paralyzed from the ankles down.  Despite this setback, the band continued to record new material, which resulted in a new full-length album, ""Hades Rise"", being released on August 25, 2008, and, as of 2010, has played several live gigs with a replacement drummer. At their 2011 gigs at Inferno and at the Party.San festival in Germany, Aggressor, still on crutches, joined them as the vocalist for several songs. "
wikipedia-74043," Captain Hook  Captain James Hook (James is sometimes shortened to Jas) is a fictional character: the antagonist of J. M. Barrie's play ""Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up"" and its various adaptations. The character is a pirate captain of the brig ""Jolly Roger"", and lord of the pirate village/harbour in Neverland. Most importantly, he is the archenemy of Peter Pan, described as ""boatswain to Blackbeard"", and ""the man that frightened Barbecue"". His two principal fears are the sight of his own blood (which is supposedly an unnatural colour) and one fateful crocodile. His name plays on the iron hook replacing his right hand, cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by a saltwater crocodile, who thereafter pursues Hook in hope of preying on him further. Creation of the character. Hook did not appear in early drafts of the play, whereof the capricious and coercive Peter Pan was closest to a ""villain""; but was created for a front-cloth scene depicting the children's journey home. Later, Barrie expanded the scene, on premise that children were fascinated by pirates, and expanded the role of the captain as the play developed. The character was originally cast to be played by Dorothea Baird, the actress playing Mary Darling; but Gerald du Maurier, already playing George Darling (and the brother of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies), persuaded Barrie to let him take the additional role instead, a casting decision since replicated in many stage and film productions of the ""Peter Pan"" story. Biography of the character. Barrie states in the novel that ""Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze"", and relates that Peter Pan began their rivalry by feeding the pirate's hand to the crocodile. It is implied that he attended Eton College and Balliol in the play; Hook's final words are ""Floreat Etona"", the College's motto. Barrie confirmed this in a 1927 speech entitled ""Captain Hook at Eton"". In Barrie's novel, Hook captures Wendy Darling, whom Peter views as his surrogate mother, and challenges the boy to a duel. When Hook is beaten, Peter Pan kicks him overboard to the open jaws of the crocodile, which Hook criticizes, in falling, as ""bad form"". Peter quickly finds a new opponent; but as Hook made a stronger impression on the public, most sequels brought him back by various means. Appearance. In the novel ""Peter and Wendy"", Hook is described as ""cadaverous"" and ""blackavized"", having blue eyes and long dark curls resembling ""black candles. In most pantomime performances of ""Peter Pan"", and in the film ""Hook"", Hook's hair is a wig, and is accompanied by thick bushy eyebrows and mustache. The eponymous hook takes place of his right hand (often changed to his left hand in film adaptations) and is used as a weapon. He is also described as having a ""handsome countenance"" and an ""elegance of [...] diction"" – ""even when he swearing"". Captain Hook is often portrayed wearing a large feathered hat; a red, black or blue coat; and knee breeches, after the novel's description that ""In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II"". Hook is often seen with a cigar holder that lets him smoke two cigars at once. Barrie also said of him in ""Captain Hook at Eton"" as, ""In a word, the handsomest man I have ever seen, though, at the same time, perhaps slightly disgusting""; tangent to which, that although Hook is callous and bloodthirsty, Barrie makes it clear that these qualities make him a magnificent pirate and ""not wholly unheroic"". ""Peter Pan in Scarlet"". Geraldine McCaughrean's authorized sequel to ""Peter Pan"" introduces Ravello, a circus man in a ragged woollen coat, constantly unravelling, who offers to be Peter's valet but whose influence changes Peter Pan into a reincarnation of Captain Hook, and who is identified as the former Hook, resurrected from the crocodile's intestines. One of Ravello's trophies is an Eton trophy dated 1894. If Hook was 18 - the last year of an Etonian — in that year, he was born in 1876, a full 101 years after his appearance at the 'Pirates' Conference' below, and even later after Blackbeard and Long John Silver. Hook in this book denies the association with Blackbeard. Only upon receiving Wendy's kiss, and five weeks' worth of sleep, does the real James Hook reveal himself. ""Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth"". According to the (non-canon) novel ""Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth"", Captain Hook was the illegitimate son of a nobleman, ""Lord B"", and an unnamed woman Hook has never met (implied to be the Queen). Denounced by Lord B., James Matthew is reared by a Shakespearean actress he calls Aunt Emily, and unwillingly attends Eton College as an Oppidan scholar, where he is an avid reader of Shakespeare and Shelley, and his motto is ""Knowledge is Power"". He describes many things as first rate - ""Topping Swank"", and he punctuates his sentences with ""The End"". He is very interested in the French Revolution. In this novel James has only a few friends including Roger Peter Davies, whom he nicknames ""Jolly Roger"" (the name of his ship in later life), and the spider 'Electra'; but rivals Arthur Darling, a seventeen-year-old Colleger, in studies, fencing, sports, and the attentions of the visiting Ottoman Sultana Ananova Ariadne. When James successfully woos Ananova, their affection sets off political outrage that affects the noble position of Lord B., who arranges for James to leave Eton on his trading ship, the ""Sea Witch"". Upon leaving, James defeats Arthur in a final duel and burns his own school records to leave no traces of his behaviour. On the ""Sea Witch"", he befriends boatswain Bartholomew Quigley Smeethington, generally called Smee; frees the slaves aboard ship; overthrows the ship's captain (killed by Electra); and murders the quartermaster with a metal hook. Throughout ""Capt. Hook"", author J.V. Hart relates events in James Matthew Barrie's life and the lives of the Llewellyn-Davies children, even naming James's arch-enemy after the Llewellyn-Davies' father. The narrative expands upon details of Barrie's original play and novel, but ascribes James's unusual colouring and yellow blood to a blood disorder; makes James's long dark hair natural, rather than the usual wig; and has James titled ""Hook"" after murdering the quartermaster of the ""Sea Witch"", rather than in reference to his prosthetic hand. ""Peter and the Starcatchers"". In the novel ""Peter and the Starcatchers"" by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, Captain Hook is distinguished by halitosis, beady black eyes, a pock-marked face, and perpetual filth of his person and surroundings (this image contrasts strongly with J. M. Barrie's Etonian gentleman). In ""Peter and the Starcatchers"", which takes place before the captain meets Peter Pan, Hook is called ""Black Stache"" for his prominent moustache (a reference, possibly, to Blackbeard, and his initial ship is called the ""Sea Devil"", whereas the ""Jolly Roger"" is a captured a British ship, originally the ""Wasp"". Black Stache is renamed 'Captain Hook' in the second installment, ""Peter and the Shadow Thieves"". Which hand is severed differs: in Barrie's original novel, his right hand was ""purposely"" cut off by Peter; whereas In Barry and Pearson's adaptation, his left hand was ""accidentally"" cut off by Peter, which would make their story non-canon to Barrie's original. ""Peter and the Starcatcher"" (Play). In Rick Ellis' theatrical adaptation of the Berry-Pearson novel, Black Stache (portrayed in the original production by Christian Borle who won a Tony Award for the role) is a witty, poetical, but psychotic pirate prone to malapropisms and the occasional pratfall. Similar to the Disney film character, Black Stache resembles both a dangerous villain and a comic buffoon. The last of a line of villains, he seeks to become a great villain by fighting a great hero, and finds one in Peter. His hand is cut off not by Peter, but accidentally severed when he slams the lid of a trunk in a fit of a rage. Disney. The version of Captain Hook who appears in the Disney animated film adaptation of ""Peter Pan"" is somewhat of a comic relief character; in early development, the story department wrote their analysis of Hook's character: ""He is a fop...Yet very mean, to the point of being murderous. This combination of traits should cause plenty of amusement whenever he talks or acts"". Frank Thomas was the directing animator of Hook. According to Disney's Platinum release bonus features, Hook was modeled after a Spanish King. One director insisted that Hook should be a darker villain with no comedic traits; but this was refused for fear of frightening a juvenile audience, and Hook became a comical villain, equally matched with Peter Pan. Like subsequent Disney villains, Hook is a far more cowardly character than his original counterpart: he is seen as a spoiled little boy with a childish, infantile temper. Mr. Smee is almost a parent figure to Hook; he panders and caters to his every whim, agreeing with everything he says and does. Actor Hans Conried set the tone for Disney's interpretation of Hook, as he was the original voice for the Captain, as well as, in the tradition of the stage play, Mr. Darling, and performed live-action reference for the two characters. In modern animation, Hook is voiced by Corey Burton. Appearances. In the animated film, Hook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his hand, and refuses to leave Neverland prior to this revenge. Throughout the film, Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising Tinker Bell 'not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan', he lays a bomb in Peter's hideout (representing Barrie's vial of poison). At the conclusion of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance. Walt Disney insisted on keeping Hook alive, as he said: ""The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don't want to see him killed."" In the sequel ""Return to Never Land"", Hook mistakes Wendy's daughter Jane for Wendy, and uses her as bait to lure Peter Pan to his death. After this fails, he promises to take Jane home if she will help him find the island's treasure, and promises Jane, ""Not to harm a single hair on Peter Pan's head""; this fulfilled when he pulls a single hair from Peter's head, declaring ""The rest of him is mine"". In the end of the film, he and the crew are pursued into the distance by a giant octopus. He stars in the Disney Interactive computer game, ""Disney's Villains' Revenge"", wherein the player defeats Hook and returns Peter to his rightful age. Hook also appeared frequently on ""Disney's House of Mouse"", and was one of the main villains of ""Mickey's House of Villains"". He also appeared in """" and made a special guest cameo on ""Raw Toonage"" in the episode hosted by Don Karnage of ""TaleSpin"", wherein he challenged Karnage to a swordfight for a treasure chest and won. In the Disney Junior series ""Jake and the Never Land Pirates"", Hook serves as the series antagonist. Hook's origins are set to be explored in the upcoming Disney Fairies film ""Tinker Bell and the Pirate Fairy"", where as a cabin boy only known as James, he befriends the fairy Zarina only to eventually betray her. Here he is voiced by Tom Hiddleston. Occasionally, Hook appears in the Scrooge McDuck universe of comic books as the nemesis of Moby Duck, a whaler cousin of Donald Duck. Kingdom Hearts. He takes Riku along with him, where Kairi is being held. Hook does not like Riku's bossiness and regrets taking him along; nonetheless, he follows his orders, as Riku now has control over the Heartless and would most likely unleash them on him should he disobey. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy arrive in Neverland, Riku throws them in the hold where they meet and escape with Peter Pan, who is searching for his friend Wendy. Captain Hook believed that Wendy was a ""Princess of Heart"" and that is why he captured her. However, Riku reports to him from Maleficent that Wendy is not a Princess of heart at all, irritating Hook (he hints that kidnapping Wendy was a very difficult task). After defeating the Heartless below deck, Sora fights a copy of himself summoned by Riku in Hook's office. After confronting Hook on the deck, learning that Riku took Kairi to Hollow Bastion, Sora and company are forced to surrender when Hook uses Tinker Bell as a hostage. When the crocodile appears, Hook flees to his office while telling Smee to have their prisoners walk the plank. However, Peter Pan returns to save Sora before using his Smee imitation to trick Hook out to the deck, resulting in the villain being thrown overboard and chased into the horizon by the crocodile. He later reappears in ""Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days"", finding a large amount of treasure maps all leading to boxes that are actually set to release Heartless once Hook opens the chest (unknown to Hook and Smee, however, is that these chests were set up to help build Pete's Heartless army). In """" he appears as a figment of Sora's memories and is absent in ""Kingdom Hearts II"". Hook later appears in the game series prequel, ""Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep"", where he tricks Terra into attempting to kill Peter Pan for him. He later kidnaps Tinker Bell and takes Mickey Mouse's star fragment, but is defeated by Ventus and thrown into the water, where the crocodile chases him off. His Japanese voice actor was Chikao Ōhtsuka up until ""Birth by Sleep"", where Chikao Ōhtsuka was cast as Master Xehanort and Hook thus voiced by Naoya Uchida. His English voice actor is Corey Burton. ""Epic Mickey"". Captain Hook is also featured prominently in the Wii game, ""Epic Mickey"", wherein he has been converted into an animatronic, cyborg version of himself (referred to in the game as a Beetleworx) and is waging an attack against the non-converted pirates. Smee, requests that Mickey Mouse find a way to save Hook. Players can either fight Hook by themselves and earn a thinner upgrade (and a ""bad ending""), or free the Sprite and have Peter Pan (played by Pete) defeat him and earn a paint upgrade (and a ""good ending"" showing Peter Pan and Captain Hook in a duel). In """", Hook has disappeared entirely, leaving his crew leaderless and having been run out of Tortooga by Blackbeard and Pete Pan having joined up with the Mad Doctor after losing his purpose. Some of Hook's clothes and items have been left behind in Ventureland, which the crew members seek to assert their authority to take over leadership of the other pirates and lead them to take back their home. The Cartoon World's version of Hook appears in """" as the first boss, having fallen under the control of Mizrabel to fight Mickey. Upon his defeat, he comes to his senses and offers his help to Mickey's quest to bring the toons back to the Cartoon World. Live events. Captain Hook also appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character, as well as part of the dark ride Peter Pan's Flight. In Fantasmic! at Disneyland, there is a scene in which we see Captain Hook and Peter Pan duelling aboard the Jolly Roger (portrayed by the Sailing Ship Columbia). This is replaced by a short re-enactment of Disney's Pocahontas at Disney's Hollywood Studios. At Disney World's Dream-Along with Mickey show, Hook, along with Smee, is one of the villains that crashes Mickey's party. This happens when Peter and Wendy appear to make Goofy's dream for some adventure come true and play a game of ""Pretend to Be Pirates"" with Donald Duck, who pretends to be the captain until the real Hook appears and challenges Peter to a duel. At first, Hook's appearance seems to take place for no reason other than to add some action to the show, but is revealed to actually be working for Maleficent, who is insulted after not being invited to the party. He is defeated by Mickey Mouse, who leads the audience in a chant of ""Dreams come true!"", and scares off the villains. At the Disney Villains Mix and Mingle Halloween Dance Party at Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, Hook is summoned up by Maleficent along with the other villains, and co-hosts along with her, revealed by him being the only one of the villains beside her to sing and also being the villain that dances with her. Captain Hook was also featured in the Disney on Ice 2013 show 'Let's Party' as part of the Halloween celebration section, which takes the format of a party hosted by Jack Skellington where all the 'main' Disney villains attend (Evil Queen and Jafar being two other notable villains in the scene) and they plan to capture Mickey Mouse to plunge everyone into unhappiness. Other appearances. ""Peter Pan"" (1954 musical). Most notably, Cyril Ritchard played Captain Hook in the 1954 musical adaptation which starred Mary Martin as Peter Pan. George Rose played the role in the 1977 revival which featured Sandy Duncan as Pan. Four years earlier, Boris Karloff starred as Mr. Darling/Captain Hook in a different musical treatment of the story, with songs by Leonard Bernstein. In that version, Jean Arthur played Peter. ""Peter Pan — The Animated Series (no boken)"". In 1989, the Japanese Nippon Animation produced 41 episodes of ""Peter Pan - the Animated Series""; this was aired on World Masterpiece Theater and in several other countries. Hook's personality was far closer to the original character from Barrie's novel; and beside his first objective to destroy Peter Pan, he also is eager to become Neverland's first king. Hook also had a second hook-hand that both looked and functioned in a similar fashion as a crab claw. He was voiced in the Japanese version by Chikao Ōhtsuka, who also portrayed the Disney incarnation of the character in Japanese media, particularly in Kingdom Hearts and . ""Peter Pan and the Pirates"". In 1990, Fox produced the television series ""Peter Pan and the Pirates"", wherein Hook's costume was more early 18th century rather than the classic Charles II-Restoration period. He also had white hair, rather than black, and wore black clothes, rather than red. Most of all, he was clean shaven, rather than sporting a signature moustache. Hook's personality is far closer to Barrie's original character; he terrifies his crew, brutalizes his enemies, has no fear (except of the crocodile), shows great intelligence, and is passionate about plays by William Shakespeare. He was voiced by Tim Curry, who won an Emmy for this part. Although the original Hook is associated with Blackbeard, this version was the Midshipman of his own elder brother, who commanded a frigate called the ""Rake"". Originally engaged to a young woman, one Christmas Day raid sees the Hook brothers (Hook's name in this account is given as ""James Hook"") capture a ship transporting Hook's fiancee, Cecilia. Also on a Christmas Day, the two brothers fight a duel in which James leaves the ship after gouging out his brother's eye, thus earning him the title ""Captain Patch"". While Hook eventually finds his way to Neverland, and thus a form of immortality, Patch perishes, his treasure eventually appearing in Neverland. One episode involves Hook finding the treasure, and unwittingly awakening the malevolent ghost of his elder brother. ""Hook"" (1991 Film). In the film ""Hook"", Captain James Hook is played by Dustin Hoffman. Hook kidnaps the children of a now adult Peter to lure his arch-enemy back to Neverland after several years away, and negotiates with Tinker Bell to permit the out-of-shape Peter three days to rekindle his spirit. Hook is somewhat depressed since Peter Pan, now named Peter Banning (played by Robin Williams), has left Neverland, and worries he has nothing left to accomplish, having killed the crocodile and made it into a clock tower, at the center of his pirate settlement; but remains terrified of a clock's ticking. As the story progresses and with Smee's suggestion, Hook attempts to persuade Peter's children that their father never loved them as an attempt to keep them in Neverland permanently. He is successful with Peter's son, Jack, who soon sees him as a father figure and he is often frustrated with his father's callous behavior. Whereas, Peter's daughter, Maggie, mistrusted Hook and retains faith in her father in spite of his broken promises. Realizing she has seen past him and still believes in Peter, Hook continues holding Maggie hostage until she loses faith in her father. Rufio valiantly fights Hook in a sword fight and is fatally stabbed by him. Having seen him die, Jack turns against Hook and renews his trust for Peter by leaving the life of a pirate behind. Peter and Hook engage in a final duel amid a circle of Lost Boys, wherein Hook is apparently ""eaten"" by the crocodile-tower. In the film, Hook's hook is on his left hand due to Hoffman being right-handed, and has other attachments including a goblet and a pointer. He dresses very elegantly with a gold-trimmed red coat, matching hat, and a wig that hides his balding head. He keeps a ceremonial captain's sword at his side, but uses a proper dueling sword when fighting Rufio and Peter. Hook's physical appearance in the film is heavily influenced by Disney's portrayal, though with greater embellishments of gold and silk on his clothes, and curled ends to his moustache; but he is closer to the characterization in Barrie's novel as 'gentleman pirate'. He also seems able to travel to and from Neverland upon the ""Jolly Roger"" (later re-created in Disney's ""Return to Neverland""). ""Peter Pan"" (2003 film). In the 2003 film adaptation of ""Peter Pan"", Captain James Hook is portrayed by British actor Jason Isaacs. Isaacs also plays the role of George Darling, Wendy's father, following a custom of the original play. In this version, Jason Isaacs has the hook on his right hand and requires a shoulder harness, presumably to help regulate the weight Hook feels using it. Hook in this film is feared and ruthless, but also of a gentleman-like nature. In the climactic duel, Hook learns to fly, thus almost defeating Peter; but the taunts of the Lost Boys negate the necessary enthusiasm, whereupon he falls purposely into the crocodile's mouth. Sergio Bonelli Editore comic books. In the Italian comic books published by Sergio Bonelli Editore, Captain Hook appears in at least two different versions. In Martin Mystère comic book, Neverland is located in the heart of London, the Lost Boys are late 18th-century British students influenced by the French Revolution, and Captain Hook is a 18th-century pirate who rules Neverland with an iron fist. In Dylan Dog comic book, Captain Hook's biography is the same as in J. M. Barrie's story, but he left Neverland after his defeat on the hands of Peter Pan. He came to the modern late 20th century world where he became a successful businessman. Pirates of the Caribbean. In A. C. Crispin's 2011 novel ', Captain Hook appears in a conversation between Captain Teague and Pirate Lord Don Rafael: ""You'll never guess who I encountered at Oporto a few months ago. [...] James. [...] He's lost a hand. [...]he said it wasn't so bad, the hook was as good as a dagger in a fight. [...] He didn't look a day older, not a day. [...] James was a lot more...subdued. [...] The taberna keeper's little lad came round to collect our plates, and when he turned and saw he, for just a second he looked--scared. No, worse than that. Terrified. [...] Can you imagine that? Afraid! Of a young boy!"" One of the early concept arts for ' showed a pirate similar to Captain Hook as one of the Pirate Lords of the Fourth Brethren Court. Shrek film series. Captain Hook is a minor character in the film ""Shrek 2"", playing ""Little Drop of Poison"" by Tom Waits and ""People Just Ain't No Good"" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on the piano in the ""Poisoned Apple"" tavern. In ""Shrek the Third"", he has a greater role as a secondary villain and is voiced by Ian McShane. ""Neverland"" (TV Miniseries). In the TV miniseries ""Neverland"", James Hook is played by Rhys Ifans. He is introduced as ""Jimmy"", a fencing teacher and leader of a small group of pickpocketing children, whereof Peter Pan is one. Jimmy is after a mysterious orb, which Peter and his gang steal unknown to Jimmy, and which transmits Jimmy and all the boys, except Peter, to Neverland. Jimmy and the boys (except for one called Fox) are then captured by pirates to be questioned by Elizabeth Bonny, captain of the ""Jolly Roger"". Believing Jimmy useful to herself, Bonny befriends (and later seduces) Jimmy, who reveals his name is James Hook; whereafter Bonny informs Jimmy of her desire to control the fairy dust. Jimmy offers his services to Bonny in exchange for the boys' safety. Having arrived on Neverland, Peter and Fox attempt to rescue the other boys from the pirates; but in the ensuing battle, Fox is killed by the pirate Starkey. Jimmy, Bonny, and a few pirates follow Peter, Tinker Bell, and Tiger Lily to a hidden city, where Robert Fludd identifies Neverland as a planet at the center of the Universe, accessible by means of the afore-said orb. Jimmy then reveals his unrequited admiration of Peter's dead mother, and a pocket watch belonging to Peter's father. In service to Bonny, Jimmy searches for the fairy dust, to which purpose he tricks Peter into showing him the fairies' location, where Bonny fails to control them and dies. Jimmy, in a rage, reveals that he killed Peter's father and attempts to leave the island; prompting a duel in which Peter severs Jimmy's right hand, which falls into the water and is eaten by a crocodile. Jimmy throws the pocket watch at Peter; but it misses and is eaten by the same crocodile. ""Once Upon a Time"". During the TV series ""Once Upon a Time"" Captain Hook made his first appearance in the episode ""The Crocodile"" played by Colin O'Donoghue, wherein Hook is a young pirate captain named Killian Jones. The ""crocodile"" that takes his hand is Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) whom Hook likens to a crocodile and who later sought revenge on the pirate for enticing his wife from him. In later appearances, Hook allies himself alternately with various of the story's heroes and villains, according to immediate mutual need; and frequently betrays or abandons his current allies. 2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony. Alongside other inflatable villains such as Lord Voldemort, the Queen of Hearts, Cruella de Vil, and The Child Catcher, Captain Hook made an appearance during the opening ceremony of the XXX Olympiad in London, representing one of the villains of British children's literature.

wikipedia-3672992," Rod Martin  Rod Martin (born April 7, 1954 in Welch, West Virginia) is a retired National Football League linebacker who played for the Los Angeles and Oakland Raiders from 1977 to 1988. College career. Before his NFL career, Martin played college football at the University of Southern California where he was a 1976 All-Pac-10 graduate. Prior to USC, Martin played at Los Angeles City College. High school career. Martin went to Hamilton High School, the same high school NFL Hall of Famer Warren Moon attended. Professional career. Martin was one of the top linebackers in the NFL during his 12 seasons and made the Pro Bowl twice during his career, in 1983 and 1984. Drafted in the 12th round, Martin was initially a 210 lb tweener, undersized for a LB and slow for a S, but eventually bulked up to 220-225. In 1978, his second year, Martin started 8 games, filling in at ILB. By 1979 he settled in at the weak-side LB spot, becoming a mainstay on the Raider defense, assisting the Silver&Black to 2 Super Bowl victories (1980, 1983) and having an outstanding performance in each one. In Super Bowl XV, Martin recorded a Super Bowl record 3 interceptions from Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski, and returned them for 44 yards. His 3 interceptions were not only a Super Bowl record, but they also tied linebacker Chuck Howley's record for career Super Bowl interceptions (later defensive back Larry Brown tied this record as well). Among these players, Martin is the only one to record all 3 of his interceptions in one game. In Super Bowl XVIII, Martin broke up a third down pass on his own 7-yard line in the second quarter, a sack of Joe Theismann, tackled Washington Redskins hall of fame running back John Riggins for no gain on a fourth down and one conversion attempt deep in Raiders territory on the last play of the third quarter, and recovered a fumble in the final period.。 In his 12 NFL seasons, Martin recorded 14 interceptions, which he returned for 225 yards and 4 touchdowns, along with 10 fumble recoveries, which he returned for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also recorded 33 and a half official sacks (sacks were not an official statistic until 1982, Martin's 5th season). Personal. Martin has returned to work at USC, where he is a programmer and manager of technical and user support services in the Information Sciences Institute. Martin and his wife Regina have 2 daughters, Jessica who played volleyball at Bethune-Cookman University and Jade a softball player who attended Morgan State University. "
wikipedia-1274922," Seed saving  In agriculture and gardening, seed saving (sometimes known as brownbagging) is the practice of saving seeds or other reproductive material (e.g. tubers) from vegetables, grain, herbs, and flowers for use from year to year for annuals and nuts, tree fruits, and berries for perennials and trees. This is the traditional way farms and gardens were maintained. In recent decades, there has been a major shift to purchasing seed annually from commercial seed suppliers, and to hybridize or clone plants that do not produce seed that remains ""true to type""-retaining the parent's characteristics- from seed. Much of the grassroots seed-saving activity today is the work of home gardeners. However, it is gaining popularity among organic farmers, permaculturists and enthusiasts with cultural or environmentalist interests. Open Pollination. Open pollination is an important aspect of seed saving. Plants that reproduce through natural means tend to adapt to local conditions over time, and evolve as reliable performers, particularly in their localities, known as landraces or ""folk varieties.""The modern trend to rely on hybridized and cloned plants negates these evolutionary processes. Hybrid plants are artificially cross-pollinated, and bred to favor desirable characteristics, like higher yield (in monocultures) and more uniform size to accommodate mechanized harvesting. However, the seed produced by the second generation (F2) of the hybrid does not reliably produce a true copy of that hybrid (it 'segregates') and often loses much of its yield potential.  Loss of species. While comprehensive figures are hard to come by, one popular view today holds that thousands of varieties of vegetables and flowers are being lost, due to reliance on commercial hybrid seed. Widespread use of a relatively few mass-marketed hybrid seed varieties, in both home gardening and commercial farming, is said to be eliminating many open-pollinated varieties, especially the local variations that were naturally developed, when local seed-saving was the common practice. The concern is that this erodes the gene pool, resulting in less hardy, more vulnerable plants. Countering this trend (an environmental and sustainability issue), and an affinity for variety and tradition, are the principal motivations for many large seed-saving groups. Method. To be successful at seed saving, new skills need to be developed that enhance the capacity of growers to ensure that desired characteristics are retained in their landraces: learning the minimum number of plants to be grown which will preserve inherent genetic diversity, recognizing the preferred characteristics of the cultivar being grown so that plants that are not breeding true are selected against, understanding and promoting the breeding of improvements to the cultivar, using seed storage methods that maintain viability, learning the conditions that maximize germination, and detecting the presence of diseases that are seed-borne so that they can be eliminated. Care must be taken, as training materials regarding seed production, cleaning, storage, and maintenance often focus on making landraces more uniform, distinct and stable (usually for commercial application) which can result in the loss of valuable adaptive traits unique to local varieties (Jarvis et al., 2000). Additionally, there is a matter of localized nature to be considered. In the upper northern hemisphere, and lower southern, one sees a seasonal change in terms of a cooler winter. Many plants go-to-seed and then go dormant. These seeds must hibernate until their respective spring season. Legality. While saving seed and even exchanging seed with other farmers for biodiversity purposes has been a traditional practice, these practices have become illegal for the plant varieties that are patented or otherwise owned by some entity (often a corporation). Under Article 28 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement), ""planting, harvesting, saving, re-planting, and exchanging seeds of patented plants, or of plants containing patented cells and genes, constitutes use"" and is prohibited by the intellectual property laws of signatory states. Significantly, farmers in developing countries are particularly affected by prohibitions on seed saving. There are some protections for re-use, called ""farmer's privilege"", in the 1991 International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention), but seed exchange remains prohibited. In the United States, by contrast, the farmer's privilege is considered protected by the Plant Variety Protection Act and by case law stemming from ""Asgrow Seed v. Winterboer"". American farmers may sell seed up to the amount saved for replanting their own acreage. ""Diamond v. Chakrabarty"" established that companies may obtain patents for life-forms. ""J.E.M. Ag Supply v. Pioneer"" established that seed saving is a patent violation. References. Jarvis, D., B. Sthapit, and L. Sears (eds.). 2000.

wikipedia-1030462," Carlinhos Brown  Carlinhos Brown (born Antonio Carlos Santos de Freitas, November 23, 1962) is an Oscar-nominated Brazilian musician, songwriter and record producer from Salvador, Bahia. His musical style blends Tropicália, reggae, and traditional Brazilian percussion. He has also been nominated for an Academy Award for his musical contributions in ""Rio"". He founded Timbalada and Tribalistas, and is also a solo artist. Early life. He was born in Candeal Pequeno, a small neighbourhood in the Brotas area of Salvador de Bahia (Brazil) to parents Renato and Madalena. In 1967 he was still a child when Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil (two 25-year-old musicians from Bahia) started a movement that would radically change Brazilian and popular music: Tropicália. Osvaldo Alves da Silva (known as the Master of the Bongo) introduced him to the tradition of Brazilian folklore and its percussion: tambourine, drums and reco-reco. He soon learned all the secrets of the percussion instruments and developed a personal style he has never abandoned. In the early 1980s he started to work in the WR studios in Bahia, where he learned recording and record production techniques, in addition to initiating a task of recompilation and coding of rhythm and percussion sounds from the Bahia area. He then adopted his first nickname: Carlinhos Brown. ""It doesn't come from James Brown as people think"", he says. ""It is inspired in Henry Box Brown, a black person that escaped from slavery in a box. I also tried to learn from the good (and not the mistakes) of H. Rap Brown, of the Black Panther movement"". Musical career. Early years. Brown learned to play various percussion instruments as he grew up and in the 1980s he began to collaborate with other artists. In 1984 he played with Luís Caldas's band Acordes Verdes, one of the originators of samba-reggae, and in 1985 he formed part of Caetano Veloso's band on the record ""Estrangeiro"", penning a song, ""Meia Lua Inteira"", that was very successful in Brazil and outside the country. In 1985, Luís Caldas recorded “Visão de Cíclope”, composed by Carlinhos Brown, and it became one of the hottest songs on Salvador's radio stations. Following this, he composed “Remexer”, “O Côco” and “É Difícil” for other artists, earning him a Caymmi trophy, one of the most important music awards in Bahía, and led to his participation in world tours with João Gilberto, Djavan, and João Bosco. Timbalada. In the 1990s he became known nationally and internationally as the leader of the musical group Timbalada, which consisted of more than 100 percussionists and singers, called ""timbaleiros"", the majority of them young kids from the Candeal neighborhood of Salvador, where Carlinhos was born. They recorded eight albums and toured various countries around the world. Billboard Magazine named their debut album the ""best record produced in Latin America"" in 1993. In 1992, Brown appeared on several songs on the album ""Ritual Beating System"" by the project Bahia Black. Organized by prolific producer Bill Laswell, Bahia Black brought together Brazilian musicians with American jazz players. Solo career. On the heels of Timbalada's success, in 1996 Brown launched a solo album called ""Alfagamabetizado"", on which he sang, composed, and played the instruments. He followed this up with his second album ""Omelete Man"", and a third album, ""Bahia do Mundo, Mito e Verdade"". 1996 also saw Brown appearing on the album ""Roots"" by the Brazilian metal band Sepultura. In 1997, Brown made a cameo appearance performing the song ""A Namorada"" in the 1997 American film """", and appeared on the . In 1998, Brown collaborated with Bonga and Marisa Monte on the track ""Mulemba Xangola"" for the AIDS benefit compilation album """" produced by the Red Hot Organization. Brown released ""Carlinos Brown É Carlito Marrón"" in 2003 and collaborated with DJ Dero on the 2004 album ""Candyall Beat"". The ""Carlito Marrón"" album achieved considerable success in Spain where it was repackaged a year later with extra tracks, achieving a hit single ""Maria Caipirinha"" (with DJ Dero) on the Spanish charts in 2005. Carlinhos Brown remains active in the Salvador da Bahía community, founding the Pracatum Music School in the Candeal neighborhood in 1994 as a non-profit organization dedicated to education, cultural, and community development programs in the city, including a professional music school. In addition, Brown has his own recording label, Candyall Records. Brown has also begun painting, and his art works have been well received. On April 10, 2007, Carlinhos' new album, ""A Gente Ainda Não Sonhou"" was released by SonyBMG. It was recorded in Salvador de Bahia between March 2005 and September 2006. Two songs were co-written with Marisa Monte and Arnaldo Antunes. The record opens with Brazilian percussion mixed with electronica, psychedelic strings and booming beats; primitivism and sophistication with a technically naive feel, yet always maintaining the best of Brazil. The album continues with tracks that fuse electronic sounds with radiant rhythms, a rumba-tango with a Bahian feel, touches of dynamic reggae that clearly show the Brazilian/Jamaican connection, a syncopated funk and also two ballads, one that mixes acoustic with electronic ambiance and shows Brown's mastery of this type of music, and another with a magnificent string arrangement that adorns one of the most lyrical songs on the album. Carlinhos Brown is extensively featured in the 2004 documentary ""El Milagro de Candeal"". In 2011, he collaborated with Los Van Vans to record the track ""Soy Loco Por Tí, América"" for to the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album ""Red Hot + Rio 2"". The album is a follow-up to the 1996 ""Red Hot + Rio"". Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues. Tribalistas. In 2002 he formed the group Tribalistas with Arnaldo Antunes and Marisa Monte, contributing vocals and drums to their self-titled album ""Os Tribalistas"". Their single ""Já sei namorar"" became the number one song on Brazilian radio stations, and their second single ""Velha Infância"" met with almost equal success. The album spawned two more hits in Brazil, ""Passe Em Casa"", co-written with Margareth Menezes, and ""É Você"". In 2003, Tribalistas won the Best Album, Best DVD, and Best Song (for ""Já Sei Namorar"") awards from the Multishow of Brazilian Music. "
wikipedia-1500708," Indian Certificate of Secondary Education  The Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) is an examination conducted by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, a private, non-governmental board of school education in India, for class 10, i.e., grade 10. It has been designed to provide an examination in a course of general education, in accordance with the recommendations of the New Education Policy 1986 (India), through the medium of English. The examination allows secure suitable representation of Governments responsible for schools (which are affiliated to it) in their States/Territories. Private candidates are not permitted to appear for this examination. Subjects. The subjects that are offered are divided into three groups. Group I includes Compulsory Subjects - English, History , Civics & Geography, and Indian Language, Group II which includes any two from Mathematics, Science, Environmental Science, Computer Science, Agricultural Science, Commercial Studies, Technical Drawing, A Modern Foreign Language, A Classical Language and Economics, and Group III has any one from Computer Applications, Economic Applications, Commercial Applications, Art, Performing Arts, Home Science, Cookery, Fashion Designing, Physical Education, Technical Drawing Applications, Yoga, and Environmental Applications. All subjects have components of internal assessment, that are carried out by schools, on the basis of assignments/project work, practicals and coursework. There is 20% weightage for internal assessment in group I and II and 50% weightage for group III. In subjects where there are more than one paper(E.g., Science), the marks obtained in the subject are calculated by taking the average of all the papers in the subject. Candidates appearing for the examination have to study six subjects, with anywhere from 1 to 3 papers in each subject. For subject HC&G the paper 1 consists of History & Civics and paper 2 consists of Geography. Science consists of 3 papers each for Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. This makes for a total of 8-11 papers, depending on the subjects. Incidents. In 2013, A 20-year-old Indian student studying in the US, Debarghya Das, downloaded the ICSE scores for over one hundred thousand students by scraping the website. His analysis of the data showed surprising gaps and other patterns, suggesting that the data had been manipulated to allow students to pass who did not earn a passing mark.  "
wikipedia-2934297," Kalibangan  Kalibangān (; ; ) is a town located at on the left or southern banks of the Ghaggar (Ghaggar-Hakra River), identified by some scholars with Sarasvati River in Tehsil Pilibangān, between Suratgarh and Hanumāngarh in Hanumangarh district, Rajasthan, India 205 km. from Bikaner. It is also identified as being established in the triangle of land at the confluence of Drishadvathi and Sarasvathi Rivers. The prehistoric and pre-Mauryan character of Indus Valley Civilization was first identified by Luigi Tessitori at this site. Kalibangan's excavation report was published in its entirety in 2003 by the Archaeological Survey of India, 34 years after the completion of excavations. The report concluded that Kalibangan was a major provincial capital of the Indus Valley Civilization. Kalibangan is distinguished by its unique fire altars and ""world's earliest attested ploughed field"". Indus Valley Civilization. The identity of Kalibangan as a pre-historic site was discovered by Luigi Pio Tessitori, an Italian Indologist (1887–1919). He was doing some research in ancient Indian texts. He was surprised by the character of ruins in that area, and he sought help from Sir John Marshall of the Archaeological Survey of India. At that time ASI had some excavations done on Harappa, but they never had any idea about the character of the ruins. In fact, Tessitori is the first person to recognize that the ruins are 'Prehistoric' and pre-Mauryan. Luigi Pio Tessitori also pointed out the nature of the culture, but at that time it was not possible to guess that Indus Valley Civilisation lay in the ruins of Kalibangan, and he died five years before Harappan culture was duly recognized. After India's independence, both the major Harappan cities together with the Indus became a part of Pakistan and Indian archaeologists were compelled to intensify the search for Harappan sites in India. Amlānand Ghosh (Ex. Director General, Archaeological Survey of India, or ASI) was the first person to recognise this site as Harappan and marked it out for excavations. Under the leadership of B. B. Lal (then Director General, ASI), Balkrishna (B.K.) Thapar, M. D. Khare, K. M. Shrivastava and S. P. Jain carried out excavations for 9 years (1960-9) in 9 successive excavation sessions. Two ancient mounds were excavated, spread over half kilometre (area quarter square kilometre). On western side is the smaller mound (KLB1), 9 meters high and known as citadel. Eastern mound is higher (12 meters) and bigger, known as lower city (KLB2). The excavation unexpectedly brought to light a twofold sequence of cultures, of which the upper one (Kalibangan I) belongs to the Harappan, showing the characteristic grid layout of a metropolis and the lower one (Kalibangan II) was formerly called pre-Harappan but now it is called ""Early Harappan or antecedent Harappan"". Other nearby sites belonging to IVC include Balu, Haryana, Kunal, Haryana, Banawali etc. Proto-Harappan Phase. Traces of pre-Harappan culture have been found only at the lower levels of the western mound. According to archaeological evidence, the Indus Valley culture existed at the site from the proto-Harappan age (3500 BC - 2500 BC) to the Harappan age (2500 BC - 1750 BC). This earlier phase is labelled Kalibangan-I (KLB-I) or Period-I.Similarity of pottery relates Kalibangan-I with the Sothi culture because this type of pottery was first discovered at Sothi village in North Western India. Fort and houses. In this phase, the settlement was fortified, using dried mud bricks, from the beginning of occupation. This fort had been built twice in different periods. Earlier, fort wall had a thickness of 1.9 meters, which was raised to 3.7-4.1 meters during reconstruction in this phase. Brick size was 20 × 20 × 10 cm in both construction-phases. The citadel mound (smaller mound) is a parallelogram about 130 meters on the east-west axis and 260 meters on the north-south. Town planning was like that of Mohenjodaro or Harappa. The direction of houses and brick sizes was markedly different from that used in the Harappan phase (KLB-II). Within the walled area, the houses were also built of mud bricks of the same size as used in the fort wall; the use of burnt bricks is attested by a drain within the houses, remains of ovens and cylindrical pits, lined with lime plaster. Some burnt wedge shaped bricks also have been found. Earliest ploughed field. B. B. Lal, former DG of ASI, said : ""Kalibangan in Rajasthan has given the evidence of the earliest (c. 2800 BC) ploughed agricultural field ever revealed through an excavation."". It has been found south east of the pre-Harappan settlement, outside the fort. ""Kalibangan excavations in present western Rajasthan shows a ploughed field, the first site of this nature in the world. It shows a grid pattern of furrows, placed about 30 cm apart running east-west and other spaced about 190 cm apart running north-south, a pattern remarkably similar to the one practiced even now."". Even today, similar ploughing is used for two simultaneous crops in this region, esp. of mustard and gram. For preservation, this excavated ploughed field area was refilled after excavation and the area was marked by concrete pillar posts. Pottery. The distinguishing mark of this early phase is pottery, characterized by six fabrics labelled A, B, C, D, E and F, which were first identified at Sothi in North Western India. Fabrics A, B, and D can be clubbed together. They are red painted. Fabric-A is carelessly potted in spite of use of potter's wheel. It contains designs in light-black, often decorated with white lines. Lines, semicircles, grids, insects, flowers, leaves, trees and squares were favourite motifs. Fabric-B shows marked improvement in finishing, but the lower half was deliberately roughened. Flowers, animals were painted in black on red background. Fabric-D contained designs of slanted lines or semicircles in some, while most pots were plain. But Fabric-C pottery was thicker and stronger. Fabric-C was distinguished by violet tinge and fine polish, with designs in black; it is the best proto-Harappan pottery in finishing. Fabric-E was light colored and Fabric-F was grey. Other finds. Among the other finds of this Period are: small blades of chalcedony and agate, sometimes serrated or backed; beads of steatite, shell, carnelian, terracotta and copper; bangles of copper, shell and terracotta; terracotta objects like a toy-cart, wheel and a broken bull; quem with mullers, a bone point, and copper celts, including an unusual axe, etc. Toy carts suggest carts were used for transportation in early phase of Kalibangan. Earliest earthquakes & end of Phase-I. B. B. Lal, former DG of ASI, said : ""Kalibangan in Rajasthan ... has also shown that there occurred an earthquake around 2600 BC, which brought to an end the Early Indus settlement at the site."". This is perhaps the earliest archaeologically recorded earthquake. At least three pre-historic earthquakes affecting the Indus Valley Civilization at Dholavira in Khadir have been identified during 2900–1800 BC. KLB-I phase has left 1.6 meters of continuous deposits during five distinct structural strata, the last of which was destroyed perhaps by an earthquake and the site was abandoned around 2600 BCE, soon to be settled again by Harappans. Harappan Phase. Fire altars. At Kalibangan, fire Vedic altars have been discovered, similar to those found at Lothal which S.R. Rao thinks could have served no other purpose than a ritualistic one. These altars suggest fire worship or worship of Agni, the Hindu god of fire. It is the only Indus Valley Civilization site where there is no evidence to suggest the worship of the ""mother goddess"". Within the fortified citadel complex, the southern half contained many (five or six) raised platforms of mud bricks, mutually separated by corridors. Stairs were attached to these platforms. Vandalism of these platforms by brick robbers makes it difficult to reconstruct the original shape of structures above them but unmistakable remnants of rectangular or oval ""s"" or fire-pits of burnt bricks for ""Vedi (altar)s"" have been found, with a ""yūpa"" or sacrificial post (cylindrical or with rectangular cross-section, sometimes bricks were laid upon each other to construct such a post) in the middle of each and sacrificial terracotta cakes () in all these fire-pits. Houses in the lower town also contain similar altars. Burnt charcoals have been found in these fire-pits. The structure of these fire-altars is reminiscent of (Vedic) fire-altars, but the analogy may be coincidental, and these altars are perhaps intended for some specific (perhaps religious) purpose by the community as a whole. In some fire-altars remnants of animals have been found, which suggest a possibility of animal-sacrifice. The official website of ASI reports : ""Besides the above two principle parts of the metropolis there was also a third one-a moderate structure situated upwards of 8O m e. of the lower town containing four to five fire altars. This lonely structure may perhaps have been used for ritual purposes."" Thus, fire-altars have been found in three groups : public altars in the citadel, household altars in lower town, and public altars in a third separate group. Lower town. The lower town was also a fortified parallelogram, although only traces are now left. The fort was made of mud bricks (40 × 20 × 10 cm) and three or four structural phases have been recognized. It had gates in north and west. B. B. Lal wrote :""Well-regulated streets (were) oriented almost invariably along with the cardinal directions, thus forming a grid-iron pattern. (At Kalibangan) even the widths of these streets were in a set ratio, i.e. if the narrowest lane was one unit in width, the other streets were twice, thrice and so on. (...) Such a town-planning was unknown in contemporary West Asia."". The lower town was 239 meters east to west, but north-south extent cannot be determined. 8 main roads have been recognized, 5 north-south and 3 east-west. Few more east-west roads are expected to be buried within the unexcavated remains. Second east-west road ran in a curved outline to meet the first at the north-eastern end (towards the river), where a gateway was provided. This road was an anomaly in the grid-pattern of straight roads. There were many lanes connected to specific housing complexes. Roads and lanes had widths in accurately determined proportions, like in other Harappan cities, ranging from 7.2 meters for main roads to 1.8 meters for narrow lanes. Fender posts were installed at street corners to prevent accidents. In second structural level, roads were laid with mud tiles. Drains from houses emptied into pits (soakage jars) beneath the roads. Some central authority must be there to plan and regulate all this. Housing. Like town planning, housing also followed the common pattern of other Harappan cities. Due to grid-pattern of town planning like a chess board, all houses opened out to at least two or three roads or lanes. Each house had a courtyard and 6-7 rooms on three sides, with a well in some houses. One house had stairs for going to the roof. Houses were built of 30 × 15 × 7.5 cm mud bricks (same as those used in second structural phase of fort wall). Burnt bricks were used in drains, wells, bathing platforms and door-sills, besides fire-altar. Floors of rooms were built of thrashed fine mud, sometimes laid with mud bricks or terracotta cakes. One house had floors built of burnt tiles decorated with geometrical designs. Kalibangan 1953 A. Ghosh Situated in Rajasthan on the Bank of Ghaggar 1. Shows both Pre Harappan and Harappan phase 2. Evidence of furrowed land 3. Evidence of camel bones 4. Many houses had their own well 5. Kalibangan stand for black bangles 6. Evidence of wooden furrow Terracota. Some early Kalibangan pottery has close resemblance to the pottery of the Hakra ware in Cholistan, to other Early Harappan pottery from the Indus Valley Civilization and to the pottery of the Integration Era. Functionally, pottery can be classified into household pots, religious and burial purposes. Structurally, we have classes like plain and decorated wares. Some pots had Harappan inscriptions (undeciphered) on them. The best terracota figure from Kalibangan is that a charging bull which is considered to signify the ""realistic and powerful folk art of Harappan Age"". The city is known for the numerous terracota bangles found here. Seals. A number of seals have been found dating to this phase. Most noteworthy is a cylindrical seal, depicting a female figure between two male figures, fighting or threatening with spears. There is also a mixed person bull observing. Other finds. A cylindrical graduated measuring rod and a clay ball with human figures are other notable finds. Peas and chikpeas were also found. Burial systems. Three systems of burial have been attested in the burial ground ~300 yards south-west of the citadel, where ~34 graves have been found : End of civilization. Robert Raikes has argued that Kalibangan was abandoned because the river dried up. Prof. B. B. Lal (retd. Director General of Archaeological Survey of India) supports this view by asserting: ""Radiocarbon dates indicate that the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan had to be abandoned around 2000–1900 BCE. And, as the hydrological evidence indicates, this abandonment took place on account of the drying up of the Sarasvati (Ghaggar).

wikipedia-576172," Jeffrey Katzenberg  Jeffrey Katzenberg (born December 21, 1950) is an American businessman and film producer. As a businessman, he is the CEO of DreamWorks Animation and is also known for his tenure as chairman of The Walt Disney Studios from 1984 to 1994, during which the studio reinvigorated its live-action and animation department, as well as producing some of its biggest hits, including ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"". As a founder and CEO of DreamWorks Animation, he has overseen the production of such animated franchises as ""Shrek"", ""Madagascar"", ""Kung Fu Panda"", ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"". Early life. Katzenberg was born in New York City, to a Jewish family, the son of Anne, an artist, and Walter Katzenberg, a stockbroker. He attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, graduating in 1969. When he was 14, Katzenberg volunteered to work on Republican John Lindsay's successful New York mayoral campaign. He quickly received the nickname ""Squirt"" and attended as many meetings as he could. He was described as ""kind of a weasel"" by one of Lindsay's aides. Professional career. Paramount Pictures. Katzenberg began his career as an assistant to producer David Picker, then in 1974 he became an assistant to Barry Diller, the Chairman of Paramount Pictures. Diller moved Katzenberg to the marketing department, followed by other assignments within the studio, until he was assigned to revive the ""Star Trek"" franchise, which resulted in the hit film, """" (1979). He continued to work his way up and became President of Production under Paramount President Michael Eisner. The Walt Disney Company. In 1984, Michael Eisner became Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at The Walt Disney Company. Eisner brought Katzenberg with him to take charge of Disney’s motion picture division. Katzenberg was responsible for reviving the studio which, at the time, ranked last at the box office among the major studios. He focused the studio on the production of adult-oriented comedies under its Touchstone Pictures imprint, including films such as ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills"" (1986), ""Three Men and a Baby"" (1987) and ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" (1987). By 1987, Disney had become the number-one studio at the box office. Katzenberg also oversaw Touchstone Television, which produced such hit TV series, ""The Golden Girls"" and ""Home Improvement"". Katzenberg was also charged with turning around Disney's ailing Feature Animation unit, creating some intrastudio controversy when he personally edited three minutes out of a completed Disney animated feature, ""The Black Cauldron"" (1985), shortly after joining the company. Under his management, the animation department eventually began creating some of Disney's most critically acclaimed and highest grossing animated features. These films include ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988), ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989),""The Rescuers Down Under"" (1990), ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991), which was the first animated feature to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, ""Aladdin"" (1992), and ""The Lion King"" (1994). In addition, Katzenberg also sealed the deal that created the highly successful partnership between Pixar and Disney and the deal that brought Miramax Films into Disney. When Eisner’s second in command, Frank Wells, died in a helicopter crash in 1994, Eisner refused to promote Katzenberg to the vacated position of president. This led to a falling out between the two executives, and Katzenberg left the company in September 1994. He launched a lawsuit against Disney to recover money he felt he was owed and settled out of court for an estimated $250 million. DreamWorks SKG. Later in 1994, Katzenberg co-founded DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, with Katzenberg taking primary responsibility for animation operations. He was also credited as executive producer on the DreamWorks animated films ""The Prince of Egypt"" (1998), ""The Road to El Dorado"" and ' (both in 2000), ""Shrek"" in 2001, ' in 2002, and ""Shrek 2"" in 2004. After DreamWorks Animation suffered a $125 million loss on the traditionally-animated """", Katzenberg believed that telling traditional stories using traditional animation is a thing of the past, and the studio switched to all computer-generated animation. Since then, DreamWorks' animated feature films have been consistently successful financially and critically with several Annie Awards and Academy Awards nominations and wins. DreamWorks Animation. In 2004, DreamWorks Animation (DWA) was spun off from DreamWorks as a separate company headed by Katzenberg in an IPO and has recorded mostly profitable quarters since then. The live-action DreamWorks movie studio was sold to Viacom in December 2005. In 2008, the live-action DreamWorks studio again became an independent production company, releasing its films through Disney. In 2006, Katzenberg made an appearance on the fifth season of ""The Apprentice"". He awarded the task winners an opportunity to be character voices in ""Over the Hedge"". Katzenberg has been an industry leader in promoting digital 3D production of film, calling it ""the greatest advance in the film industry since the arrival of color in the 1930s."" When Katzenberg appeared on ""The Colbert Report"" on April 20, 2010, he confirmed that from now on ""every single movie"" that DreamWorks Animation produced would be in 3D and gave Stephen Colbert a pair of new 3D glasses. It was reported that Katzenberg receives an airfare allowance of $1.5 million per year, which was the most of all media-company CEOs. Political activities. Katzenberg is a long time supporter of Barack Obama. Reportedly ""smitten"" by Obama's speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Katzenberg pledged his full support to Obama in 2006 if he decided to run for President. During his campaign, Obama praised Katzenberg for his ""tenacious support and advocacy since we started back in 2007."" Katzenberg has been an avid fundraiser for Obama, doing so while much of Hollywood was still supporting the Clintons. His fundraising prowess has reportedly allowed him to become an ""informal liaison"" between Hollywood and the White House. Katzenberg co-hosted a fundraiser for President Obama at the home of actor George Clooney in May 2012. Katzenberg said that the event raised almost $15 million, which would make it the most profitable presidential fundraiser in history. It was reported that Obama campaign officials were not happy about some of the requests that Katzenberg had made. In particular, they were bothered that Katzenberg, who reportedly had made himself ""indispensable to Obama"", required that the President spend time talking at each of the 14 tables. When the details of Oriental DreamWorks emerged, Jennifer Rubin noted that Post the Obama Administration's potential involvement in the deal would not be an issue if not for Katzenberg's May fundraiser for Obama and his “huge campaign donations.”  It was reported that Katzenberg was Obama’s top bundler, who, along with Andy Spahn, had contributed at least $6.6 million combined for both of Obama's campaigns. In an MSNBC interview about the donations, Nicholas Confessore noted Katzenberg's desire to build movie studios in China, saying that he would need help from the Obama administration to get this done and that ""has interests at stake."" Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation suggested that Katzenberg's long history of financial support for Obama may have influenced the movie deal being ""fast-track[ed"" by the White House, noting that DreamWorks Animation ""never registered to lobby the federal government."" It was reported that Obama arrived in Los Angeles on October 7, 2012, where he joined Bill Clinton at Katzenberg's Beverly Hills home for a private meeting with several deep-pocketed Democratic donors. Obama's campaign indicated the meeting was to thank supporters, but some members of the campaign finance committee said that it involved the pro-Obama PAC Priorities USA Action. Members of the White House press corps who had traveled to California with Obama were kept in the garage of Katzenberg's mansion and one reporter called the meeting ""unusual"". Katzenberg, who had previously donated $2 million to the pro-Obama PAC Priorities USA Action, donated an additional $1 million in October 2012. SEC investigation. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation in April 2012 into accusations that Katzenberg had bribed Chinese officials in an effort to obtain distribution rights, as Joe Biden was negotiating a deal to increase film quotas. SOPA/PIPA. Katzenberg took a leading role in pushing the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which Hollywood reportedly saw as ""an existential threat."" When the White House announced its opposition to the bill in January 2012, Chris Dodd, the former Senator and head of the Motion Picture Association of America, the film industry's lobbying organization, contacted Katzenberg to obtain more information about the president's plans. When Dodd reportedly asked him to intervene, Katzenberg declined, but ""sought to soothe hurt feelings and lay the groundwork for a deal more friendly to Hollywood."" Katzenberg's office contacted Obama and urged him to contact other studio chiefs in order to reaffirm their support. Obama would take the advice, making Katzenberg one of the few Hollywood executives working on brokering a compromise with Silicon Valley. Academy Award. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in September 2012 that the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award would be presented to Katzenberg at the Oscar ceremony in 2013 in acknowledgment of his role in “raising money for education, art and health-related causes, particularly those benefiting the motion picture industry.” Personal life. Katzenberg married Marilyn Siegel, a kindergarten teacher, in 1975. They have two twin children, Laura and David. David is a television producer and director. Together, Marilyn and Jeffrey have been highly active in charitable causes. They donated the multi-million-dollar Katzenberg Center to Boston University's College of General Studies, citing that the school gave their two children the ""love of education."" They also donated the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Center for Animation at the University of Southern California. In addition to serving as Chairman of the Board for the Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation, Katzenberg sits on the boards or serves as a trustee of AIDS Project Los Angeles, American Museum of the Moving Image, California Institute of the Arts, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Geffen Playhouse, Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts and The Simon Wiesenthal Center. Together with DreamWorks Animation, Katzenberg founded the DreamWorks Animation Academy of Inner-City Arts in 2008. In recognition of his efforts, Katzenberg received the 85th Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2013 American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Governors Awards Presentation on Decem­ber 1 at The Ray Dolby Ball­room at Hol­ly­wood & High­land Center. Katzenberg has an estimated worth of $800 million according to ""Forbes"". Katzenberg is reported to have donated over $3.5 million in political contributions since 1979: 33% ($1.171+ million) to Democrats, 66% ($2.33+ million) to special interest groups without party affiliations, and less than 1% ($7,000) to Republicans. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Ringling College of Art and Design on May 2, 2008. "
wikipedia-21280018," Component business model  Component Business Model (CBM) is a technique developed by IBM to model and analyze an enterprise. It is a logical representation or map of business components or ""building blocks"" and can be depicted on a single page. It can be used to analyze the alignment of enterprise strategy with the organization's capabilities and investments, identify redundant or overlapping business capabilities, analyze sourcing options for the different components (buy or build), prioritizing transformation options and can be used to create a unified roadmap after mergers or acquisitions. The model is organized as business components along columns and ""operational levels"" along rows. The Business components are defined partly as large business areas with characteristic skills, IT capabilities and process. The three operational levels are ""Direct"", ""Control"" and ""Execute"" - they separate strategic decisions (Direct), management checks (Control), and business actions (Execute) on business competencies. Criticism. With the components developmentcompetency development, “Logic” and “value” became words in the literature on business models. However over the past years, Business Model approaches have developed and include today business model design, business model innovation and business model transformation. Even though IBM’s business model approach can be used to map components of a business model or product, the following critic points have been identified. IBM's Component Business Model approach: At last, but not least, the IBM CBM appears rather empirical than conceptual. It is not obvious why particular cells present in the CMB matrix if ""each component business map is unique to each company"", are they common for all enterprises, are they typical to particular industry, and so on. If a company has a purpose and goal(s), how the IBM CBM relates to this purpose, what mechanisms are used for establishing this relationships in company specific/unique business landscape? Nonetheless, it is not possible to see how the IBM CBM mapping provides the view ""which components of the business really create differentiation and value"", ""where you have capability gaps that need to be addressed"", and how ""you can identify opportunities to improve efficiency and lower costs across the entire enterprise. Identify the components where you can realise the greatest impact"". Certainly, knowing what you have is the baseline for further modifications but this map is mute without additional information about corresponding components' values, deltas/gaps to your targets and component inter-dependencies (impacts). As of ""opportunities to improve efficiency and lower costs"", these categories are simply invisible on such map. So, what does IBM CBM actually provides beside a convenient single map of consultants' discoveries about your enterprise? "
wikipedia-385846," Kaon  In particle physics, a kaon , also called a K meson and denoted , is any of a group of four mesons distinguished by a quantum number called strangeness. In the quark model they are understood to be bound states of a strange quark (or antiquark) and an up or down antiquark (or quark). Kaons have proved to be a copious source of information on the nature of fundamental interactions since their discovery in cosmic rays in 1947. They were essential in establishing the foundations of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as the quark model of hadrons and the theory of quark mixing (the latter was acknowledged by a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2008). Kaons have played a distinguished role in our understanding of fundamental conservation laws: CP violation, a phenomenon generating the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, was discovered in the kaon system in 1964 (which was acknowledged by a Nobel prize in 1980). Moreover, direct CP violation was also discovered in the kaon decays in the early 2000s. Basic properties. The four kaons are : It is clear from the quark model assignments that the kaons form two doublets of isospin; that is, they belong to the fundamental representation of SU(2) called the 2. One doublet of strangeness +1 contains the and the . The antiparticles form the other doublet (of strangeness −1).  Although the and its antiparticle are usually produced via the strong force, they decay weakly. Thus, once created the two are better thought of as superpositions of two weak eigenstates which have vastly different lifetimes: An experimental observation made in 1964 that K-longs rarely decay into two pions was the discovery of CP violation (see below). Main decay modes for : Decay modes for the are charge conjugates of the ones above. Strangeness. The discovery of hadrons with the internal quantum number ""strangeness"" marks the beginning of a most exciting epoch in particle physics that even now, fifty years later, has not yet found its conclusion ... by and large experiments have driven the development, and that major discoveries came unexpectedly or even against expectations expressed by theorists.  — I.I. Bigi and A.I. Sanda, ""CP violation"", (ISBN 0-521-44349-0) In 1947, G. D. Rochester and Clifford Charles Butler of the University of Manchester published two cloud chamber photographs of cosmic ray-induced events, one showing what appeared to be a neutral particle decaying into two charged pions, and one which appeared to be a charged particle decaying into a charged pion and something neutral. The estimated mass of the new particles was very rough, about half a proton's mass. More examples of these ""V-particles"" were slow in coming. The first breakthrough was obtained at Caltech, where a cloud chamber was taken up Mount Wilson, for greater cosmic ray exposure. In 1950, 30 charged and 4 neutral V-particles were reported. Inspired by this, numerous mountaintop observations were made over the next several years, and by 1953, the following terminology was adopted: ""L-meson"" meant muon or pion. ""K meson"" meant a particle intermediate in mass between the pion and nucleon. ""Hyperon"" meant any particle heavier than a nucleon. The decays were extremely slow; typical lifetimes are of the order of . However, production in pion-proton reactions proceeds much faster, with a time scale of . The problem of this mismatch was solved by Abraham Pais who postulated the new quantum number called ""strangeness"" which is conserved in strong interactions but violated by the weak interactions. Strange particles appear copiously due to ""associated production"" of a strange and an antistrange particle together. It was soon shown that this could not be a multiplicative quantum number, because that would allow reactions which were never seen in the new synchrotrons which were commissioned in Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1953 and in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1955. Parity violation. Two different decays were found for charged strange mesons: The intrinsic parity of a meson is P=−1, and parity is a multiplicative quantum number. Therefore, the two final states have different parity (P=+1 and P=−1, respectively). It was thought that the initial states should also have different parities, and hence be two distinct particles. However, with increasingly precise measurements, no difference was found between the masses and lifetimes of each, respectively, indicating that they are the same particle. This was known as the τ–θ puzzle. It was resolved only by the discovery of parity violation in weak interactions. Since the mesons decay through weak interactions, parity is not conserved, and the two decays are actually decays of the same particle, now called the . CP violation in neutral meson oscillations. Initially it was thought that although parity was violated, CP (charge parity) symmetry was conserved. In order to understand the discovery of CP violation, it is necessary to understand the mixing of neutral kaons; this phenomenon does not require CP violation, but it is the context in which CP violation was first observed. Neutral kaon mixing. Since neutral kaons carry strangeness, they cannot be their own antiparticles. There must be then two different neutral kaons, differing by two units of strangeness. The question was then how to establish the presence of these two mesons. The solution used a phenomenon called neutral particle oscillations, by which these two kinds of mesons can turn from one into another through the weak interactions, which cause them to decay into pions (see the adjacent figure). These oscillations were first investigated by Murray Gell-Mann and Abraham Pais together. They considered the CP-invariant time evolution of states with opposite strangeness. In matrix notation one can write where ψ is a quantum state of the system specified by the amplitudes of being in each of the two basis states (which are ""a"" and ""b"" at time ""t"" = 0). The diagonal elements (""M"") of the Hamiltonian are due to strong interaction physics which conserves strangeness. The two diagonal elements must be equal, since the particle and antiparticle have equal masses in the absence of the weak interactions. The off-diagonal elements, which mix opposite strangeness particles, are due to weak interactions; CP symmetry requires them to be real. The consequence of the matrix ""H"" being real is that the probabilities of the two states will forever oscillate back and forth. However, if any part of the matrix were imaginary, as is forbidden by CP symmetry, then part of the combination will diminish over time. The diminishing part can be either one component (""a"") or the other (""b""), or a mixture of the two. Mixing. The eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, which we can call K1 which is the difference of the two states of opposite strangeness, and K2, which is the sum. The two are eigenstates of CP with opposite eigenvalues; K1 has CP = +1, and K2 has CP = -1 Since the two-pion final state also has CP = +1, only the K1 can decay this way. The K2 must decay into three pions. Since the mass of K2 is just a little larger than the sum of the masses of three pions, this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of K1 into two pions. These two different modes of decay were observed by Leon Lederman and his coworkers in 1956, establishing the existence of the two weak eigenstates (states with definite lifetimes under decays via the weak force) of the neutral kaons. These two weak eigenstates are called the (K-long) and (K-short). CP symmetry, which was assumed at the time, implies that  = K1 and  = K2. Oscillation. An initially pure beam of will turn into its antiparticle while propagating, which will turn back into the original particle, and so on. This is called particle oscillation. On observing the weak decay ""into leptons"", it was found that a always decayed into an electron, whereas the antiparticle decayed into the positron. The earlier analysis yielded a relation between the rate of electron and positron production from sources of pure and its antiparticle . Analysis of the time dependence of this semileptonic decay showed the phenomenon of oscillation, and allowed the extraction of the mass splitting between the and . Since this is due to weak interactions it is very small, 10−15 times the mass of each state. Regeneration. A beam of neutral kaons decays in flight so that the short-lived disappears, leaving a beam of pure long-lived . If this beam is shot into matter, then the and its antiparticle interact differently with the nuclei. The undergoes quasi-elastic scattering with nucleons, whereas its antiparticle can create hyperons. Due to the different interactions of the two components, quantum coherence between the two particles is lost. The emerging beam then contains different linear superpositions of the and . Such a superposition is a mixture of and ; the is regenerated by passing a neutral kaon beam through matter. Regeneration was observed by Oreste Piccioni and his collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Soon thereafter, Robert Adair and his coworkers reported excess regeneration, thus opening a new chapter in this history. CP violation. While trying to verify Adair's results, in 1964 James Cronin and Val Fitch of BNL found decays of into two pions (CP = +1). As explained in an earlier section, this required the assumed initial and final states to have different values of CP, and hence immediately suggested CP violation. Alternative explanations such as non-linear quantum mechanics and a new unobserved particle were soon ruled out, leaving CP violation as the only possibility. Cronin and Fitch received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in 1980. It turns out that although the and are weak eigenstates (because they have definite lifetimes for decay by way of the weak force), they are ""not quite"" CP eigenstates. Instead, for small ε (and up to normalization), and similarly for . Thus occasionally the decays as a K1 with CP = +1, and likewise the can decay with CP = −1. This is known as indirect CP violation, CP violation due to mixing of and its antiparticle. There is also a direct CP violation effect, in which the CP violation occurs during the decay itself. Both are present, because both mixing and decay arise from the same interaction with the W boson and thus have CP violation predicted by the CKM matrix. "
wikipedia-1565743," HM Prison Bronzefield  HMP Bronzefield is a Category A adult and young offender female's prison located on the outskirts of Ashford in Surrey, England. Bronzefield is the only purpose-built private prison solely for women in the UK, and is the largest female prison in Europe. The prison is operated by Sodexo Justice Services. History. Bronzefield Prison was opened in June 2004 as the UK's new top security prison for women. Since its opening Bronzefield has been the subject of many news articles in the tabloid press, most notably about well-known prisoners, its supposedly lax regime and continued poor industrial relations. In 2009, a 77 bed unit was built on the existing site, taking the operational capacity up to 527. In 2012 it was reported that Bronzefield was the first prison in the UK to have its own branch of the Women's Institute. The branch is for members of staff and inmates who are taking part of resettlement programmes ahead of their release. The prison today. HM Prison Bronzefield is currently one of only two prisons to house Category A prisoners in the female estate (female and juvenile category-A prisoners are called ""restricted status"" prisoners). The prison is staffed by approx 160 prison officers which has a ratio of 60% female and 40% male officers to reflect the need for a women's prison. Bronzefield is also a local prison, taking prisoners directly from the courts. Bronzefield holds a wide range of female offenders, including remand, sentenced and restricted status women. Accommodation at Bronzefield is divided into four main residential units, each holding approximately 135 women. The prison also has a 12 bed Mother and Baby Unit, accommodating children up to 18 months old. Bronzefield has a Level 4 Healthcare provision with inpatient facilities for 18 women, as well as a smaller 10-bed Help & Direction Unit. Bronzefield offers full-time education courses including Art, ESOL and Information Technology. There are also workshops in Painting and Decorating, Cleaning Science and Arts and Crafts. A 2013 report by the chief inspector of prisons praised the institution for its efforts to tackle alcohol problems and self-harm, improvements in health care, and its induction and reception facilities. However it was condemned their segregation practices, in particular for keeping a prisoner in segregation for five years in bad conditions, treatment which ""appears to amount to torture"". "
wikipedia-7196304," Horse markings  Markings on horses usually are distinctive white areas on an otherwise dark base coat color. Most horses have some markings, and they help to identify the horse as a unique individual. Markings are present at birth and do not change over the course of the horse's life. Most markings have pink skin underneath most of the white hairs, though a few faint markings may occasionally have white hair with no underlying pink skin. Markings may appear to change slightly when a horse grows or sheds its winter coat, however the difference is simply a factor of hair coat length, the underlying design does not change. On a gray horse, markings visible at birth may become hidden as the horse turns white with age, but markings can still be determined by trimming the horse's hair closely, then wetting down the coat to see where there is pink skin and black skin under the hair. Types of white markings. Facial markings. Facial markings are usually described by shape and location. There may be more than one distinct facial marking and if so, will be named separately. Occasionally, when a white marking extends over an eye, that eye may be blue instead of brown, though this is not consistently seen in all cases. Common facial markings are: Additional terms used to describe facial markings include the following: Leg markings. Leg markings are usually described by the highest point of the horse's leg that is covered by white. As a general rule, the horse's hoof beneath a white marking at the coronary line will also be light-colored (""white""). If a horse has a partial marking or ermine spots at the coronary band, the hoof may be both dark and light, corresponding with the hair coat immediately above. Where the Leopard gene is present, the hoof may be striped even if markings are not visible at the coronary band. From tallest to shortest, common leg markings are: Additional terms used to describe white leg markings include: Other markings. Horses may have isolated body spots that are not large or numerous enough to qualify them as an Appaloosa, Pinto or Paint. Such markings are usually simply called ""body spots,"" sometimes identified by location, i.e. ""belly spot,"" ""flank spot,"" etc. When this type of isolated spotting occurs, it is usually the action of the sabino gene. Horses may develop white markings over areas where there was an injury to the animal, either to cover scar tissue from a cut or abrasion, or to reflect harm to the underlying skin or nerves. One common type of scarring that produces patches of white hairs are ""saddle marks,"" which are round or oval marks on either side of the withers, produced by a pinching saddle that had been worn over a long period of time. Natural markings. ""Birdcatcher spots"" are small white spots, usually between 1 mm and 1 inch (25.4 mm) in diameter. It is not yet known what controls their expression, although it is believed that they are not genetic. Birdcatcher spots occur in many breeds. These spots may occur late in a horse's life, or may occur and then disappear. ""Ticking"" or ""Birdcatcher ticks"" are markings that involves white flecks of hair at the flank, and white hairs at the base of the tail, called a ""skunk tail"". These patterns are permanent and probably genetic. It is thought that this roaning effect might be linked to the rabicano gene. The name comes from a Thoroughbred horse named Birdcatcher, who had white hairs throughout his flank and tail. Scarring, skin disease and injury. Scarring on a horse usually results in white hairs growing in over the injured area, though occasionally there may be no hair growth over the scar at all. Other identifying features. Horses can be uniquely identified by more than just markings or brands. A few other physical characteristics sometimes used to distinguish a horse from another are: Coat Colors with distinctive patterns. Some horse coat colors are distinguished by unique patterns. However, even for horses with coat colors that are arranged in a manner unique to each individual horse, these patterns are not called ""markings."" Some coat colors partially distinguished by unique patterning include: "

wikipedia-868588," Oleg Kalugin  Oleg Danilovich Kalugin (), (born September 6, 1934) is a former KGB general and double agent. He was a longtime head of KGB operations in the United States and later a critic of the agency. Early life and the KGB career. Born in Leningrad and son of an officer in the NKVD, Kalugin attended Leningrad State University and, subsequently, was recruited by the KGB under the aegis of the First Chief Directorate (Foreign Intelligence). After training he was sent to the United States, where he enrolled as a journalism student at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship in 1958, along with Aleksandr Yakovlev. He continued to pose as a journalist for a number of years, eventually serving as the Radio Moscow correspondent at the United Nations. In 1965 â after five years in New York â he returned to Moscow to serve under the cover of press officer in the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Kalugin was then assigned to Washington, D.C., with the cover of deputy press officer for the Soviet Embassy. In reality he was deputy resident and acting chief of the Residency at the Soviet Embassy. Rising in the ranks he became one of the KGB's top officers operating out of the Soviet embassy in Washington: it led to his being promoted to general in 1974, the youngest in its history. He then returned to KGB headquarters to become head of the foreign counterintelligence or K branch of the First Chief Directorate. During this time he received high honors for the assassination of Bulgarian writer Georgi Markov, which had been accomplished on a request from Todor Zhivkov and ordered by the KGB chief Yuri Andropov. KGB criticism. In 1980 Kalugin was demoted to deputy head of the Leningrad KGB as a result of an intrigue initiated by Vladimir Kryuchkov who was at this time a close confidant of Yuri Andropov and had been privately criticized by Kalugin. Kalugin was accused of recruiting an agent twenty years prior who was actually an American spy. This made Kalugin himself seem to be a security risk. He was suspected of working for the CIA, although there was no supporting evidence. Vladimir Kryuchkov, Chairman of the KGB and orchestrator of the 1991 coup plot, alleged that in his time in counterintelligence he failed to discover a single American agent while his successor would allegedly find over a dozen. Former CIA mole Karl Koecher made unsupported claims that Kalugin was responsible for Koecher's eventual arrest. The unsubstantiated accusations did not stop him from criticizing the agency's policies and methods, complaining about the fact that the KGB was overlooking corruption in the highest circles of Soviet society while terrorizing common people. His unbridled public criticism led to reassignment to Security Officers posts first in the Academy of Sciences in 1987, then at the Ministry of Electronics in 1988. His career at the KGB ended with his forced retirement on February 26, 1990. As the Soviet Union underwent changes under Mikhail Gorbachev, Kalugin became more vocal and public in his criticism of the KGB, denouncing Soviet security forces as ""Stalinist"" domestic political police, although he never disputed the importance of espionage abroad. Finally, in 1990, Gorbachev signed a decree stripping Kalugin of his rank, decorations, and pension. In August 1991, Gorbachev returned his rank, decorations and pension. Despite opposition from the KGB, he was elected in September 1990 to the Supreme Soviet as a People's Deputy for the Krasnodar region. Countering the Soviet coup attempt. Kalugin became a firm supporter of Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian SFSR. During the abortive Soviet coup attempt of 1991 led by KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, he led crowds to the Russian White House, center of anticoup efforts, and induced Yeltsin to address the crowds. After the coup he became an unpaid adviser to the new KGB Chairman Vadim Bakatin. While Bakatin succeeded in dismantling the old security apparatus, he did not have the time to reform it before being fired on November 1991. Ever vocal, Kalugin told the press that in the future, the KGB would have no political functions, no secret laboratories where they manufacture poisons and secret weapons. Exile in the United States. According to Kalugin, he has never betrayed any Soviet agents except those who were already known to Western intelligence. He criticized intelligence defectors like Gordievsky as ""traitors."" In 1995 he accepted a teaching position in The Catholic University of America and has remained in the United States ever since. Settling in Washington, D.C., he wrote a book about Cold War espionage entitled ""The First Directorate: My 32 Years in Intelligence and Espionage Against the West"", a more recent book ""Spymaster"" in 2008, and collaborated with former CIA Director William Colby and Activision to produce """", a CD-ROM game released in 1996. He has appeared frequently in the media and given lectures at a number of universities. In June 2001, Kalugin testified at the espionage trial of George Trofimoff, a retired Colonel of the United States Army Reserve who was charged with spying for the KGB during the 1970s and '80s. Upon being asked whether he knew the name of the U.S. military intelligence mole codenamed ""Markiz,"" Kalugin responded ""Yes. I did. His name was George Trofimoff."" Kalugin testified that Metropolitan bishop Iriney (Susemihl), the Russian Orthodox hierarch of Austria, had recruited Trofimoff into the service of the KGB. Kalugin further described having invited the Metropolitan to visit his dacha in 1978. According to Kalugin ""He did good work, particularly in recruiting Markiz. I wanted to thank him for what he had done."" Kalugin further described his own meeting with Col. Trofimoff at a location in Austria. When asked his reasons for testifying, Kalugin explained that, as a resident alien, he was trying to obey American law. After the case went to the jury, Col. Trofimoff was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. On August 4, 2003, General Kalugin became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Criticism of Putin. With the return to power of elements of the KGB, most notably Vladimir Putin, Kalugin was again accused of treason. In 2002 he was put on trial ""in absentia"" in Moscow and found guilty of spying for the West. He was sentenced to fifteen years in jail, in a verdict he described as ""Soviet justice, which is really triumphant today"". The US and Russia have no extradition treaty. Kalugin currently works for the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies (CI CENTRE) is a member of the advisory board for the International Spy Museum. He remains a critic of Vladimir Putin, a former subordinate, whom he called a ""war criminal"" over his conduct of the Second Chechen War. "

wikipedia-8639934," Amrita Bazar Patrika  Amrita Bazar Patrika was one of the oldest newspapers in India; it is published in Bengali. It debuted on 20 February 1868. It was started by Sisir Ghosh and Moti Lal Ghosh, sons of Hari Naryan Ghosh, a rich merchant from Magura, in District Jessore, in Bengal Province of British Empire in India. The family had constructed a Bazar and named it after Amritamoyee, wife of Hari Naryan Ghosh. Sisir Ghosh and Moti Lal Ghosh started ""Amrita Bazar Patrika"" as a weekly first. It was first edited by Moti Lal Ghosh, who did not have formal University Degree. The paper was popular for its honest reporting and caustic reporting. It had built its readership as a rival to ""Bengalee"" which was being looked after by Surendera Nath Banerjee. It was an English daily newspaper published from Kolkata and other locations such as Cuttack, Ranchi and Allahabad. ""Amrita Bazar Patrika"", which used to be a nationalist newspaper during the British rule, discontinued its publication from 1986. Recently it was announced that the newspaper would be relaunched. Archives. As a part of the 'Endangered Archive project' attempting to rescue text published prior to 1950, the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta took up the project of digitizing the old newspapers ""(ABP and Jugantar)"" for safe storage and retrieval in 2010. The newspaper archives are also available from the Nehru Memorial Museum & Library, Delhi, and in 2011 over one lakh images from the newspaper were digitized by the library and available online. and also at The Centre of South Asian Studies at the University of Cambridge. History. ""Amrita Bazaar Patrika"" is the oldest Indian-owned English daily. It played a major role in the evolution and growth of Indian journalism and made a striking contribution to creating and nurturing the Indian freedom struggle. In 1920, Lenin described ""ABP"" as the best nationalist paper in India. ""ABP"" was born as a Bengali weekly in February 1868 in the village of Amrita Bazaar in Jessore district (now in Bangladesh). It was started by the Ghosh brothers to fight the cause of peasants who were being exploited by indigo planters. Sisir Kumar Ghosh was the first editor. The ""Patrika"" operated out of a battered wooden press purchased for Rs 32. In 1871, the ""Patrika"" moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata), due to the outbreak of plague in Amrita Bazaar. Here it functioned as a bilingual weekly, publishing news and views in English and Bengali. Its anti-government views and vast influence among the people was a thorn in the flesh of the government. Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India promulgated the Vernacular Press Act on 1878 mainly against ABP.The Patrika became an English overnight. The ""Patrika"" became a daily in 1891. It was the first Indian-owned English daily to go into investigative journalism. During the tenure of Lord Lansdowne, a ""Patrika"" journalist rummaged through the waste paper basket of the Viceroy's office and pieced together a torn up letter detailing the Viceroy's plans to annexe Kashmir. ""ABP"" published the letter on its front page, where it was read by the Maharaja of Kashmir, who immediately went to London and lobbied for his independence. Sisir Kumar Ghosh also launched vigorous campaigns against restrictions on civil liberties and economic exploitation. He wanted Indians to be given important posts in the administration. Both he and his brother Motilal were deeply attached to Bal Gangadhar Tilak. When Tilak was prosecuted for sedition in 1897, they raised funds in Calcutta for his defence. They also published a scathing editorial against the judge who sentenced Tilak to 6 years of imprisonment, for 'presuming to teach true patriotism to a proved and unparalleled patriot.' The ""Patrika"" had many brushes with Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India at the time of the Partition of Bengal (1905). It referred to him as 'Young and a little foppish, and without previous training but invested with unlimited powers.' Because of such editorials, the Press Act of 1910 was passed and a security of Rs 5,000 was demanded from ABP. Motilal Ghosh was also charged with sedition but his eloquence won the case. After this, the ""Patrika"" started prefacing articles criticising the British government with ridiculously exuberant professions of loyalty to the British crown. When Subhas Chandra Bose and other students were expelled from Calcutta Presidency College, the ""Patrika"" took up their case and succeeded in having them re-admitted. Even after Motilal Ghosh's death in 1922, the ""Patrika"" kept up its nationalist spirit. Higher securities of Rs 10,000 were demanded from it during the Salt Satyagraha. Its editor Tushar Kanti Ghosh (son of Sisir Kumar Ghosh) was imprisoned. The ""Patrika"" contributed its share to the success of its freedom movement under the leadership of Gandhi and suffered for its views and actions at the hands of the British rulers. The ""Patrika"" espoused the cause of communal harmony during the Partition of India. During the great Calcutta killings of 1946, the ""Patrika"" left its editorial columns blank for three days. When freedom dawned on August 15, 1947, the ""Patrika"" published in an editorial: ""It is dawn, cloudy though it is. Presently sunshine will break."" "
wikipedia-996844," Labor induction  Labor induction refers to any of a number of methods for artificially stimulating childbirth. Indications. Common suggested reasons for induction include: Methods of induction. Methods of inducing labor include medication and processes. When to induce. For the health of the mother and baby labor should begin without induction whenever possible.  Non-indicated, elective inductions should not be scheduled before the 41st week of gestation unless the cervix is favorable because otherwise the mother has an increased risk of requiring a caesarean section. Doctors and patients should have a discussion of risks when considering an induction of labor when it is not medically indicated. Until recently, the most common practice has been to induce labor by the end of the 42nd week of gestation. This practice is still very common. In the UK, a dating scan is usually conducted around the 12th week of pregnancy to determine the estimated due date. Research suggests that scans done after this date can cause the estimated due date to become less accurate, with the longer time that passes. In the cases of late dating scans, the estimated due date is less accurate which could therefore provoke a woman to be induced unnecessarily. While recent studies have shown a very slightly increased risk of infant mortality for births in 41st and particularly 42nd week of gestation, as well as a slightly higher risk of injury to the mother and child. The recommended date for induction of labor has therefore been moved to the end of the 41st week of gestation in many countries including Sweden and Canada. Inducing labor before 39 weeks increases the risk of complications and premature death, from factors including underdeveloped lungs, infection due to underdeveloped immune system, problems feeding due to underdeveloped brain, and jaundice from underdeveloped liver. Some hospitals in the United States noticed a significant increase in neonatal intensive care unit patients when women schedule deliveries for convenience, and are taking steps to reduce induction for non-medical reasons. The odds of having a vaginal delivery after labor induction are assessed by a ""Bishop Score"". A Bishop Score is done to assess the progression of the cervix prior to an induction. In order to do this, the cervix must be checked to see how much it has effaced, thinned out, and how far open it is. The score goes by a points system depending on five factors. Each factor is scored on a scale between 0-3, any score that adds up to be less than 5 holds a higher risk of delivering by cesarean section. If an induction causes complications during labor, a Caesarean section is almost always conducted. An induction is most likely to result in successful vaginal delivery when a woman is close to or in the early stages of labor. Signs of impending labor may include softening of the cervix, dilation and increasing frequency or intensity of contractions. The Bishop score may be used to assess the advisability of induction, and is based on such factors. Criticisms of induction. Induced labor tends to be more painful for the woman. This can lead to the increased use of analgesics and other pain-relieving pharmaceuticals. These interventions have been said to lead to an increased likelihood of caesarean section delivery for the baby. However, studies into this matter show differing results. One study indicated that while overall caesarean section rates from 1990-1997 remained at or below 20%, elective induction was associated with a doubling of the rate of caesarean section . Two more recent studies have shown that induction may increase the risk of caesarean section if performed before the 40th week of gestation, but it has no effect or actually lowers the risk if performed after the 40th week. Research published in the Journal of Perinatal and Neonatal Nursing showed that elective induction in women who were not post-term increased a woman's chance of a C-section by two to three times. "
wikipedia-2592262," Protein subcellular localization prediction  Protein subcellular localization prediction involves the computational prediction of where a protein resides in a cell. Prediction of protein subcellular localization is an important component of bioinformatics-based prediction of protein function and genome annotation, and it can aid the identification of drug targets.  Most eukaryotic proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome and synthesized in the cytosol, but many need to be further sorted before they reach their final destination. For prokaryotes, proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and some must be targeted to other locations such as to a cell membrane or the extracellular environment. Proteins must be localized at their appropriate subcellular compartment to perform their desired function. Experimentally determining the subcellular localization of a protein is a laborious and time consuming task. Through the development of new approaches in computer science, coupled with an increased dataset of proteins of known localization, computational tools can now provide fast and accurate localization predictions for many organisms. This has resulted in subcellular localization prediction becoming one of the challenges being successfully aided by bioinformatics. Many protein subcellular localization prediction methods now exceed the accuracy of some high-throughput laboratory methods for the identification of protein subcellular localization. Particularly, some predictors developed recently can be used to deal with proteins that may simultaneously exist, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. Methods. Several computational tools for predicting the subcellular localization of a protein are publicly available, a few of which are listed below. The development of protein subcellular location prediction has been summarized in two comprehensive review articles. Also, the predictors were specialized for proteins in different organisms. Some was specialized for eukaryotic proteins, some for human proteins,  and some for plant proteins. Methods for the prediction of bacterial localization predictors, and their accuracy, have been recently reviewed. Application. Determining subcellular localization is important for understanding protein function and is a critical step in genome annotation.  Knowledge of the subcellular localization of a protein can significantly improve target identification during the drug discovery process. For example, secreted proteins and plasma membrane proteins are easily accessible by drug molecules due to their localization in the extracellular space or on the cell surface.  Bacterial cell surface and secreted proteins are also of interest for their potential as vaccine candidates or as diagnostic targets.  Aberrant subcellular localization of proteins has been observed in the cells of several diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease.  Secreted proteins from some archaea that can survive in unusual environments have industrially important applications. "
wikipedia-6204230," History of the United States Coast Guard  The history of the United States Coast Guard goes back to the Revenue Cutter Service, which was founded on 4 August 1790 as part of the Department of the Treasury. The Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service were merged to become the Coast Guard per which states: ""The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times."" In 1939, the United States Lighthouse Service was merged into the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard itself was moved to the Department of Transportation in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the Department of Homeland Security. However, under as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when Congress so directs in the declaration, or when the President directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Department of the Navy. Early history. The Coast Guard's predecessor service, the Revenue Cutter Service, was founded 4 August 1790, when the Tariff Act permitted construction of ten cutters and recruitment of 100 revenue officers. From 1790, when the Continental Navy was disbanded, to 1798, when the United States Navy was created, the Revenue Cutter Service provided the only armed American presence on the sea. Revenue Marine cutters were involved in the Quasi-War with France from 1798 to 1799, the War of 1812, and the Mexican-American War. Another predecessor service, the U.S. Lighthouse Service, was organized by statute in 1910. The predecessor to the Lighthouse Service was the United States Lighthouse Board established in 1852. In 1794, the Revenue Cutter Service was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President Thomas Jefferson's embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The Coast Guard's role in environmental protection dates back more than 185 years to the 1822 Timber Act that tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers. During the American Civil War, the Revenue Service cutter ""Harriet Lane"" fired the first shots of the war at sea at the steamer ""Nashville"" during the siege of Fort Sumter. A Confederate Revenue Marine was formed by crewmen who left the Revenue Cutter Service. Upon the order of President Lincoln to the Secretary of the Treasury on 14 June 1863, Federal cutters were assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In the 1880s through the 1890s, the Revenue Cutter Service was instrumental in the development of Alaska. Captain ""Hell Roaring"" Michael A. Healy, captain of the USRC ""Bear"", greatly assisted a program that brought reindeer to Alaska to provide a steady food source. Healy had the reputation as a rough sailing master and was court-martialed several times, but was restored to rank again and again. In the winter of 1897–1898, the reindeer and lieutenants in the Revenue Cutter Service participated in the Overland Relief Expedition to help starving trapped whalers. During the Snake River gold rush of 1900, the Revenue Cutter Service returned destitute miners to Seattle from Alaska. The Coast Guard took its unofficial motto, ""You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,"" from the 1899 regulations of the United States Life Saving Service, which stated: These regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations. Coast Guard Academy. The School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the USRC ""Dobbin"" for its training exercises. It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects. In 1903, the third year of instruction was added. The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life. In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the United States Coast Guard Academy. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932. Birth of the modern Coast Guard. In 1915, the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life-saving Service were merged to form the Coast Guard. The Lighthouse Service was merged into the Coast Guard in 1939. On 28 February 1942, the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1920 the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce held hearings on merging the recently created Coast Guard into the United States Navy. World War I. Preparation. The Coast Guard's preparations for the coming war actually started before the Declaration of War on 6 April 1917. In late 1916, the Interdepartmental Board on Coast Communications recommended that telephone communications be improved and brought to a high state of readiness all along the U.S. coastline to include lighthouses and lifesaving stations as well as other government coastal facilities. Sensing a need for aviation, the Coast Guard sent Third Lieutenant Elmer Stone to Naval Flight Training on 21 March 1916. On 22 March 1917 the Commandant issued a twelve page manual titled ""Confidential Order No. 2, Mobilization of the U.S. Coast Guard When Required to Operate as a Part of the U.S. Navy"". Germany had already announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, on all ships trading with its enemies and included neutral shipping as targets. U.S. merchant ships sunk before a declaration of war included the SS ""Healdton and the SS ""Housatonic"" and five others with the loss of 36 American lives. Declaration of war. On 6 April, with a formal declaration of war, the Coast Guard was transferred to the operational control of the Navy. All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders. All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed. At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy. The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service. Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war. A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent. There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay. Coast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy. The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience. The 1920s. Prohibition. In the 1920s, the Coast Guard was given several former U.S. Navy four-stack destroyers to help enforce Prohibition. The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers. However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and petty officers with operational experience which proved invaluable in World War II. The Navy's epithet of ""Hooligan Navy"" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service. 1927 Mississippi River flood. During the disastrous 1927 Mississippi River flood, the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they “removed from perilous positions to places of safety"". Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization. In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations. The 1930s. Increasing regulation of merchant shipping. The Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932. In 1934, the passenger vessel ""SS Morro Castle"" suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew. The casualty prompted new fire protection standards for vessels and paved the way for the ""Act of May 27, 1936"", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. Marine inspection and navigation duties under the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946. Carl von Paulsen rescue. Lieutenant Commander Carl von Paulsen set the seaplane ""Arcturus"" in a heavy sea in January 1933 off Cape Canaveral and rescued a boy adrift in a skiff. The aircraft sustained so much damage during the open water landing that it could not take off. Ultimately, ""Arcturus"" washed onto the beach and all including the boy were saved. Commander Paulsen was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for this rescue. The 1940s. World War II. Before the American entry into World War II, cutters of the Coast Guard patrolled the North Atlantic. In January 1940 President Roosevelt directed the establishment of the Atlantic Weather Observation Service using Coast Guard cutters and U.S. Weather Bureau observers. After the invasion of Denmark by Germany in April 1940, President Roosevelt ordered the International Ice Patrol to continue as a legal pretext to patrol Greenland, whose cryolite mines were vital to refining aluminum and whose geographic location allowed accurate weather forecasts to be made for Europe. The Greenland patrol was maintained by the Coast Guard for the duration of the war. The , was peripherally involved in the chase and sinking of the German battleship ""Bismarck"". Shortly after Germany declared war on the United States, German submarines began Operation Drumbeat ""(""Paukenschlag""),"" sinking ships off the American coast. Many Coast Guard cutters were involved in rescue operations following German attacks on American shipping. The , a 165-foot (50 m) cutter that previously had been a rumrunner chaser during Prohibition, sank ""U-352"" on 9 May 1942, off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina, and took 33 prisoners, the first Germans taken in combat by any U.S. force. The sank ""U-157"" on 10 June 1942. During the war, Coast Guard units sank 12 German and two Japanese submarines and captured two German surface vessels. When the rammed and sank the German U-606, her enlisted mascot Sinbad became a public hero at home and brought attention to the role of the Coast Guard in convoy protection. Coast Guardsmen also patrolled the shores of the United States during the war. On 13 June 1942 Seaman 2nd Class John Cullen, patrolling the beach in Amagansett, New York, discovered the first landing of German saboteurs in Operation Pastorius. Cullen was the first American who actually came in contact with the enemy on the shores of the United States during the war and his report led to the capture of the German sabotage team. For this, Cullen received the Legion of Merit. [http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/cb/PDFs/Sept_2005.pdf]. The Coast Guard had 30 Edsall class destroyer escorts under its command that were used primarily for convoy escort duty in the Atlantic. In addition to antisubmarine operations, the Coast Guard worked closely with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Many of the coxswains of American landing craft, such as the Higgins boat (LCVP), used in amphibious invasions were Coast Guardsmen who had received amphibious training with the cooperation of the U.S. Marine Corps. Coast Guard cutters and ships partially manned by Coast Guardsmen were used in the North African invasion of November 1942 (Operation Torch) and the invasion of Sicily in 1943 (Operation Husky). On 9 September 1942 the USCGC ""Muskget"" (WAG-48) was sunk with a loss of 121 crewmembers while on North Atlantic weather patrol by U-755. In November 1942, legislation was passed creating the Coast Guard Women's Reserve, also known as the SPARS. Led by Captain Dorothy C. Stratton, around 11,000 women served in various stateside positions, freeing men for overseas duty. During the Normandy invasion of 6 June 1944, a 60-cutter flotilla of wooden WPB 83-foot (25 m) Coast Guard cutters, nicknamed the ""Matchbox Fleet"", cruised off all five landing beaches as combat search-and-rescue boats, saving 400 Allied airmen and sailors. Division O-1, including the Coast Guard-manned , landed the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division on Omaha Beach. Off Utah Beach, the Coast Guard manned the command ship . Several Coast Guard-manned landing craft were lost during D-Day to enemy fire and heavy seas. In addition, a cutter was beached during the storms off the Normandy coast which destroyed the U.S.-operated Mulberry harbor. The , a notable World War II era high endurance cutter, is the only warship still afloat today (as a museum ship in Baltimore) that was present for the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, although she was actually stationed in nearby Honolulu. On 27 August 1944, the all Coast Guard-manned was torpedoed–but not sunk–by while crossing the English Channel. 22 Coast Guardsmen were killed. On 12 September 1944, the Liberty ship ""George Ade"" was torpedoed by a German U-boat off Cape Hatteras, N.C. and , heading to assist the survivors of the ""Ade"", were caught in the Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944 the day after, sinking both cutters and killing 48 Coast Guardsmen. A U.S. Navy seaplane rescued the survivors. On 29 January 1945, the , a Coast Guard-manned Liberty ship, exploded off Guadalcanal, Solomons Islands, while loading depth charges. 193 Coast Guardsmen, 56 Army stevedores, and one U.S. Public Health Service officer were killed in the explosion. This was the biggest single disaster to befall the Coast Guard during the war. As was common during this period, many of Hollywood's able-bodied screen stars became enlistees and left their film careers on hiatus in order to support the national defense. Specifically, actors Gig Young, Cesar Romero, and Richard Cromwell all served admirably in various capacities in the USCG in the Pacific for several years. The A&P heir Huntington Hartford also served in the Pacific as a commander. Douglas Munro. Signalman 1st Class Douglas Munro (1919–1942), the only Coast Guardsman to receive the Medal of Honor, earned the decoration during World War II as a small boat coxswain during the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. A Navy destroyer escort, , was named in his honor in 1944. The cutter was commissioned in 1971, and is still on active service. Bermuda Sky Queen rescue. On 14 October 1947, the American-owned Boeing 314 flying boat ""Bermuda Sky Queen"", carrying sixty-nine passengers was flying from Foynes, Ireland to Gander, Newfoundland. Gale force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel. Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward which was on Ocean Station Charlie in the North Atlantic. The plane’s captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ""Bibb"". In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous. Initially the ""Bibb’s"" captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter. A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers. With worsening weather, a fifteen man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship. The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft. Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat. After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue’s suspension. By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ""Bibb"". The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ""Bibb"" and her crew received a hero’s welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ""Bermuda Sky Queen"". This event spurred ratification of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) treaty establishing a network of ocean weather stations in 1947. A second conference in 1949 reduced the number of Atlantic stations to ten but provided for three Pacific stations. Enlisted training center. An enlisted training center was established in Cape May in 1948 and all recruit training functions were consolidated in this facility in 1982, when the West Coast recruit center at Government Island (Alameda), California was closed, the facility repurposed and the island renamed. (See Coast Guard Island). The 1950s. Korean War. During the Korean War, Coast Guard officers helped arrange the evacuation of the Korean Peninsula during the initial North Korean attack. On 9 August 1950, Congress enacted Public Law 679, known as the Magnuson Act. This act charged the Coast Guard with ensuring the security of the United States' ports and harbors on a permanent basis. In addition, the Coast Guard established a series of weather ships in the north Pacific Ocean and assisted civilian and military aircraft and ships in distress, and established a string of LORAN stations in Japan and Korea that assisted the United Nations forces. ""Pendleton"" rescue. On 18 February 1952, during a severe ""nor’easter"" off the New England coast, the T2 tankers SS ""Fort Mercer"" and SS ""Pendleton"" broke in half. ""Pendleton"" was unable to make any distress call; she was discovered on the unusual shore radar with which the Chatham, Massachusetts, Lifeboat Station was equipped during the search for ""Fort Mercer"". BM1 Bernard C. Webber, coxswain of motor lifeboat ""CG-36500"" from Station Chatham and his crew, consisting of Andrew Fitzgerald, Richard Livesey, and Ervin Maske, rescued the crew of ""Pendleton"", which had broken in half. Webber maneuvered the 36-footer under ""Pendleton""s stern with expert skill as the tanker's crew, trapped in the stern section, abandoned the remains of their ship on a Jacob's ladder. One by one, the men jumped into the water and then were pulled into the lifeboat. Webber and his crew saved 33 of the 34 ""Pendleton"" crewmen. Webber, Fitzgerald, Livesey, and Maske were awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for their heroic actions. In all, U .S. Coast Guard vessels, aircraft, and lifeboat stations, working under severe winter conditions, rescued 62 persons from the foundering ships or from the water; only five lives were lost among the crews of ""Fort Mercer"" and ""Pendleton"". Five Coast Guardsmen earned the Gold Lifesaving Medal, four earned the Silver Lifesaving Medal, and 15 earned the Coast Guard Commendation Medal. The rescue of men from the bow of ""Fort Mercer"" was nearly as spectacular as the ""Pendleton"" rescue, but is often overshadowed by the ""Pendleton"" rescue. Eight officers and crew were trapped on the bow of ""Fort Mercer"" and four were rescued using rafts and a Monomoy surfboat. By contrast, all aboard the bow of the ""Pendleton"" perished. The 1960s. Transfer to the Department of Transportation. On 1 April 1967 the Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of the Treasury to the newly formed Department of Transportation under the authority of PL 89-670 which was signed into law on 15 October 1966. The Racing Stripe. In 1967, the Coast Guard adopted the red and blue ""racing stripe"" as part of the regular insignia for cutters, boats, and aircraft. It was recommended by the industrial design firm of Raymond Loewy/William Snaith, Inc. to give Coast Guard units and vessels a distinctive appearance, as well as clearer recognition from a distance. This ""racing stripe"" was in turn adopted (in modified forms) by several other coast guards, in particular the Canadian Coast Guard. Vietnam War. The Coast Guard was active in the Vietnam War beginning 27 May 1965 with the formation of Coast Guard Squadron One consisting of Divisions 11 and 12. Squadron One assisted in Operation Market Time by interdicting resupply by sea of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces. Seventeen ""Point class"" 82-foot WPB cutters were transferred to coastal waters off Vietnam with their Coast Guard crews under the operational control of the U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet. Division 13, consisting of nine additional WPB's was added in February 1966. Squadron One cutters were awarded the Navy Presidential Unit Citation for their assistance provided the Navy during Operation Sealords. Coast Guard Squadron Three was activated in support of Market Time beginning March 1967 and consisted initially of five high endurance cutters (WHEC) tasked to the Navy for used in coastal interdiction and naval gunfire support for shore operations in South Vietnam. The Coast Guard developed a ""piggyback"" weapon that proved highly useful; an M2 Browning machine gun placed over a 81mm mortar. Several Coast Guard aviators served with the U.S. Air Force 37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron and 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron in Southeast Asia from 1968 to 1972. They were involved in combat search and rescue operations in both Vietnam and Laos.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/KaliszThomasCGAviationVTN.pdf] The Coast Guard provided Explosive Loading Detachments (ELD) to the U.S. Army 1st Logistics Command in several locations in Vietnam. The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam (USARV). They earned the Army Meritorious Unit Commendation for their efforts. In December 1965 Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of LORAN-C stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia. Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and were operational after 8 August 1966. On 22 April 1966, arrived in Cam Rahn Bay to commence Aids to Navigation (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam. She was responsible for the marking of freshly cut channels and harbors with buoys and daymarks so that merchant and naval ships could safely navigate the waters. This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, . The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ""Blackhaw"" as a part of the 'Vietnamization' policy of the Nixon Administration. After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by homeported in Guam. In August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One. The training of South Vietnamese crews had started in February 1969 and continued through to the end of operations for Squadron One. and were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 1 January 1971. Eventually three other WHEC's were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy. The Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War ended at 1246 local time 29 April 1975 when LORAN Station Con Son went off the air for good. Its signal was necessary for the safe evacuation of Siagon by U.S. Embassy personnel in the final days before the fall of the South Vietnamese government and it was kept on the air as long as possible. On 3 October 1975 the Coast Guard disestablished the remaining LORAN-C stations in Thailand. Seven Coast Guardsmen were killed during the war in combat and search and rescue operations. The 1970s. The ""New Guard"". In the mid-70s the Coast Guard adopted the blue uniforms seen today, replacing Navy-style uniforms worn prior to the Vietnam War. Known jocularly as ""Bender's Blues,"" they were implemented as part of the postwar transition to an all-volunteer force. It is noteworthy that the enlisted's and officer's uniforms differed ""only"" in rank insignia and cap devices, reflecting the value the service placed on its enlisted members (although it caused saluting confusion among members of other services). The stylish new women's uniform was created by Hollywood costume designer Edith Head, upon the request of Capt. Eleanor L'Ecuyer. Enlisted uniform buttons were gold while officer's buttons were silver. This was just opposite of most military services. Women were integrated into the Coast Guard during the 1970s, beginning with the end of the separate Women's Reserve (SPARS) in 1973, the modification of 378's for mixed-gender crews beginning in 1977, and the opening of all ratings to women in 1978. These stages of integration preceded the DOD military by roughly a year or so, as separate legislation restricted their deployment of women.  Altogether, the shift from Treasury to the DOT in 1967, the uniform change, the end of Ocean Station service, growth of the shore-side establishment by newly added missions, the steady if belated retirement of venerable but aging World War II cutters, and gender integration marked the oft-lamented end of the ""Old Guard"" (""wooden ships and men of steel""). The Ancient Order of the Pterodactyl was founded in 1977 in order to preserve the history of Coast Guard aviation, as the service's last amphibious seaplane, the Grumman Albatross or ""Goat,"" was nearing retirement, as was also the service's last enlisted pilot, John P. Greathouse. End of ocean stations, beginning of the limit. One major mission of the service, maintaining Ocean Stations, came to an end as improvements in oceanic aviation (turbojet airliners and improved radionavigation) obviated the need. However, the Magnuson–Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976 brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired. The Kudirka incident. On 23 November 1970, Simonas ""Simas"" Kudirka, a Soviet seaman of Lithuanian nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120 m) mother ship ""Sovetskaya Litva"", anchored in American waters (near Aquinnah, Massachusetts on Martha's Vineyard Island), aboard the USCGC ""Vigilant"", sailing from New Bedford. The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe. Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a ""blind spot"" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator. After attempts to get the U.S. State Department to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis (1914–2001), commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a KGB detachment to board the ""Vigilant"" to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship. This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ. Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive letter of reprimand and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in the Gulag. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and was allowed to come to the United States in 1974. The incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's ""Day of Shame,"" was portrayed in a 1976 television movie, ""The Defection of Simas Kudirka"", with Alan Arkin playing Kudirka and Donald Pleasence playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ""Decisive"" playing the part of USCGC ""Vigilant"". It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ""Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard"" by Algis Ruksenas. The 1980s. The ""Blackthorn"" Tragedy. On 28 January 1980, the 180-ft buoy tender ""USCGC Blackthorn (WLB-391)"" collided with the 605-foot oil tanker ""S.S. Capricorn"" and capsized when the ""Capricorn'""s anchor entangled the cutter. 23 Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship USCGC ""Cuyahoga""(built in 1927 as a Prohibition patrol boat [http://www.uscg.mil/history/WEBCUTTERS/Cuyahoga1927.html), the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified. ""Prinsendam"" rescue. On 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel in the Gulf of Alaska. A fire broke out on the ""Prinsendam"" off Ketchikan, Alaska on 4 October 1980. The ""Prinsendam"" was from the nearest airstrip. The cruise ship’s captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats. Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ""Boutwell"", ""Mellon"", and ""Woodrush"" responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank. The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury. The Mariel boatlift. In April 1980, the government of Cuba began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in Mariel Harbor and take their own transport. The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees. This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials. By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and Key West, and the Auxiliary was heavily involved. 125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See Mariel boatlift.) The end of the lightships. The number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by ""Texas Tower"" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html, and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554. The technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF OMEGA Navigation System and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS). Libyan attack on LORAN station Lampedusa. On 15 April 1986, Libya fired two Scuds at the U.S. Coast Guard navigation station on the Italian island of Lampedusa, in retaliation for the American bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby. At the time of the missile attack, the LORAN station was under the command of Lt. Ernest DelBueno, who panicked and attempted to evacuate his American crew by calling in a U.S. Navy transport helicopter from Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Four (HC-4), abandoning the Italians on his base, and in the community on the other end of the island. To their credit, the Italians, under the leadership of the base's civilian administrator, Marco Bartolo, reflected great honor as they kept their posts; however, the incident damaged relations with the local Italians; a rift that remained for more than two years. Exxon Valdez oil spill. In March 1989, the oil tanker ""Exxon Valdez"" struck Prince William Sound's Bligh Reef and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil.Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities related to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the Federal On-Scene Coordinator between Exxon Mobil and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the Clean Water Act. Coast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken Exxon Valdez. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April, and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May, and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later – and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response. Several C-130s from Air Station Kodiak airlifted more than 11 ¼ tons of clean up equipment by 10 April 1989. H-25 Falcon jets from CGAS Cape Cod, flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf] The 1990s. '90 Operation Desert Shield. On 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to Operation Desert Shield. A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces. Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs. Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater. The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield. Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history. A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty. '91 Operation Desert Storm. Prior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991. On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of Mina Ash Shuwaikh in Kuwait City. Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with M2 and M60 machine guns, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation. During the war, Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan. Operation Buckshot, ""The Great Flood of '93"". During April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces, St. Louis was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF, St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 HP outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, MI; Chicago, IL; Elizabeth City, NC; and Mobile, AL provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CG Forces St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard Civilians were involved in the operation. 1994 Cuban boat rescues. In 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts. The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters—half the complement of the Coast Guard—were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 1999 Kosovo. In the summer of 1999, USCGC Bear (WMEC-901) deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of Operation Allied Force and Operation Noble Anvilwithin the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ""bear"" also provided U.S. Army vessel's transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took Bear up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface to surface missile range.Bear earned the Kosovo Campaign Medal,and the NATO Kosovo Medal.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf] The 2000s. Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Homeland Security on 1 March 2003 under the Homeland Security Act (Public Law No. 107-296). In September 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld rejected the proposal to transfer all military responsibilities of the Coast Guard to the Navy and assigning the Coast Guard purely homeland security responsibilities. In 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the Persian Gulf to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from Iraq. Port Security Units and Naval Coastal Warfare units also accompanied the U.S. military buildup. Operation Iraqi Freedom. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Coast Guard had deployed its largest contingent of Coast Guardsmen and assets overseas since the Vietnam War, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Coast Guard Cutters primarily assisted in force protection and search and seizures of suspected smugglers close to the Iraq-Iran border. The Coast Guard also sent the Port Advisory Coordination Element to Iraq in order for the Government of Iraq to maintain compliance with international Shipping and Port Facility Security standards and requirements. inspected the poor condition and position of navigational aids, such as buoys, and then replaced or corrected the aids to navigation in order to allow for the safe navigation of the Khor Abd Allah River flowing up to Umm Qasr for military, humanitarian and commercial vessels. On 24 April 2004, Petty Officer 3rd Class Nathan B. Bruckenthal, 24, from the USS Firebolt (PC-10), became the first Coast Guardsman to die in combat since the Vietnam War. He was killed in a suicide boat attack on a Basra oil terminal off the coast of Iraq. With his death, all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces had seen at least one death in that war. At the height of the conflict, the Coast Guard deployed over 1,200 men and women,including about 500 reservists, 11 ships(two large cutters, a buoy tender, eight patrol boats) 4 port-security units, a law enforcement detachments and support staff to the Central (CENTCOM) and European (EUCOM) Command to the theater to conduct maritime interception operations and coastal security patrols in Iraq and Kuwait. During Operation New Dawn, Coast Guard Reserve units have deployed to the Middle East. The Coast Guard is charged with providing harbor defense and security to ports, seaward approaches, and waterways within U.S. Central Command’s area of responsibility and ensuring the free flow of personnel, equipment and commerce in the region. Operation Enduring Freedom. During Operation Enduring Freedom, The Coast Guard provided Redeployment Assistance and Inspection Detachment(RAID) units. The RAID units assisted U.S. Army and Marine units with the proper declaration, classification, labeling and packaging of container shipments as well as the inspection of containers for structural integrity to ensure each one is seaworthy to cut down on potential shipping problems., thus becoming the most forward deployed Coast Guard unit in a combat zone. Hurricane Katrina. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the Coast Guard dispatched a number of helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, small boats, and Auxiliary aircraft as well as 25 cutters to the Gulf Coast, rescuing 2,000 people in two days, and around 33,500 people in all. The crews also assessed storm damage to offshore oil platforms and refineries. More than 2,400 personnel from all districts conducted search, rescue, response, waterway reconstitution and environmental impact assessment operations. In total, the Coast Guard air and boat rescued more than 33,500 people and assisted with the joint-agency evacuation of an additional 9,400 patients and medical personnel from hospitals in the Gulf coast region. In May 2006, at the Change of Command ceremony when Admiral Thad Allen took over as Commandant, President George W. Bush awarded the entire Coast Guard, including the Coast Guard Auxiliary, the Presidential Unit Citation for its efforts after Hurricane Katrina. On 29 October 2009 Coast Guard HC-130 aircraft No. 1705 with seven crewmembers, based at McClellan Air Park in Sacramento, collided with a United States Marine Corps (USMC) AH-1 Cobra helicopter with two crewmembers east of San Clemente Island. Both aircraft crashed into the ocean and all nine crewmembers in both aircraft are believed to have perished. The C-130 was searching for a missing boater while the USMC aircraft was heading towards a military training area in company with another Cobra and two CH-53 Sea Stallions from Miramar Naval Air Station. An investigation found no one directly responsible for the crash. The 2010s. CG-6535 crash. A U.S. Coast Guard MH-65C Dolphin helicopter with 4 crew members on board crashed 28 Feb 2012 into Mobile Bay, Alabama. The helicopter was on a training mission out of U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center Mobile. Future. The Integrated Deepwater System Program is designed to meet future threats to the U.S. from the sea. Although the program involves obtaining new ships and aircraft, Deepwater also involves upgraded information technology for command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR). A key part of the Deepwater system is the Maritime Security Cutter, Large (WMSL), which is designed to replace the 378-foot (115 m) high-endurance cutters currently on duty. This ship will have a length of 421 feet (128 m), be powered by a gas turbine engine with two auxiliary diesel engines, and be capable of 12,000 nautical mile (22,000 km) voyages lasting up to 60 days. The keel laying of the USCGC Bertholf (WMSL-750), the first ship in this class, took place in September 2004. The ship was delivered in 2008. The second keel, USCGC Waesche (WMSL-751), was laid in 2005. Another key vessel is the Maritime Security Cutter, Medium (WMSM), which will be 341 ft (104 m) long, displace 2,921 long tons (2,968 metric tons), and be capable of 45-day patrols of up to 9,000 nautical miles (17,000 km). Both the WMSL and the WMSM cutters will be able to carry two helicopters or four VTOL Unmanned Air Vehicles (VUAVs), or a combination of these. "

wikipedia-1079941," Metal Mickey  Metal Mickey was a five-foot-tall robot (created, controlled and voiced by Johnny Edward), as well as the name of a spin-off television show starring the same character. A modernised vision of a 1950s space toy, Metal Mickey first appeared on British television in the ITV children's magazine show ""The Saturday Banana,"" produced by Southern Television in 1978. Humphrey Barclay saw Mickey on Jimmy Savile's 'Jim'll Fix It' television show. Seeing the children chatting in the marketplace with the friendly robot, this led to the creation of the ""Metal Mickey"" television show. Within a month the pilot had been video-taped and shortly after this the series went live with its first six episodes. 41 episodes were made in all, attracting around 12 million viewers. (Jictar rating) Micky Dolenz, formerly of The Monkees pop group, was brought in to produce and direct along with Nic Phillips and David Crossman. ""Metal Mickey"" television show. The television show was created under LWT's Humphrey Barclay who described ""Metal Mickey"" as a show ""with the appeal of ""Star Wars, the Daleks"" and ""Mork and Mindy"""" It ran from 1980 to 1983.  The series was set in the home of an ordinary British family, whose youngest child was a science boffin, who had created Metal Mickey to help around the home. The family consisted of a mother and father, three children and a grandmother. The show was made by London Weekend Television and shown on the ITV network, with the entire run of 41 episodes being written by comedy writer Colin Bostock-Smith. British comedy actress Irene Handl played the grandmother, whom Mickey affectionately called ""my little fruitbat"". He also referred to his inventor as ""Clever Clogs"", his inventor's sister as ""Stringbean"" and their father as ""Bootface"". Handl was never at home with science fiction, either watching it or appearing in it. She famously told BBC presenter Noel Edmonds, when he asked her whether she cried over the death of E.T., ""Why should I cry over a bleedin' Hoover attachment?"" Metal Mickey's catchphrase was ""boogie, boogie"", and his favourite treat was Atomic Thunderbusters (which had the appearance of lemon bonbons). DVD releases. The first two series of ""Metal Mickey"" have been released on DVD. The third series was due to be released in mid-2009. "

wikipedia-2907581," Australian Kriol language  Kriol is an Australian creole language that developed from a pidgin used initially in the region of Sydney and Newcastle in New South Wales in the early days of White colonisation, and that then moved west and north with White and Black stockmen. The pidgin died out in most parts of the country, except in the Northern Territory, where the contact between European settlers, Chinese and other Asians and the indigenous people in the northern regions of Australia has maintained a vibrant use of the language. It is presently spoken by about 30,000 people. Despite the language's similarities to English in vocabulary, it has a distinct syntactic structure and grammar, and is, therefore, a language in its own right. History. European settlement in the Northern Territory was attempted over a period of about forty years. Settlement finally succeeded in 1870, and an influx of both English and Chinese speakers followed. In order to communicate between these two groups and the local Aboriginal people, pidgins developed throughout the territory based on Port Jackson Pidgin English. By 1900, Northern Territory Pidgin English (NTPE) was widespread and well understood. NTPE creolised first in the Roper River Mission (Ngukurr), where cattle stations were established and a township developed. During this period, the relations between the native and European peoples were strained. Aboriginal people fiercely defended their lands. However, the control of lands was eventually seized by the settlers when a cattle company acquired much of the area. The settlers became more determined to take full control of the land from the native people, and carried out a campaign to do so. The resettlements and land seizures nearly annihilated the indigenous population, and also provided one major factor in the development of the creole: drastic social change accompanied by severe communication difficulties. The second requirement for the development of the creole was a new community, which came about when Anglican missionaries set up a refuge in the Roper River region in 1908. This brought together around 200 people from 8 different aboriginal ethnic groups, who spoke different native languages. Although the adults were multilingual, due to frequent meetings and ceremonies, the children had yet to acquire their native language skills, so they used the only common language they had: the NTPE. In their lifetime, these children were almost totally responsible for developing the pidgin into a full language. Although the relations between the missionaries and Aboriginal people were friendly, the missions were not responsible for the development of Kriol. In fact, they tried to introduce Standard English as the official language for the mission, and although the Aboriginal children used this language in class, and with the missionaries, Kriol flourished. Kriol was not formally recognised as a language until the 1970s, as it was regarded as a dialect of English rather than a language in its own right. Varieties of Kriol. Kriol is very widely spoken in the Katherine area, but there are minor differences between the varieties of Kriol spoken in particular areas, and certain speakers of Kriol prefer to refer to their language by their unique name. However, linguistically the varieties are quite similar. Debate is ongoing about whether the varieties should be named differently, to highlight their different social significance, or whether they should all be lumped into one big category of Kriol. The differences are not actually that large: Mari Rhydwen compares the distinction to the distinction between American and British English. Roper River (Ngukurr) Kriol is also spoken in Barunga, and in the Daly River area they speak a variety that is mutually intelligible, but Daly River speakers do not consider themselves to be Kriol speakers. There is the question of whether the varieties should be understood as different forms of Kriol to strengthen the identities of the respective regions; or whether they all should be seen as Kriol, and potentially have a better chance of funding for bilingual education programs. Ngukurr Kriol example text can be found here: http://ewh.ieee.org/r10/nsw/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=59 Kriol Bible translation. On 5 May 2007, the first complete edition of the Bible in the Kriol language was officially launched at Katherine in the Northern Territory. Translation took over 29 years, and was undertaken by a team of native Kriol speakers led by Rev. Canon Gumbuli Wurrumara and specialists from the Society for Australian Indigenous Languages. The Kriol Bible is the first complete edition of the Bible in any indigenous Australian language. The publication was a joint venture of The Bible Society, Lutheran Bible Translators, The Church Missionary Society, the Anglican church, Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Australian Society of Indigenous Languages. Dialects. Dialects of the Kriol includes Roper River Kriol (Roper River Pidgin), Bamyili Creole, Barkly Kriol, Fitzroy Valley Kriol, and Daly River Kriol. Current issues. A problem facing many communities in Northern Australia is that creole-speaking children are treated as though they speak English, but speak it badly; so they do not receive education in English as a second language. On the other hand, because they are not regarded as having a native mother tongue, they are denied access to education in their traditional language. The only official bilingual language program in Kriol is at Barunga, which was established during the Whitlam government, and has successfully included Kriol as both a medium and object of study. Funding is scarce for any further development of programs. Although Kriol is widely spoken, its literal translation is minimal, with the exception of the Bible. This means that literacy rates of Kriol are quite low. Apart from practical implications of this, especially if English literacy is also low (i.e. written communication, education opportunities), it means that traditional stories are either not recorded in written form, or the Ngukurr people must rely on texts from Barunga, which may lessen the identity distinction between the two groups. However, Aboriginal cultures are not traditionally rooted in written records, so the lack of written versions of texts may be a function of the oral nature of Aboriginal storytelling. "
wikipedia-1015057," Honorific  An honorific title is a word or expression with connotations conveying esteem or respect when used in addressing or referring to a person. Sometimes, the term ""honorific"" is used in a more specific sense to refer to an honorary academic title. It is also often conflated with systems of honorific speech in linguistics, which are grammatical or morphological ways of encoding the relative social status of speakers. Typically, honorifics are used as a style in the grammatical third person, and as a form of address in the second person. Use in the first person, by the honored dignitary, is uncommon. Some languages have anti-honorific (""despective"" or ""humilific"") first person forms (expressions such as ""your most humble servant"" or ""this unworthy person"") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded to the person addressed. Modern English honorifics. The most common honorifics in modern English are usually placed immediately before a person's name. Honorifics which can be used (both as style and as form of address) include, in the case of a male, ""Mr"" (irrespective of marital status), and in the case of a female the honorific will depend on her marital status: if the female is unmarried, it is ""Miss, if she is married it is ""Mrs"", and if her marital status is unknown, or it is not desired to specify it, ""Ms.""  Other honorifics may denote the honored person’s occupation, for instance ""Doctor"", ""Captain"", ""Coach"", Officer, ""Reverend"" for all clergy and/or ""Father"" (for a Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, or Anglican Christian priest), or ""Professor"". Holders of an academic Doctorate such as PhD are addressed as ""Doctor"" (abbreviated Dr). ""Master"" as a prefix ahead of the name of boys and young men up to about 16 years of age is less common than it used to be, but is still used by older people addressing the young in formal situations and correspondence. Some honorifics act as complete replacements for a name, as ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"", or ""Your Honor"". Subordinates will often use honorifics as punctuation before asking a superior a question or after responding to an order: ""Yes, Sir"" or even ""Sir, yes Sir."" Judges are often addressed as ""Your Honor"" (or ""Honour"") when on the bench, and the style is ""His/Her Honor"" the plural form is ""Your Honors"". If the judge also has a higher title, that may be the correct honorific to use: ""Your Lordship"". Similarly, a monarch (ranking as a king or emperor) and his consort may be addressed or referred to as ""Your/His/Her Majesty"", ""Their Majesties"", etc. (but there is no customary honorific accorded to a female monarch's consort, as he is usually granted a specific style). Monarchs below kingly rank are addressed as ""Your/His/Her Highness"", the exact rank being indicated by an appropriate modifier, e.g. ""His Serene Highness"" for a member of a princely dynasty, or ""Her Grand Ducal Highness"" for a member of a family that reigns over a grand duchy. Verbs with these honorifics as subject are conjugated in the third person (e.g. ""you are going"" vs. ""Your Honor is going"" or ""Her Royal Highness is going"".) Protocol for monarchs and aristocrats can be very complex, with no general rule; great offence can be given by using a form that is not exactly correct. There are vital difference between ""Your Highness"" and ""Your Royal Highness""; between ""Princess Margaret"" and ""The Princess Margaret"". All of these are correct, but apply to people of subtly different rank. An example of a non-obvious style is ""Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother"", which is an official style, but unique to one person. In music, a distinguished conductor or virtuoso instrumentalist may be known as ""Maestro"". In aviation, pilots in command of a larger civil aircraft are usually addressed as ""Captain"" plus their full name or surname. This tradition is slowly diminishing in the United States and most EU countries. However, many countries, especially in Asia, follow this tradition and address airline pilots, military pilots, and flight instructors exclusively as ""Captain"" even outside of the professional environment. In addition, such countries' etiquette rules dictate to place this title on all the official letters and social invitations, business cards, identification documents, etc. In the United States, when addressing a pilot, common etiquette does not require the title ""Captain"" to be printed on official letters or invitations before the addressee's full name. However, this is optional (akin to ""Esq"" after a man's name (used only by lawyers in the USA)) and may be used where appropriate, especially when addressing airline pilots with many years of experience. Occupants of state and political office may be addressed with an honorific. A monarch may be addressed as His/Her Majesty, a president as Your Excellency or Mr/Madam President, a minister or secretary of state as ""Your Excellency"" or Mr/Madam Secretary, etc. A prime minister may be addressed as ""the Honorable"". A member of Parliament or other legislative body may have particular honorifics. A member of a Senate, for example, may be addressed as ""Senator"". The etiquette varies and most countries have protocol specifying the honorifics to be used for its state, judicial, military and other officeholders. Former military officers are sometimes addressed by their last military rank, such as ""Captain"", ""Colonel"", ""General"", etc. Honorifics in other languages and cultures. Ancient Rome. Ancient Rome had Roman honorifics like that of Augustus, which turned into titles over time. China. During the ancient and imperial periods, Chinese honorifics varied greatly based on one's social status, but with the end of Imperial China, many of these distinctions fell out of colloquial use. Some honorifics remain in use today, especially in formal writings for the court and business setting. In fact, the ability to use honorifics in China is now seen as a display of social status. In other words, educated people tend to rigidly use honorifics as a display of their status. In addition, the use of honorifics vary greatly across Chinese-speaking regions in the world. In Taiwan, for example, honorifics are more widely used in daily interactions. In Mainland China, however, honorifics tend to recede to formal settings. India. Indian honorifics abound, covering formal and informal relationships for social, commercial, spiritual, and generational links. Honorifics may be prefix, suffix, or replacement types. There are many variations. Italy. Italian honorifics are usually limited to formal situations. Professional titles like ""Ingegnere"" (engineer) are often substituted for the ordinary ""Signore"" (mister), while ""Dottore"" (doctor) is used very freely for any graduate of a university. When ending with an ""e"", honorifics lose it when juxtaposed to a surname: dottor Rossi, cardinal Martini, ragionier Fantozzi. Japan. Japanese honorifics are similar to English titles like ""Mister"" and ""Miss"", but in Japanese, which has many honorifics, their use is mandatory in many formal and informal social situations. Japanese grammar as a whole tends to function on hierarchy — honorific stems are appended to verbs and many nouns primarily names, and in many cases one word may be exchanged for another word entirely with the same verb- or noun-meaning, but with different honorific connotations. Java. Indonesia's Javanese majority ethnicity has many honorifics. ""I Gusti"" means ""His or Her Royal Majesty"". ""Bendara Raden Mas"", ""Bendara Mas"", or the contraction '""ndoro"" mean ""Prince, flag-bearer 'His Highness'"". ""Bapak"" and its contraction ""Pak"" mean: Sir, Mister, or literally ""Father"". ""Ibu"" and its contraction ""Bu"" mean: Madam, Ma'am, Ms, or Mrs, literally ""Mother"". ""Raden Emas"" and its contraction ""Mas"" mean: Mr. among colleagues, friends, and others of slightly higher age or social status, literally ""Golden Son"", ""Lord"", or ""Heir Apparent"". ""Raden Emas Behi"", contracted to ""Mas Behi"", means ""2nd Heir Apparent"" and is now obsolete. ""Raden Behi"", contracted to ""Den Behi"", means ""Heir Apparent"" and is now obsolete. ""mbak yu"" and the more common ""mbak"" are derived from Surakarta court to address adolescent or marriage age unmarried women, but is now for women, with no age or marital status connotation. ""Eyang Puteri"" and its contraction ""Eyang"" mean: grandmother, literally ""Grand Lady"". ""Eyang Putera Kakung"" and its contraction ""Eyang Kakung"" mean: grandfather, literally ""Grand Sir"". ""Bapak Gede"" and its contraction ""Pak de"" are used for a big father, uncle, or relative older than one's father, literally ""Grand Sir"". ""Bapak Cilik"" and its contraction ""Pak lik"" are used for a very familiar friend or sir, literally a small father or a relative younger than one's Gaflakapus father — but very familiar. ""Mbok"" is not an honorific and denotes an older woman of very low status. ""Bang"" or ""Bung"" is a somewhat outdated, egalitarian term to refer to a brotherhood among males. ""Bang"" is Betawi language for ""Mas"". Kiswahili. In areas of East Africa, where the Bantu language Kiswahili is spoken, ""mzee"" is frequently used for an elder to denote respect by younger speakers. It is used in direct conversation and used in referring to someone in the third person. Korean. Korean honorifics are similar to Japanese honorifics; their use is mandatory in many formal and informal social situations. Korean grammar as a whole tends to function on hierarchy — honorific stems are appended to verbs and some nouns, and in many cases, one word may be exchanged for another word entirely with the same verb- or noun-meaning, but with different honorific connotations. Linguists say that there are six levels of honorifics in Korean but, in daily conversation, only three of them are widely used in contemporary Korean. Suffix -si-(시) is used at most honorific verbs, but not always. Malay. Malay honorifics are the Malay language's complex system of titles and honorifics which is still extensively used in Malaysia and Brunei. Singapore, whose Malay royalty was abolished by the British colonial government in 1891, has adopted civic titles for its leaders. Pakistan. Pakistan has a large number of honorific forms that may be used with or as a substitute for names. The most common honorifics in Pakistan are usually placed immediately before the name of the subject or immediately after the subject. There are many variations across Pakistan. Philippines. The usage of Filipino honorifics differ from person to person. Like the occasional insertion of the word ""po"" in conversation. Though some have become obsolete, many are still widely used in order to denote respect, friendliness, or affection. Some new ""honorifics"" mainly used by teenagers are experiencing surges in popularity. Tagalog honorifics like: Binibini/Ate (""Miss""), Ginang/Aling/Manang (""Madam""), Ginoo/Mang/Manong/Kuya (""Mr."", ""Sir"") Depending on one's relation with the party being addressed, various honorifics may be used. As such addressing a man who is older, has a higher rank at work or has a higher social standing, one may use Mr or Sir followed by the First/ last/ or full name. Addressing a woman in a similar situation as above one may use Ms, Maam, or Madam followed by First/ last/ or full name. Older married women may prefer to be addressed as MRS. On a professional level many use educational or occupational titles such as Architect, Engineer, Doctor, Attorney. Spanish. Spanish has a number of honorific forms that may be used with or as substitutes for names, such as ""señor"" or ""caballero"" (""Mr."", ""Sir"", ""Gentleman""); ""señora"" (""Madam"", ""Mrs."", ""Lady"", ""ma'am"") and ""señorita"" (""Miss"", ""young lady""); ""licenciado"" for a person with bachelor's or a professional degree (e.g., attorneys and engineers); ""maestro"" for a teacher, master mechanic, or person with a master's degree; ""doctor"" (""doctor""); etc. Also used is ""don"" (male) or ""doña"" (female) for people of rank or, in some Latin American countries (e.g., Puerto Rico), for any senior citizen. In some Latin American countries, like Colombia, ""Doctor"" is used for any respected figure regardless of whether they have a doctoral degree (for instance Colombian presidents are often referred to as Doctor ___); likewise ""Maestro"" is used for artistic masters, especially painters. Additionally, older people and those with whom one would speak respectfully (e.g., one's boss or teacher), are often addressed as ""usted,"" a formal/respectiful way of saying ""you"" (e.g. ""Dra. Polo, ¿cómo está usted?"" Dr. Polo, how are you?). The word ""usted"" historically comes from the honorific title ""vuestra merced"" (literally ""your mercy""). Intimate friends and relatives are addressed as ""tú"". Addressing a relative stranger as ""tú"" is considered disrespectful or provocative, except when it's directed to a person notably younger than the speaker. Turkey. Turkish honorifics generally follow the first name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g. Name Bey Name Hanım [Ms., Name Hoca or cleric, Name Öğretmen for teacher). Such honorifics are used both in formal and informal situations. A newer honorific is ""Sayın"" , which precedes the surname or full name, and is not gender-specific. (e.g. Sayın Name Surname, or Sayın Surname). They are generally used in very formal situations. Opposition. People who have a strong sense of egalitarianism, such as Quakers and certain socialists, eschew honorific titles. When addressing or referring to someone, they will use the person's name, an informal pronoun, or some other style implying social equality, such as ""brother"", ""friend"", or ""comrade"". This was also the practice in Revolutionary France which used ""Citoyen"" (""Citizen"") as the manner of address. Feminist criticism of the use of separate honorifics for married and unmarried women (Mrs. and Miss) in the English language led to the widespread adoption of Ms. for all women. "
wikipedia-16803156," Xhavit Bajrami  Xhavit Bajrami (born October 30, 1975) is an Albanian-Swiss kickboxer who competes in the heavyweight division. A Seido karate practitioner and Andy Hug student, Bajrami built up an undefeated record domestically before he was recruited by K-1 where he won the ""K-1 Braves '99"" tournament and finished as runner-up in two other tournaments. He is also a two-time Muay Thai world champion, having won the ISKA World Super Heavyweight title in 2004 and the WKN World Super Heavyweight strap in 2010. Early life. A Kosovar Albanian, Bajrami was born in Pristina, SFR Yugoslavia (now Kosovo) in 1975. He relocated to Switzerland where he began practicing Seido karate and eventually kickboxing. Career. K-1 career (1998-2004). Bajrami transitioned from full contact karate to kickboxing under the tutelage of fellow karateka-turned-kickboxers Andy Hug and Michael Thompson, and amassed an undefeated record fighting domestically before being recruited by the world's premier kickboxing promotion, K-1 in 1998. In his promotional debut, Bajrami entered into a one night, eight-man tournament held on May 6, 1998 at ""K-1 Fight Night '98"" in Zurich. He needed an extension round to get past Matteo Minonzie in the quarter-finals, and was then eliminated from the tournament in the semis when his bout with Rob van Esdonk was stopped by the doctor in the first round. The stoppage was controversial as Bajrami claimed to have been hit by an illegal elbow from van Esdonk and refused to return to his feet, prompting the doctor to deem him unable to fight. He was back in action just over a month later when he fought to a five-round draw with Kirkwood Walker at ""K-1 Dream '98"" in Nagoya, Japan on July 17, 1998. Beginning his 1999 campaign on May 5 at ""K-1 Fight Night '99"" in Zurich, Bajrami went up against Carl Bernardo, brother of the great Mike Bernardo, and stopped the South African with a kick in round one. Just fifteen days later in Fukuoka, Japan, Bajrami was among the eight fighters battling it out to win the tournament at ""K-1 Braves '99"". He defeated Siniša Andrijašević by technical knockout in the quarter-finals when his opponent was not allowed continue on the advice of the doctor, and then faced Mirko Cro Cop at the semi-final stage. The bout was ruled a draw at the end of the regulation three rounds and so an extension round was added to decide the winner, after which Bajrami was given the nod by all three judges. Advancing to the finals, he faced another close fight against Lloyd van Dams but took a unanimous decision after an extra round once again to win the tournament and qualify for the 1999 K-1 World Grand Prix, the gathering of the world's sixteen best heavyweights. At the ""K-1 World Grand Prix '99 Opening Round"" in Osaka, Japan on October 5, 1999, Bajrami had his first of three meetings with Dutch legend Ernesto Hoost, losing by unanimous decision. After going 1-1 in the first half of the year with a decision loss to Stefan Leko at ""K-1 The Millennium"" in Osaka on April 23, 2000 and a points win over Samir Benazzouz at ""K-1 Fight Night 2000"" in Zurich on June 3, 2000, Bajrami was invited to compete in the ""K-1 Grand Prix Europe 2000"" in Zagreb, Croatia on September 1, 2000. He was able to go past Belgian duo Peter Bamoshi and Marc de Wit, respectively, before being stopped with a devastating high kick by Jörgen Kruth in the final. Following the sudden passing of his trainer Andy Hug in August 2000, Bajrami relocated to the Netherlands to train under Peter Aerts and Rene Rooze at Chakuriki Gym. During his time training at Chakuriki, his karate-based style shifted to take on numerous Muay Thai techniques. On March 3, 2001, he lost another decision to Ernesto Hoost at ""2 Hot 2 Handle: Simply the Best"" in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Then, in another rematch, he bested Samir Benazzouz by decision for the second time at the ""K-1 World Grand Prix 2001 in Nagoya"" on July 20, 2001. 2002 was a quiet year for Bajrami as he competed just once under the K-1 banner, albeit taking three fights in one night at the ""K-1 World Grand Prix 2002 Preliminary Croatia"" on April 13 in Zagreb. After TKOing Dragan Jovanović at the quarter-final stage, he took a unanimous points victory over Siniša Pulyak in the semis. Going up against fellow Swiss-based karateka Petar Majstorović in the tournament final, Bajrami lost by decision after an extra round was needed to separate the pair. Bajrami returned to tournament action on May 30, 2003 at the ""K-1 World Grand Prix 2003 in Basel"". He avenged his loss to Jörgen Kruth by taking an extension round split decision over the Swede at the first round but was then eliminated by the eventual tournament winner Jerrel Venetiaan in the semis. He bounced back with a decision win over familiar foe Siniša Pulyak in Croatia on September 12, 2003. On March 6, 2004, Bajrami was crowned the ISKA World Super Heavyweight (+96.4 kg/212.5 lb) Muay Thai Champion when he beat Australia's Peter Graham by decision in his birth city of Pristina, Kosovo. Returning to Japan for the first time in almost three years, Bajrami lost to Ernesto Hoost on points for the third time at the ""K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 in Saitama"" just twenty-one days later. Then, in what would be his last ever match in K-1, Bajrami took a unanimous decision victory over Martin Holm at the ""K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 in Nagoya"" on June 6, 2004. Post K-1 (2005-present). Despite racking up thirteen victories in K-1, Bajrami's run in the promotion came to an end in 2004. On September 18, 2004, he lost to Vitali Akhramenko via decision after five rounds of fighting in Basel, Switzerland. He then went 1-1 in 2005 with a split decision win over James Phillips and a loss at the hands of Karl Glyschinsky. Bajrami dropped a decision to Polish-Australian Muay Thai stylist Paul Slowinski in Switzerland on May 26, 2006, but followed it up with a third-round KO win over Tumelo Maphutha in South Africa five months later to set up a rematch with Slowinski on November 11, 2006 in Macau with the vacant WMC World Super Heavyweight (+95 kg/209.4 lb) Championship on the line this time. After a gruelling five round battle in which Bajrami sustained multiple gashes to the head, Slowinski was awarded the decision and walked away with the belt. 2007 was another mixed year for him. He knocked out Alessandro D'Ambrossio in the first round at the ""Night of Fighters 4"" event in Bern, Switzerland but then dropped a decision to giant Russian Alexander Ustinov in Moscow a month later. Bajrami fought Petar Majstorović for the second time on February 9, 2008 in Switzerland and got his own back on the Croatian, winning the decision after three rounds. He then TKO'd Dániel Török in November of that year in Sursee, Switzerland before finishing American Mike Shepherd with a highlight reel high kick on June 27, 2009 in the same city. He ended the year with a controversial defence of his ISKA world title on November 21, 2009 in Pristina, Kosovo against fellow K-1 veteran Freddy Kemayo. Kemayo was deducted a point in the fourth round for a head butt, and the judges scored the bout a split draw (50-48, 46-47, 48-48) after the final bell. On December 18, 2010, Bajrami became a world champion for the second time with a third round low kick stoppage of Dawid Trólka in Zurich to take the WKN World Super Heavyweight (+96.6 kg/213 lb) Muay Thai belt. In what is generally considered to be a biased hometown decision, Bajrami defended his ISKA strap against Indian challenger Singh Jaideep in Lucerne on July 2, 2011. He was floored by Jaideep in round one but received a long count and was able to recover. He was then expected to make a return to K-1 and fight Daniel Ghiţă at the ""K-1 World Grand Prix 2011 in Nanjing Final 16"" on October 29, 2011. However, the event was cancelled due to the promotion experiencing severe financial problems. Bajrami made the third defence of his ISKA world title by knocking out Takenori Onda with a high kick in the fourth round of their contest in Lucerne on June 2, 2012. "

Having finished his basic education, he graduated in Accountancy from the Punjab University. During the Second World War, his parents moved to New Delhi, capital of the British Indian Empire. It was here that he discovered his love for journalism. The newspaper world attracted him far more than the dull books of accountancy. He had a passion for reading and writing and a fondness for newspapers and magazines. He sat glued to his radio set, listening to the latest war news. In 1940, when he was still a student, he started a newspaper for Muslims in pre-partition Hindustan fighting in World War II in Delhi. He called it the Jang, or War. This was not an exaggerated name as some believed, but a statement against war, and so Mir Khalil-ur-Rehman made it clear that he was doing this for the soldiers and not to encourage the Second World War. Career. When the creation of the Muslim-majority State of Pakistan was established on August 14, 1947, Mir Saheb moved to Karachi, capital of the new Muslim State, and started publishing the Daily Jang from there which was funded by a loan of 5000 rupees from Abdul Ghani Barq of Ferozsons Printers. Pakistan's Governor General, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was delighted due to this move and offered the government's help in running it. Mir Saheb however, declined the offer saying that freedom of the press was his motto and the goal for the Fourth pillar of State in Pakistan. Mir Saheb galvanised the press in Pakistan and helped in founding the Council of Pakistan Newspapers Editors (CPNE). He opposed tooth and nail any Government measure or action which curbed the freedom of the press in Pakistan. His legacy. Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman's legacy in Pakistan is the well established Jang Group of newspapers which are published from all the major cities of Pakistan. His newspaper empire is managed by his two sons, Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman and Mir Javed-ur-Rahman. Mir saheb personally trained them in the science of newspaper management. As a result, besides expanding the Jang newspaper group, they have added to it a powerful GEO television channel which has shaped into Pakistan's most popular television channel and its programmes can also be watched in the US and the UK and many parts of the Islamic world.  Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman continued to work at the newspaper till his death in 1992. ""MKRF"" is a foundation based on his great activities. "
wikipedia-723301," Morgan Spurlock  Morgan Valentine Spurlock (born November 7, 1970) is an American documentary filmmaker, humorist, television producer, screenwriter, and political activist, best known for the documentary films ""Super Size Me"", ""Where In The World Is Osama Bin Laden"", ', ' and """". Spurlock was the executive producer and star of the reality television series ""30 Days"". As of June 2013, Spurlock hosts and produces the CNN show ""Inside Man"" and is the co-founder of short-film content marketing company cinelan, which produced the Focus Forward campaign for GE. Early life. Spurlock was born in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and was raised in Beckley, West Virginia. He was raised a Methodist. He went to New York University and graduated in 1993 and is a member of the fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta. Spurlock has stated that he is of Scottish, English, and Irish descent. He performed stand-up in both New York and Los Angeles. Career. Spurlock attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Beckley, West Virginia, graduating in 1989. He graduated with a BFA in film from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1993. Before making the 2004 Academy Award nominated ""Super Size Me"", Spurlock was a playwright, winning awards for his play ""The Phoenix"" at both the New York International Fringe Festival in 1999 and the Route 66 American Playwriting Competition in 2000. He also created ""I Bet You Will"" for MTV. ""I Bet You Will"" began as a popular Internet webcast of five-minute episodes featuring ordinary people doing stunts in exchange for money. Examples include eating a full jar of mayonnaise ($235USD), eating a ""worm burrito"" ($265USD), and taking shots of corn oil, Pepto-Bismol, lemon juice, hot sauce, cold chicken broth, and cod liver oil (US$450.00 for all nine shots). The webcast was a success, with over a million hits in the first five days. MTV later bought and aired the show. Film. ""Super Size Me"". Spurlock's docudrama ""Super Size Me"" was released in the U.S. on May 7, 2004. This production was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary feature. He conceived the idea for the film when he was at his parents' house for Thanksgiving, and while watching TV saw a news story about a lawsuit brought against McDonald's by two teenage girls who blamed the fast food chain for their obesity. The film depicts an experiment he conducted in 2003, in which he ate three McDonald's meals a day every day (and nothing else) for 30 days. The film's title derives from one of the rules of Spurlock's experiment: he would not refuse the ""super-size"" option whenever it was offered to him and would never ask for it himself. The end result, according to Spurlock, was a diet with twice the calories recommended by the USDA. Further, Spurlock attempted to curtail his physical activity to better match the exercise habits of the average American (he previously walked about 3 miles a day, whereas the average American walks 1.5 miles). He was of above average health and fitness when he started the project; he gained 25 pounds (11 kg), became quite puffy, suffered liver dysfunction and depression by the end. Spurlock's supervising physicians noted the effects caused by his high-carbohydrate diet—once even comparing it to a case of severe binge alcoholism. After the completion of the project, it took Spurlock fourteen months to return to his normal weight of 185 pounds (84 kg). His then-girlfriend (now ex-wife), Alexandra Jamieson, took charge of his recovery with her ""detox diet"", which became the basis for her book, ""The Great American Detox Diet"". Other. Spurlock's second feature documentary, ""Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?"" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2008. In the film, and in interviews, Spurlock explores the fight against terrorism and views the argument from both sides, in which he tries to find Osama Bin Laden. Spurlock directed ""The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!"". ""Freakonomics"" is an adaptation of the book of the same name by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, which premiered in April 2010. Spurlock was at the helm of this project alongside five directors (Heidi Ewing, Rachel Grady, Alex Gibney, Seth Gordon and Eugene Jarecki). The one hour documentary ""Committed: The Toronto International Film Festival"" premiered on AMC on 12 October 2010. """" is a 2011 documentary film about product placement, marketing and advertising which was reportedly itself financed through product placement, ""The Greatest Movie Ever Sold"" was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2011. It was released in the USA in April 2011. It screened in the New Zealand Film Festival in August 2011 together with an appearance by Spurlock to talk about the movie. In the summer of 2010, Spurlock worked with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" creator Joss Whedon, AintItCool.com founder Harry Knowles, and comic book creator Stan Lee to create the documentary """", to cover the stories of convention fans. Whedon, Lee, and Knowles served as executive producers. Legendary Pictures' Thomas Tull, who independently financed the documentary, told ""Variety"", """"We look forward to capturing the spirit, energy and people that Comic-Con has infused into legions of fans, bringing these audiences and projects out of the halls and onto a world stage."" On April 6, 2012, Spurlock released the film to selected theaters in the United States, as well as video on demand outlets. Spurlock hosts and produces a new CNN series ""Inside Man"", which first aired in June 2013. ""30 Days"". In each episode, a person (who, in some cases, is Spurlock himself) or a group of people spend 30 days immersing themselves in a mode of life markedly different from their norm (being in prison, a devout Christian living in a Muslim family, a homophobe staying with a homosexual person, etc.), while Spurlock discusses the relevant social issues involved. FX began airing the show on June 15, 2005. In the premiere episode of the first season, ""Minimum Wage,"" Spurlock and his fiancée lived for 30 days in the Bottoms neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio, earning minimum wage, with no access to outside funds. In the second season finale, Spurlock spent 25 days locked in a Henrico County, Virginia (a county outside of Richmond) jail to experience life as an inmate. He did not complete the entire 30 days in jail because the majority of inmates in the state of Virginia serve 85% of the sentence, so once Spurlock reached that benchmark, he was released from the prison. The third season of ""30 Days"" premiered on June 3, 2008. The first episode of the third season, titled ""Working in a Coal Mine,"" was filmed in Bolt, West Virginia which is located roughly 18 miles from the city of Beckley, West Virginia, where Spurlock was raised prior to leaving for New York. In late 2008, FX announced they would not be renewing the ""30 Days"" series, making the third season the last. Personal life. Spurlock has a son, Laken James Spurlock, born on December 9, 2006. His birth is depicted in Spurlock's documentary ""Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?"", which Spurlock dedicated to Laken. "
wikipedia-37137," Arabidopsis  Arabidopsis (""A-ra-bi-dóp-sis"", rockcress) is a genus in the family Brassicaceae. They are small flowering plants related to cabbage and mustard. This genus is of great interest since it contains thale cress (""Arabidopsis thaliana""), one of the model organisms used for studying plant biology and the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced. Changes in thale cress are easily observed, making it a very useful model. Status. Currently, the genus ""Arabidopsis"" has 9 species and a further eight subspecies recognised. This delimitation is quite recent, and is based on morphological and molecular phylogenies by O'Kane and Al-Shehbaz (1997, 2003) and others. Their findings confirm the species formerly included in ""Arabidopsis"" made it polyphyletic. The most recent reclassification moves two species previously placed in ""Cardaminopsis"" and ""Hylandra"" and three species of ""Arabis"" into ""Arabidopsis"", but excludes 50 that have been moved into the new genera ""Beringia, Crucihimalaya, Ianhedgea, Olimarabidopsis"", and ""Pseudoarabidopsis"". All of the species in ""Arabidopsis"" are indigenous to Europe, while two of the species have broad ranges also extending into North America and Asia. In the last two decades, ""Arabidopsis thaliana"" has gained much interest from the scientific community as a model organism for research on numerous aspects of plant biology. The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) is a curated online information source for ""Arabidopsis thaliana"" genetic and molecular biology research, and The Arabidopsis Book is an online compilation of invited chapters on ""Arabidopsis thaliana"" biology. In Europe, the model organism resource centre for ""Arabidopsis thaliana"" germplasm, bioinformatics and molecular biology resources (including GeneChips) is the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre – NASC whilst in North America germplasm services are provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, (ABRC) based at the Ohio State University. The ordering system for ABRC was incorporated into The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database in June 2001 whilst NASC has always (since 1991) hosted its own ordering system and genome browser. ""A. thaliana"" in partial ""in vitro"" conditions. Recently, ""A. thaliana"" tissues have been cultivated in microfluidic devices. Plant-on-chip devices show promise for future research in understanding the mechanism of sexual reproduction in ""A. thaliana"". Cytogenetics. Cytogenetic analysis has shown the haploid chromosome number (n) is variable and can be 5, 8 and 13. ""A. thaliana"" is n=5 and the DNA sequencing of this species was completed in 2001. ""A. suecica"" is n=13 (5+8) and is an amphidiploid species originated through hybridization between ""A. thaliana"" and diploid ""A. arenosa"".  ""A. neglecta"" is n=8, as are the various subspecies of ""A. halleri"". Various subspecies of ""A. lyrata"" and ""A. arenosa"" can be either 2n (diploid) or 4n (tetraploid).  As of 2005, ""A. cebennensis"", ""A. croatica"" and ""A. pedemontana"" have not been investigated cytologically. Reclassified species. The following species previously placed in ""Arabidopsis"" are not currently considered part of the genus. "

wikipedia-457096," National emblem of Belarus  The national emblem of Belarus (, ), which replaced the historic Pahonia arms in a 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colors of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is sometimes referred to as the coat of arms of Belarus, although this is incorrect due to the lack of several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria. Description. Design. In the center of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus, superimposed over the rays of a golden sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) in purple and waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. Wrapped around the wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colors of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets at the base of the emblem, where the name ""Republic of Belarus"" (""Рэспублiка Беларусь"") is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language. At the top of the emblem there is a five-pointed red star. Symbolism. The elements that comprise the state emblem are not tied to any ""official"" symbolism. The design of the emblem of the Byelorussian SSR was used as the basis for the current Belarusian emblem; the primary difference between the two is that the Byelorussian SSR emblem contains more references to Communism, such as the Communist symbol of hammer and sickle and pure red ribbon, which the modern emblem does not, replaced with the outline and the flag of Belarus, respectively, however it still retains the communist red star, the globe and the wheat bundles, which are also typical of Soviet emblems and still is very Soviet in nature. Legislation. The current law regulating the design and use of the Belarusian emblem was passed on July 5, 2004. Article 9 of Chapter 3 of Law No. 301-3 begins by describing the official drawing of the Belarusian arms and regulates on its proper design. Officially, the arms can be drawn in full color, monochrome or using two colors. Article 10 states that the national emblem must be displayed at specified locations on a continual basis, such as the residences of the Belarusian leader, the chamber of the National Assembly and at governmental offices of national and regional levels. The emblem can also be used on documents issued by the government, including money, passports and official letterheads. The law also restricts the use of the emblem in other contexts—e.g. cities, towns or oblasts may not adopt a coat of arms or emblem using the national emblem either completely or in part. Furthermore, organizations not listed in the Law on State Symbols may only use the emblem by permission. The emblem can be used by both foreigners and citizens of Belarus, as long as the symbol is displayed with respect, although citizens may not use the state emblem on letterheads or business cards if they are not agents of the government. In addition to standard usages listed in the law, the emblem has been used in various other circumstances. The emblem is displayed, along with the national flag, at the beginning and the end of a video clip with the Belarusian anthem ""My Belarusy"", regularly played on Belarusian TV. Another use of the emblem is on ballot boxes and campaign mailings used during national and local elections. The emblem also appears on Belarus's border posts. History. Pahonia. The Pahonia was used as an official coat of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1366 after being first used as the personal arms of Algirdas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania. The arms continued to be used until Grand Duchy of Lithuania were annexed by the Russian Empire in 1795, though the arms was incorporated into the Imperial coat of arms. The idea of return to the historic national symbol was pursued by Belarusian poet Maksim Bahdanovič in his poem ""Pahonia"". The arms was again used in 1918 when the short-lived Belarusian People's Republic used the Pahonia as part of their emblem. More recently, the Pahonia was the official coat of arms starting in 1991, when Belarus declared itself independent of the Soviet Union. It was replaced by the current emblem following a controversial referendum held in 1995. Since it was dropped as the official emblem of Belarus, opposition groups such as the Belarusian People's Front have used the Pahonia as part of their own party symbols or used them as a form of protest against Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Emblem of the Byelorussian SSR. From 1920 until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Byelorussian SSR used an emblem instead of a coat of arms. The first emblem used by Soviet Byelorussia was adopted in 1919 and is similar to the contemporary insignia of the Russian and Ukrainian republics. The central part of the emblem is a stylized red shield, showing a golden sun rising from the base. Above the sun is a crossed golden hammer and sickle, symbolizing unity between workers and peasants. Above the hammer and sickle, the letters ""Б.С.С.Р"" are shown in black, denoting the name of the republic. БССР (BSSR) is an abbreviation for the full name of the republic; ""Беларуская Савецкая Сацыялістычная Рэспубліка"", the ""Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic"". The shield is framed by ears of wheat meeting at the its base and featuring a red ribbon inscribed in black with the state motto of the Soviet Union, ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" The text is written in the Belarusian language. In 1937, this emblem was replaced by a new one, removing the shield and including more text. The right side of the emblem features oak leaves and the left features wheat ears with clovers placed on top. In the center of the emblem, a sun is rising behind a profile of Earth. A hammer, sickle and red star appears over the sun. Around the ears of wheat and leaves of oak is a red ribbon, featuring the phrase ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" written (from left to right) in Belarusian, Yiddish, Polish and Russian. The initials ""Б.С.С.Р"" are shown at its base denoting the name of the republic. Ten years before in 1927, the arms was the same except for the wording on the bottom ribbon. Instead of the letters reading БССР, the letters read ""С.С.Р.Б"", which stood for the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belarus. This emblem was in turn replaced by a new one in 1950. The central feature of this symbol is a crossed hammer and sickle, a universal Communist symbol symbolizing the unity of workers and peasants. Below this symbol, a sun is shown rising behind a globe. The insignia is framed by ears of wheat, each ear ending in flowers; clover on the left and flax on the right. A red ribbon is wrapped around the ears of wheat, reminiscent of the red flag used by the Communist movement. The base of the emblem shows the letters ""БССР"". The ribbon features the phrase ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" The left side inscribed in Belarusian, the right side in Russian. The red star of Communism is featured above the hammer and sickle. The 1950 version was designed by Ivan Dubasov, a People's Artist of the USSR. Article 119 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR defines the design of the emblem. 1995 referendum. On May 14, 1995, a referendum was conducted in all regions of Belarus. Out of four questions, one was the following: ""Do you support the introduction of the new national symbols?"" With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new state symbols were approved by a ratio of 3:1 (75.1% to 24.9%). The way the referendum was carried out was heavily criticized by the opposition, including the exact wording of the question about the national insignia. Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared to ones, used by collaboration forces, in propaganda that was published during the run-up to the vote. The comparison was made due to the white, red, white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada, the Belarusian government under the control of Nazi Germany. Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet-inspired symbols as a victory, especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base, by saying ""we have returned to you the flag of the country for which you fought. We have returned to you both memory and a sense of human pride."" "
wikipedia-13089086," Standard Catalog of World Coins  The Standard Catalog of World Coins is a series of numismatic catalogs, commonly known as the Krause catalogs. They are published by Krause Publications, a division of F+W Publications. Overview. The by-century volumes list by date virtually every coin type, most of which are photographed, with mintage and other information, plus market valuations in up to 5 grades. Listings are by denomination rather than series, as in earlier World coin catalogs. The proprietary Krause-Mishler (or KM) numbers are widely used; for just a few countries earlier systems such as Y (Yeoman) and C (Craig) numbers are given instead. The century format is often considered inconvenient and expensive for those who collect geographically, and date listings are clipped at the century mark. Originally covering 1800-date, the main catalog (first edition 1972) evolved into an annual 20th century-only work, plus separate 17th, 18th, and 19th century volumes which are revised less frequently. Beginning with the 34th (2007) ed, listings after 2000 are dropped, and an annual 21st Century catalog covers 2001-date.  Data from the by-century volumes are collated together in special editions for Crowns, Gold, German, and North American coins. Fantasies and medallion issues, which do not appear in the other catalogs, are covered a product called ""Unusual World Coins"". There is also a publication called ""Collecting World Coins"" that includes only 20th- and 21st-century coins that circulated regularly. The 12th (1986) and 19th (1992) are two-volume hardcovers covering 1700-date; 13th (1987) is the last edition to include cross-references to Yeoman and Craig; 23rd (1996) is the last main edition covering 1800-date; 33rd (2006) is the last 20th century edition including 21st century listings. List priced at $73 to $85 ($25 for the shorter 21st century catalog) they are often discounted, and can be found in many public libraries. Older editions are steeply discounted even though revisions between editions in many areas are minimal. Following the appearance of pirated DVD versions, DVDs were included with the 1601-1700 4th edition, the 1901-2000 36th edition, and possibly others, but are now sold as a separate product. Early editions attribute authorship to the publisher Chester L. Krause, and Clifford Mishler, although starting with the second edition Colin R. Bruce II was the actual chief compiler and is given an editor or senior editor title on later editions. George S.

wikipedia-33130384," Gabby Douglas  Gabrielle Christina Victoria ""Gabby"" Douglas (born December 31, 1995) is an American artistic gymnast. As a member of the U.S. Women's Gymnastics team at the 2012 Summer Olympics, she won gold medals in both the individual and team all-around competitions. Douglas is the first woman of color and the first African-American gymnast in Olympic history to become the individual all-around champion, and the first American gymnast to win gold in both the individual all-around and team competitions at the same Olympics as well as being the only American All-Around Champion to win multiple gold medals, thus far. She was also a member of the gold-winning U.S. team at the 2011 World Championships. Early life. Douglas was born on December 31, 1995 in Virginia Beach, Virginia, to parents Timothy Douglas and Natalie Hawkins. She has three siblings. She began training in gymnastics at age six when her older sister, Arielle, convinced their mother to enroll her in gymnastics classes. In October 2002, Douglas began her gymnastics training at Gymstrada Gymnastics in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In July 2004, Gabrielle left Gymstrada and began training at Excalibur Gymnastics.  At the age of eight, Douglas won the Level 4 all-around gymnastics title at the 2004 Virginia State Championships. Junior career. 2008. Douglas made her national debut in 2008 at the US Classic in Houston, Texas, where she placed 10th in the all-around rankings. She went on to compete at the 2008 Visa Championships in Boston, Massachusetts. Placing at #16 in that competition, Douglas was not eligible for the 2008 Junior Women's National Team.  2009. In 2009, Gabrielle suffered a fracture in the growth plate of her wrist. Due to this injury, she was largely unable to compete and missed the 2009 CoverGirl US Classic. While she competed at the 2009 Visa Championships in Dallas, Texas, Douglas was unable to perform her full routines and competed only on Balance Beam and Floor Exercise.  2010. Douglas competed at the 2010 Nastia Liukin Supergirl Cup, a televised Level 10 meet held in Worcester, Massachusetts, where Douglas placed fourth all-around. Her first elite meet was the 2010 CoverGirl Classic in Chicago, Illinois, where Douglas placed third on balance beam, 6th on vault and 9th all-around in the junior division. At the 2010 U.S. Junior National Championships, Douglas won the silver medal on balance beam, placed fourth all-around and on vault, and tied for eighth on floor exercise. At the 2010 Pan American Championships in Guadalajara, Mexico, Douglas won the uneven bars title, and she won a share of the U.S. team gold medal. She also placed fifth all-around. In October, at age 14, Douglas moved from Virginia Beach to West Des Moines, Iowa to train under Liang Chow, the former coach of 2007 World Champion and 2008 Summer Olympics gold medalist Shawn Johnson. Although Douglas' former coach, Walker, stated in 2012 that she was convinced Douglas could have made it to the Olympics if she had remained in Virginia Beach, Douglas said, ""Something clicked in my head that said, if I really want to make this happen I need to get better coaching."" The impetus for Douglas's move to Iowa was when Walker had invited Chow to teach a clinic at her gym, Excalibur. Douglas was impressed when Chow was able to teach her how to perform the Amanar vault in a single afternoon. Douglas considered a move to Texas to train with a renowned coach there, but after that coach declined to train her out of loyalty to Walker, Douglas selected Chow. Chow was initially skeptical, since Douglas had been just one of hundreds of kids at the clinic in Virginia Beach. However, Chow subsequently informed Douglas's Excalibur coaches that he had agreed to train her, but pointed out that he did not recruit her, saying, ""I would never recruit anybody to my program."" Senior career. 2011. At the City of Jesolo Trophy in Italy, Douglas won a share of the U.S. team gold medal. She also placed second on floor, tied for third on beam, and placed fourth in the all-around and on vault. Douglas earned the silver medal in uneven bars at the CoverGirl Classic in Chicago. At the 2011 U.S. National Championships in St. Paul, Minnesota, Douglas tied for third on bars and placed seventh all-around. At the 2011 World Championships in Tokyo, Japan, Douglas shared in the team gold medal won by the U.S. Douglas also placed fifth in uneven bars. 2012. At the AT&T American Cup at Madison Square Garden in March, Douglas received the highest total all-around score in the women's competition, ahead of her teammate and current world champion Jordyn Wieber. However, her scores did not count towards winning the competition because she was an alternate. Later in March, she was part of the gold-winning U.S. team at the Pacific Rim Championships, where she also won gold in uneven bars. At the 2012 U.S. National Championships in June, Douglas won the gold medal in uneven bars, silver in the all-around, and bronze in floor. Márta Károlyi, the National Team Coordinator for USA Gymnastics, nicknamed Douglas the ""Flying Squirrel"" for her aerial performance on the uneven bars. At the 2012 Olympic Trials held in San Jose, California on July 1st, Gabrielle placed first in the all-around rankings, securing the only guaranteed spot on the Women's Olympic Gymnastic Team. Also in July, Douglas and her teammates were featured on the cover of ""Sports Illustrated"" ""Olympic Preview"" issue. This marked the first time an entire Olympic gymnastics team had been featured on the cover of the magazine. She appeared on ""Rock Center with Brian Williams"" on July 19, where she discussed her family background and Olympic ambitions. On July 20, Douglas was featured on one of five ""Time"" magazine Olympic covers. Summer Olympics. Douglas and her teammates, McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman, Kyla Ross and Jordyn Wieber (nicknamed the ""Fierce Five""), won the team all-around gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She then won the gold medal in the individual all-around, becoming the first African-American woman, as well as the first woman of color of any nationality, to win the event. She is also the first American gymnast ever to win both the team and individual all-around gold at the same Olympics. Douglas finished eighth in uneven bars, and seventh in balance beam. She is the first all-around champion to not medal in an individual event since women's gymnastics was added to the Olympics in 1952. On August 3, the Kellogg Company announced that it would feature a picture of Douglas standing on the podium with her gold medal on special-edition boxes of Corn Flakes in the fall. This breaks the tradition of Olympic athletes appearing on Wheaties boxes. On August 13, Douglas appeared on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"", which also featured U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama. – includes video from ETonline.comThe Monday metered ratings for Douglas's appearance were the highest for the talk show in 2012 since the night after the Super Bowl. On August 26, Douglas spoke about racist bullying at Excalibur Gymnastics in an interview with Oprah Winfrey and how it nearly made her quit the sport. She described an incident in which she had heard other girls at the gym say ""Why doesn’t Gabby do it? She’s our slave” when chalk needed to be scraped off the bars. The CEO of Excalibur Gymnastics, Gustavo Maure, has denied these claims. Post-Olympics. In September 2012, Nintendo announced that Douglas would be part of a new ad campaign for ""New Super Mario Bros. 2"". On September 4, Douglas led the Pledge of Allegiance at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. The night before the Election, Douglas appeared at President Barack Obama's campaign rally in Norfolk, Virginia, where she introduced Stevie Wonder and Olympic track and field gold medalist Francena McCorory.

She and her Fierce Five teammates introduced Alicia Keys, who sang ""Girl on Fire"" Keys was joined by Nicki Minaj who rapped her verses from the Inferno Remix of the song. When Minaj rapped the line ""But I got 'em aggy, cause I win the gold like Gabby"", Douglas appeared on stage and performed a brief routine containing cartwheels, jumps and back hand springs. In December, Douglas released the inspirational autobiography, ""Grace, Gold, and Glory: My Leap of Faith"", which recounts of her rise to the top of the gymnastics world, the struggles she faced along the way, and her strong faith that always kept her going. The book debuted at number 4 on ""The New York Times"" Young Adult Bestseller List. In December, the Associated Press named her the Female Athlete of the Year. Douglas became the fourth gymnast to receive the honor. In June 2013, Douglas received two BET Awards for her accomplishments. In August, Douglas moved to Los Angeles to be with her family. Although she is no longer training with Chow, she said that she is still preparing to compete in the 2016 Olympics. "
wikipedia-1606504," Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui  The Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (abbreviated SKH), also known as the Hong Kong Anglican Church (Episcopal), is the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macao. It is the 38th Province of the Anglican Communion. It is also one of the major denominations in Hong Kong.  The Most Rev. Dr Paul Kwong is the current Archbishop and Primate of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui and Bishop of the Diocese of Hong Kong Island with his seat at St John's Cathedral. The Rt Rev. Andrew Chan is Bishop of the Diocese of Western Kowloon. Anglican Communion. The Anglican Church is a global family and a fellowship of churches which trace their roots to the Church of England, with a province being a basic autonomous unit. There are presently 38 independent and self-governing provinces spanning over 160 countries. With well over 100 million members, The Holy Anglican Communion is the third largest church in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches. In the Anglican Communion, there is no central governing authority. Churches uphold and proclaim the Catholic and Apostolic faith. The front-line unit of Church is the ""parish"". Parishes of similar vicinity are then grouped together to form a ""diocese"". Dioceses sharing similar cultural and national background would unite and form a ""province"", participating in the Anglican Communion under the leadership and jurisdiction of an archbishop. The Four Instruments of Unity for the Anglican Communion: Anglican Faith. The Anglican Faith is based on the belief that the Bible, the Holy Scriptures of the Old and the New Testaments, ""contain all things necessary to salvation"". Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui further maintains the ministry of the Church which it has received through the Episcopacy in the three orders of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. History and origin. Sheng Kung Hui started in Hong Kong in 1843. The first Chinese church, St. Stephen's Church, was founded in 1865. From then onwards, in the course of development of the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macao, churches continued to grow and witnessed the establishment of the Diocese of Victoria () in 1849 under the See of Canterbury; the establishment of the Kong Yuet Diocese () under the Province of the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui () in 1913; and the birth of the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao () in 1951, which was subsequently completely separated from the national Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui. In the 40th Synod of the Diocese held in December 1991, it was resolved that steps were to be taken to expand the Diocese into a province and eventually in 1998, the Province of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui was established. Structure. Dioceses and Missionary Area. Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui consists of three dioceses and one missionary area. There is a bishop in each diocese. The dioceses are: ""(The Diocese of Eastern Kowloon and the Diocese of Western Kowloon are divided by the geographical constituencies of the Legislative Council in the New Territories, and along the Kowloon-Canton Railway in Kowloon and New Kowloon.)"" The missionary area is: Parishes and churches. A complete list is also available in Chinese Wikipedia General synod. The Provincial General Synod is composed of the House of Bishop, the House of Clegy and the House of Laity. Members come from the Diocese of Hong Kong Island, the Diocese of Eastern Kowloon, the Diocese of Western Kowloon and the Missionary Area of Macao. Under the General Synod, there are different Commissions responsible for different areas of ministry. Mission and pastoral work. The Church is a community with no boundaries in age, social or ethnic status. Members include Chinese, other Asians and Westerners from all over the world. The worship in Churches features English, Filipino, Cantonese Chinese and Mandarin Chinese. Social service. Social service of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui started in mid 18th Century. At present, many social service organizations and social service models in Hong Kong were those initiated and promoted by the Church. Services provided by the Church are multi-faceted, including services for family and child-care, children and youth, the elderly, rehabilitation service, community development service and other supportive services. There are more than 230 units providing social service run by Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui at present. In January 2010, the Inland Revenue Department began to pursue the SKH for unpaid taxes in the amount of HK$180 million, relating to a parcel of land in Tai Po which originally housed an orphanage. In 1993, after the closure of the orphanage, the SKH let Cheung Kong Holdings develop luxury apartments on the site, and were estimated to have made profits of HK$450 million in cash, in addition to receiving 120 apartments for free. Education. There are altogether 33 secondary schools sponsored by Sheng Kung Hui in the territory, amongst which namely: Education reform controversy. Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, with its sponsored primary and secondary schools, were embroiled in the School-Based Management Policy controversy with the government in 2002, five years after the handover. SKH Ming Hua Theological College. Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui runs its own theological college: Ming Hua Theological College, named after Bishop Ronald Owen Hall. Ming Hua College was established in 1947 by Bishop R.O. Hall in what was then the Church of England’s Diocese of Victoria. It was at first dedicated to the education of Chinese lay Christians, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds. In 1996, now part of the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao, the College was renamed Sheng Kung Hui (“Holy Catholic Church”) Ming Hua Theological College and given the responsibility of training priests for full-time ministry in the Church. This work continues today as part of the Anglican Province of Hong Kong and Macao, with Ming Hua being the Provincial training centre for clergy and laity. The College’s broader identity, now as in 1947, is to encourage active participation in the thoughtful life of the Church. By providing high quality theological programmes, the College has always encouraged members of the Anglican Church to explore deeper understandings of their faith. Additionally, the strong fellowships founded in mutual respect, support, assistance, understanding and tolerance between all members, helps the study of theology at Ming Hua to move beyond the College and into the wider reaches of our communities. Much like the local societies of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macao, Ming Hua embraces local, national, and international perspectives. Visiting professors and overseas scholars are frequent guests at the College, exchanging and sharing with local members of the Church. The College is also closely involved with its ecumenical partners in the territory, and the Three Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China. "
wikipedia-30007," The Matrix  The Matrix is a 1999 American–Australian science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers, and starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Hugo Weaving. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"". ""The Matrix"" is known for popularizing a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre. It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and prominently pays homage to works such as Jean Baudrillard's ""Simulacra and Simulation"" and Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions. ""The Matrix"" was first released in the United States on , 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was generally well-received by critics, and won four Academy Awards as well as other accolades including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised ""The Matrix"" for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and its entertainment. The film's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing. The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise. Despite this, the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films,--> and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation. The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowskis, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"". The ""Matrix"" franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. Plot. Thomas Anderson is a computer programmer who maintains a double life as the hacker ""Neo"". Infamous hacker Trinity contacts Neo and informs him that a man named Morpheus can tell him the meaning of ""the Matrix"", a cryptic phrase he has uncovered; however, three dark-suited Agents, led by Agent Smith, arrest Neo to prevent this. Evading surveillance, Neo meets with Morpheus, who warns that he can be shown the Matrix but will be unable to ""go back"". Neo accepts by choosing an offered red pill; his reality soon disintegrates and he abruptly wakes, naked and weak, in a liquid-filled vessel, to find he is one of billions of people connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued by Morpheus and brought aboard a levitating ship, the ""Nebuchadnezzar"". Morpheus tells Neo that he is from Zion, the last free human refuge. He explains that in reality, there was a war in which humans lost to intelligent machines. Humans had destroyed the machines' access to solar energy and the machines had responded by connecting humans from birth to a simulation of the 1999 world, called ""the Matrix"", and harvesting their bioelectricity as a substitute power source. Neo has been living in this simulation since birth. Morpheus and his crew are one of several who ""unplug"" enslaved humans and recruit them as rebels. They can hack into the Matrix to re-enter its simulated reality, where their understanding of its true nature allows them to manipulate the simulation's physical laws, granting them seemingly superhuman abilities, but the simulation protects itself from threats using powerful human-like sentient programs known as ""Agents"". Neo learns that fatal injuries within the Matrix will manifest as death of the physical body. He proves highly skilled during virtual combat training, and Morpheus believes Neo is ""the One"", a man prophesied to end the war between humans and machines.  The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. The Oracle implies to Neo that he is not the One, and warns he will soon have to choose between his own life and that of Morpheus. Still within the Matrix, the group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, and Morpheus allows himself to be captured to let Neo and the rest of the crew escape. Their departure from the simulated world is hindered by Cypher, a crew member disillusioned with the harshness of the real world, who has secretly betrayed them to the Agents in exchange for a return to comfortable life within the Matrix. Cypher murders several of the group whose real bodies lie defenseless in the ship, before he is himself killed by the brother of one of them. In the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to Zion's main computer.  Neo returns to the Matrix with Trinity to rescue Morpheus; in the process, Neo gains confidence in his ability to manipulate the Matrix, performing physical feats on a par with the Agents. Morpheus tells Neo that the Oracle only told him what he needed to hear. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. Outside the Matrix, ""sentinel"" machines converge on the ""Nebuchadnezzar"". Trinity, standing over Neo in the real world, whispers to Neo that the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo, and he revives in the Matrix. His ability to perceive and control the Matrix reaches a new height, and he effortlessly destroys Smith before exiting the Matrix in time for the ship's electromagnetic pulse weapon to destroy the attacking sentinels. Some time later, Neo makes a telephone call in the Matrix, promising the Machines he will show their prisoners ""a world where anything is possible"". Production. Development. In 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film ""Assassins"" to Warner Brothers, and after Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy it and included two more pictures, ""Bound"" and ""The Matrix"", to the contract. The first movie the Wachowskis directed, ""Bound"", then became a critical hit. Using this momentum, the brothers later asked to direct ""The Matrix"". Producer Joel Silver soon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters like Silver and Di Bonaventura to influence the company, ""The Matrix"" was still a huge investment for Warner Bros, which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with deep philosophical ideas and difficult special effects. The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film. The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and the decision was made to film in Australia to make the most of the budget. Soon, ""The Matrix"" became a co-production of Warner Bros. and the Australian company Village Roadshow Pictures. Pre-production. The Wachowskis were keen that all involved understood the thematic background of the film. One of the requirements for actors on the film was that they had to be able to explain ""The Matrix"". The book used to conceal disks early in the film, ""Simulacra and Simulation"", a 1981 work by the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew. Reeves stated that the Wachowski brothers had him read ""Simulacra and Simulation"", """", and ""Evolutionary Psychology"" even before they opened up the script, and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved. Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process. The directors had also long been admirers of Hong Kong action cinema, so they decided to hire the Chinese director and martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping to work on fight scenes. To prepare for the wire fu, the actors were required to train intensively for months. The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training. Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were. Yuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor's strength. He built on Reeves' diligence, Fishburne's resilience, Weaving's precision, and Moss's feminine grace. Yuen designed Moss' moves to suit her deftness and lightness. Prior to the pre-production, Reeves had suffered two-level fusion of his cervical spine and his legs had been becoming paralyzed, so he had undergone a neck surgery. He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film. Weaving had to undergo surgery on his hip after suffering an injury during training. Production design. In the film, the code that comprises the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters. This code utilizes a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and numerals. The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors. Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsey Fleay and Justen Marshall. The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, ""Ghost in the Shell"", which had a strong influence on the ""Matrix"" series (see below). It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game """", and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the ""Matrix"" series. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence. ""The Matrix""s production designer, Owen Paterson, used methods to distinguish the ""real world"" and the Matrix in a pervasive way. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the ""real world"". In addition, The Matrix sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic, and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the ""real world"", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors. The ""Nebuchadnezzar"" was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on films like ""Star Trek"". The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as ""a marriage between Man and Machine"". For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used, and sinister. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester went into hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated. Kym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume. For example, Reeves' office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled, and out of place. Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider acting practicality. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their dress, or work the wires when strapped to the harnesses. For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbs and reflects different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character. For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film ""JFK"". The sunglasses, a staple to the film's aesthetics, were commissioned for the film to designer Richard Walker from sunglass maker Blinde Design. Filming. All but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, Australia, and in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included in order to maintain the impression of a generic American city. The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center. The principal photography took 118 days. Due to Reeves' neck injury, some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much physical exertion, such as the scene in Thomas Anderson's office, the interrogation room, or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle. Locations for these scenes included Martin Place's fountain in Sydney, half-way between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself. During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work. Moss performed the shots featuring Trinity at the beginning of the film and all the wire stunts herself. The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of ""Dark City"", which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films. During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it. The dojo set was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Because of Reeves's injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to the filming, he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel. For the subway scene, the set was first planned to be shot in a real subway station, but due to the amount of the actions and the wire works, the decision was made to shoot on set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski, Reeves' stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees, and a dislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot where Neo was slammed into a booth. The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view of the building was a large, several-story high sheet of background. The helicopter was a full-scale light-weight mock-up, and its blades were added post-production by the visual effects team. To prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost 15 pounds and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look. The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography. According to ""The Art of the Matrix"", at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film. Visual effects. The film is known for popularizing a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", which allows a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed. Bullet time has been described as ""a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix"", and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters' exertion of control over time and space. The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. When John Gaeta read the script, he pleaded with an effects producer at Manex Visual Effects to let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film's visual effects supervisor. The method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera is a still-picture camera not a motion picture camera, and it contributes just one frame to the video sequence. When those pictures are shown in sequence, they create the effect of ""virtual camera movement""; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time. The bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion. The cameras' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect. When the frames are put together, the resulting slow-mo effects approached the equivalent of 12,000 frames per second, as opposed to the normal 24 fps of film. Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side. To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture. The photo-realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene, and linear interpolation filled in any gaps of the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion; the computer-generated ""lead in"" and ""lead out"" slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene. Manex Visual Effects used a cluster farm running the Unix-like operating system FreeBSD to render many of the film's visual effects. Manex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass. The photogrametric and image-based computer-generated background approaches in ""The Matrix""s bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"". The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters' motions and expressions. It also led to the development of ""Universal Capture"", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras. Sound effects and music. Dane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scenes sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, came from using junk to create noises and capturing them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human baby closing required almost fifty sounds put together. The film's score was composed by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene. In addition to Davis' score, ""The Matrix"" soundtrack also features music from acts such as Rammstein, Rob Dougan, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, Ministry, Deftones, Monster Magnet, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Marilyn Manson. Influences. ""The Matrix"" draws from and makes reference to numerous cinematic and literary works, and concepts from mythology, religion and philosophy. The premise of ""The Matrix"" can be tied into Plato's Allegory of the Cave. According to Plato's theory of Forms, the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality. Plato compares people uneducated in this theory to being chained in a cave. A fire glows behind them and they see the shadows of objects cast on the wall, but not the actual objects themselves. These people perceive the shadows as reality and thus do not know the true form of the objects, and therefore, are confined to this false perception. The Matrix, or rather the AI that runs it, recalls Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise can be found in Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. ""The Matrix"" also touches on ideas from Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, Judaism, and Christianity. ""The Matrix""'s premise resembles the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. Andrew Godoski from ""Screened.com"" observed Neo's ""virgin birth"", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many Christianity references. In ""The Matrix"", a copy of Jean Baudrillard's ""Simulacra and Simulation"" is visible on-screen, and Morpheus quotes its phrase ""desert of the real"". The book was required reading for the actors prior to filming. Baudrillard himself said that ""The Matrix"" misunderstands and distorts his work. Interpretations of ""The Matrix"" often reference Baudrillard's philosophy to demonstrate that the film is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries. The influence of the matrixial theory of Bracha Ettinger articulated in a series of books and essays from the end of the 1980s onwards was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel. ""The Matrix"" belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as ""Neuromancer"" by William Gibson; for example, the film's use of the term ""Matrix"" is adopted from Gibson's novel. After watching ""The Matrix"", Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was ""exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis"" he had relied upon in his own writing; however, he noted that the film's Gnostic themes distinguished it from ""Neuromancer"", and believed that ""The Matrix"" was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick. Other writers have also commented on the similarities between ""The Matrix"" and Dick's work. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation such as ""Ninja Scroll"" and ""Akira"". Director Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film ""Ghost in the Shell"" was a particularly strong influence; producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for ""The Matrix"" by showing him that anime and saying, ""We wanna do that for real"". Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced ""Ghost in the Shell"", noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, ""... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that ""The Matrix"" is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios"". He stated that since ""Ghost in the Shell"" had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a ""promotional tool"". The action scenes of ""The Matrix"" were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo. The martial arts sequences were inspired by ""Fist of Legend"", a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li. The fight scenes in ""Fist of Legend"" led to the hiring of Woo-ping as fight choreographer. The film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". The pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in ""Metropolis"", and the work of M. C. Escher. The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick's """" as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making ""The Matrix"". Reviewers have commented on similarities between ""The Matrix"" and other late-1990s films such as ""Strange Days"", ""Dark City"", and ""The Truman Show"". Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series ""The Invisibles""; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film. Comparisons have also been made between ""The Matrix"" and the books of Carlos Castaneda. The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series ""Doctor Who"" has also been noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial ""The Deadly Assassin"") is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality. Release. ""The Matrix"" was released on , 1999. After its DVD release, it was the first DVD to sell more than one million copies in the US, and went on to be the first to sell more than three million copies in the US. By , 2003, one month after ""The Matrix Reloaded"" DVD was released, the sales of ""The Matrix"" DVD had exceeded 30 million copies. The Ultimate Matrix Collection was released on HD DVD on , 2007 and on Blu-ray on , 2008. The film was also released standalone in a 10th anniversary edition Blu-ray in the Digibook format on , 2009, 10 years to the day after the film was released theatrically. Box office. The film earned $171,479,930 (37.0%) in North America and $292,037,453 (63.0%) elsewhere for a worldwide total of $463,517,383. In North America, it became the fifth highest grossing film of 1999 and the highest grossing R-rated film of 1999. Worldwide it was the fourth highest grossing film of the year. As of 2012 it is placed 122nd on the list of highest grossing films of all time, and the second highest grossing film in the ""Matrix"" franchise after ""The Matrix Reloaded"" ($742.1 million). Critical reception. ""The Matrix"" received positive reviews from most critics, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.--> ""Entertainment Weekly"" called ""The Matrix"" ""the most influential action movie of the generation"". ""Rotten Tomatoes"" described it as an ""ingenious"" blend of Hong Kong action cinema, innovative visual effects and an imaginative vision. The site reported that 87% of critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10, based upon a sample of 129 reviews. At ""Metacritic"", which assigns an average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 73 upon its DVD release, based on 35 reviews. Philip Strick commented in ""Sight & Sound"", ""if the Wachowskis claim no originality of message, they are startling innovators of method,"" praising the film's details and its ""broadside of astonishing images"". Roger Ebert praised the film's visuals and premise, but disliked the third act's focus on action. Similarly, ""Time Out"" praised the ""entertainingly ingenious"" switches between different realities, Hugo Weaving's ""engagingly odd"" performance, and the film's cinematography and production design, but concluded, ""the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic ... yet another slice of overlong, high concept hokum."" Jonathan Rosenbaum of the ""Chicago Reader"" reviewed the film negatively, criticizing it as ""simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome."" Film critic Nick Davis strongly disliked ""The Matrix"", criticizing aspects such as its unoriginality and its attitudes toward race and gender (""Whatever credit the Wachowskis get for casting a woman and a black man as Neo's superiors they summarily lose by turning them into the same old pigeonholes"") and concluding, ""The Wachowski Brothers have dreamed up brand-new special effects, have raised the bar of technical accomplishment in filmmaking, only to put a pathetically hackneyed, depressingly impersonal, and politically thoughtless bit of tripe onto the screen."" Ian Nathan of ""Empire"" described Carrie-Anne Moss as ""a major find"", praised the ""surreal visual highs"" enabled by the bullet time (or ""flo-mo"") effect, and described the film as ""technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool"". Nathan remarked that although the film's ""looney plot"" would not stand up to scrutiny, that was not a big flaw because """"The Matrix"" is about pure experience"". Maitland McDonagh said in her review for ""TV Guide"", ""The Wachowskis' through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the film's lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains. ... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits."" ""Salon""s reviewer Andrew O'Hehir acknowledged that ""The Matrix"" is a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film (""It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the overamped onslaught of special effects—some of them quite amazing—will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside""), but concluded, ""as in ""Bound"", there's an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis' work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion for ""movies""—for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world—is pure and deep."" Several science fiction creators commented on the film. Author William Gibson, a key figure in cyberpunk fiction, called the film ""an innocent delight I hadn't felt in a long time,"" and stated, ""Neo is my favourite-ever science fiction hero, absolutely."" Joss Whedon called the film ""my number one"" and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, ""It works on whatever level you want to bring to it."" Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky commented, ""I walked out of ""The Matrix"" ... and I was thinking, 'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowskis basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured."" Director M. Night Shyamalan praised the Wachowskis' passion for the film, saying, ""Whatever you think of ""The Matrix"", every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!"". Director Quentin Tarantino counted ""The Matrix"" as one of his twenty favourite movies from 1992 to 2009. Awards. ""The Matrix"" received Academy Awards for film editing, sound effects editing, visual effects, and sound. The filmmakers were competing against other films with established franchises, like """", yet they won all four of their nominations. ""The Matrix"" also received BAFTA awards for Best Sound and Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects, in addition to nominations in the cinematography, production design and editing categories. In 1999, it won Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. Legacy. ""The Matrix"" had a strong effect on action film-making in Hollywood. The film's incorporation of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of ""The Matrix"" created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in ""X-Men"" (2000) and ""Charlie's Angels"" (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on ""Daredevil"" (2003). ""The Matrix""s Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000) that they might not otherwise have had. Following ""The Matrix"", films made abundant use of slow-motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them. The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including ""Max Payne"", in which the feature was explicitly referred to as ""bullet time"". ""The Matrix""s signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, in comedy films such as ' (1999), ""Scary Movie"" (2000), ""Shrek"" (2001), ""Kung Pow! Enter the Fist"" (2002); ""Marx Reloaded"" in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky; and in video games such as ""Conker's Bad Fur Day"". It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air; these included ""Charlie's Angels"" (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her; ""Equilibrium"" (2003), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo; ""Night Watch"" (2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by ""The Matrix"" and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made ""Wanted"" (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; and ""Inception"" (2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who enter a wildly malleable alternate reality by ""wiring in"". The original ""Tron"" (1982) paved the way for ""The Matrix"", and ""The Matrix"", in turn, inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a ""Tron"" sequel, ' (2010). Carrie-Anne Moss asserted that prior to being cast in ""The Matrix"", she had ""no career"". The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan-followings since ""Star Wars"", and was even briefly blamed for the shootings at Columbine High School. The combined success of the ""Matrix"" trilogy, the ""Lord of the Rings"" films and the ""Star Wars"" prequels made Hollywood interested in creating stories that could be told in trilogies. Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted, ""despite Hollywood's caution at religious movies (young moviegoers are not supposed to be into spiritual films), ""The Matrix"" managed to promote them alongside other ideas to which teenagers could relate"", such as the ""outsiderness"", choice, responsibility, faith in oneself, as well as fear of technology and authority. He concluded that ""The Matrix""s success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect. In 2001, ""The Matrix"" placed 66th in the American Film Institute's ""100 Years...100 Thrills"" list. In 2007, ""Entertainment Weekly"" called ""The Matrix"" the best science-fiction piece of media for the past 25 years. In 2009, the film was ranked 39th on ""Empires reader-, actor- and critic-voted list of ""The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time"". ""The Matrix"" was voted as the fourth best sci-fi film in the 2011 list ', based on a poll conducted by ABC and ""People"", and in 2012, the film was added to the National Film Registry for preservation. Franchise. The film's mainstream success led to the making of two sequels, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"", both directed by the Wachowskis. These were filmed back-to-back in one shoot and released in two parts in 2003. The first film's introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army. The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects. Also released was ""The Animatrix"", a collection of nine animated short films, many of which were created in the same Japanese animation style that was a strong influence on the live action trilogy. ""The Animatrix"" was overseen and approved by the Wachowskis, who only wrote four of the segments themselves but did not direct any of them; much of the project was developed by notable figures from the world of anime. The franchise also contains three video games: ""Enter the Matrix"" (2003), which contains footage shot specifically for the game and chronicles events taking place before and during ""The Matrix Reloaded""; ""The Matrix Online"" (2004), an MMORPG which continued the story beyond ""The Matrix Revolutions""; and """" (2005), which focuses on Neo's journey through the trilogy of films. The franchise also includes ""The Matrix Comics"", a series of comics and short stories set in the world of ""The Matrix"", written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the official ""Matrix"" website; they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed trade paperback volumes, called ""The Matrix Comics, Vol 1 and Vol 2"".

wikipedia-2844751," Victor Feldman  Victor Stanley Feldman (April 7, 1934 – May 12, 1987) was a British jazz musician, best known as a pianist and percussionist. Early history. Feldman caused a sensation as a musical prodigy when he was ""discovered"", aged seven. His family were all musical and his father founded the Feldman Swing Club in London in 1942 to showcase his talented sons. Feldman's first professional appearance was playing drums at No. 1 Rhythm Club as a member of the Feldman Trio with brothers Robert on clarinet and Monty on piano accordion. He featured in the films ""King Arthur Was a Gentleman"" (1942) and ""Theatre Royal"" (1943). In 1944 he was featured at a concert with Glenn Miller's AAAF band, as ""Kid Krupa"" (in reference to drummer Gene Krupa). His drums teacher Carlo Krahmer encouraged Feldman to play the vibraphone which he did first in the Ralph Sharon Sextet and later in the Roy Fox band. He worked in India in 1952 and 1953 in a band led by pianist Eddie Carroll. His vibraphone and conga drum playing were notable, but it was as a pianist that he became best known.  Later jazz and U.S. session work. Before leaving the U.K. in 1955 to work in the U.S., Feldman recorded with Ronnie Scott's orchestra and quintet from 1954 to 1955, which also featured other important British jazz musicians such as Phil Seamen and Hank Shaw. It was Scott who recommended that Feldman emigrate to the U.S., which he did in 1957. Once there, his first steady work was with the Woody Herman Herd. From there he went on to join Buddy DeFranco. He recorded with many different jazz artists, including Benny Goodman, George Shearing, Cannonball Adderley and Miles Davis, most notably on Davis' 1963 album ""Seven Steps to Heaven"", the title tune being his own composition. The 5-CD Shelly Manne Black Hawk set, originally released on LP in September, 1959, is a good representation of Feldman's unmistakable driving ""comping"" behind the soloists, helping to define the session as a valuable hard bop genre element. In 1957 Feldman settled in Los Angeles permanently and then specialized in lucrative session work for the US film and recording industry. He also branched out to work with a variety of musicians outside of jazz, working with artists such as Frank Zappa in 1967, Steely Dan in the 1970s and Tom Waits and Joe Walsh in the 1980s. Feldman died at his home, aged 53, following a heart attack. In 2009, Feldman was inducted in the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, TN.  Discography. As sideman.

wikipedia-7830441," Grandi's series  In mathematics, the infinite series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + …, also written is sometimes called Grandi's series, after Italian mathematician, philosopher, and priest Guido Grandi, who gave a memorable treatment of the series in 1703. It is a divergent series, meaning that it lacks a sum in the usual sense. On the other hand, its Cesàro sum is 1/2. Heuristics. One obvious method to attack the series is to treat it like a telescoping series and perform the subtractions in place: On the other hand, a similar bracketing procedure leads to the apparently contradictory result Thus, by applying parentheses to Grandi's series in different ways, one can obtain either 0 or 1 as a ""value"". (Variations of this idea, called the Eilenberg–Mazur swindle, are sometimes used in knot theory and algebra.) Treating Grandi's series as a divergent geometric series we may use the same algebraic methods that evaluate convergent geometric series to obtain a third value: resulting in ""S"" = 1/2. The same conclusion results from calculating −""S"", subtracting the result from ""S"", and solving 2""S"" = 1. The above manipulations do not consider what the sum of a series actually means. Still, to the extent that it is important to be able to bracket series at will, and that it is more important to be able to perform arithmetic with them, one can arrive at two conclusions: In fact, both of these statements can be made precise and formally proven, but only using well-defined mathematical concepts that arose in the 19th century. After the late 17th-century introduction of calculus in Europe, but before the advent of modern rigor, the tension between these answers fueled what has been characterized as an ""endless"" and ""violent"" dispute between mathematicians. Divergence. In modern mathematics, the sum of an infinite series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums, if it exists. The sequence of partial sums of Grandi's series is which clearly does not approach any number (although it does have two accumulation points at 0 and 1). Therefore, Grandi's series is divergent. It can be shown that it is not valid to perform many seemingly innocuous operations on a series, such as reordering individual terms, unless the series is absolutely convergent. Otherwise these operations can alter the result of summation. It's easy to see how terms of Grandi's series can be rearranged to arrive at any integer number, not only 0 or 1. "

wikipedia-16813157," Cathy Rush  Cathy Rush (born Cathy Cohen, April 7, 1947) was the head women's basketball coach at Immaculata from 1972-1977. She led Immaculata to three consecutive AIAW national titles from 1972-1974. She led the Mighty Macs to six consecutive final four appearances in her six seasons with the school, attaining a 149-15 record. Rush was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on April 7, 2008. She had also been inducted to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. A resident of Ventnor City, New Jersey, Rush grew up in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey and graduated from Oakcrest High School in 1964. She received a Bachelor of Science in 1968 and a Masters in Education in 1972, both from West Chester University. She has two children with her ex-husband, former National Basketball Association referee and Supervisor of Officials Ed T. Rush. ""The Mighty Macs"", a movie about the season leading to the winning of the first women's national basketball championship in 1972, was released in October 2011. Rush is played by Carla Gugino. Early life. Rush was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey on April 7, 1947 to John and Alice Cowan. She grew up in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, a township with over 40,000 residents in 2010, but approximately 5,000 when she was in elementary school. Her elementary school consisted of two rooms, with a single teacher for each room. One room housed the first through third grades, while the other room was for the fourth through sixth grades. When she reached eighth grade, Rush began playing basketball in the Six-on-six basketball style. Her scoring average was 30 points per game, which earned her the nickname ""Big Gun"", and she helped earn a position at the county tournament. In her freshman year, she attended the brand new Oakcrest High School. She played basketball for the high school team, and despite being a freshman, won the county scoring title. However, when she became a sophomore, she learned that the school had dropped interscholastic sports for girls. At the same time, a new teacher arrived with gymnastics experience. The teacher started a gymnastics team, and Rush thew herself into gymnastics. She was appointed team captain, and specialized in the trampoline. Although not an interscholastic activity, the team toured and put on halftime shows and demonstrations. Rush graduated from the high school in 1964. College. Rush decided to attend West Chester University in nearby Pennsylvania, majoring in physical education. She played on the basketball team for the first two years, but when the basketball coach left, she dropped basketball and switched to gymnastics. She graduated in 1968. Coaching—high school and junior high. After college she accepted a coaching position at Springfield High School in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. This was not a permanent position, as she was filling in for a teacher who was on sabbatical. Rush taught classes, while coaching the basketball, lacrosse and field hockey teams. When the teacher on sabbatical returned, she accepted a position at General Wayne Junior High in Malvern, Pennsylvania. She taught physical education and health classes during her two year stay at the school. Marriage. Ed T. Rush also attended West Chester University, but graduated in 1964, the year before Cathy arrived. They met on a date, at a basketball game in the Palestra. Cathy was a freshman at the time. They resumed dating two years later, and were married on June 1,1968. Immaculata. While Rush was at General Wayne Junior High, the coaching opportunity became available at Immaculata, an all-girls catholic school with an enrollment of 400 students. The job comes with some challenges—the gym has burned down, and there are no plans for replacement, so all games will be away games. The salary is $450 per year and the school owns a single basketball.Rush is only 22, barely older than the players she will be coaching. The five starting players are all commuters, driving to school for classes and practice. Yet Rush sees the positives, ""It seemed like the perfect job – low key, no pressure, and a way to stay busy during the winter while my husband, Ed, was traveling."" In addition to changes for Rush, the game was changing. The 1970-71 season was the first year of five player teams and the 30 second shot clock. Practices were informal—Rush brought her two young boys, still toddlers, to practice. her husband Ed, jokes, ""That's the Immaculata fastbreak: good defense, rebound, outlet pass, and then dodge the kids on the way up the court."" Rush was pleasantly surprised at the skill level of her players, and told her husband, an NBA referee, that |I have some player"". He condescendingly responded, ""Oh, yes, dear. Of course you do."" One of her strongest players was Theresa Shank (who would go on to a coaching career that earned her a spot in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame). Shank was a six foot center, who started the same year as Rush. The team started out with an 8–0 record. In their ninth game, Shank and Maureen Mooney didn't show up. They didn't have a charter bus, or even a school bus, so the players drove themselves to games. Shank and Mooney were car-pooling. When they didn't arrive for warm ups, Rush was initially angry, but as time passed, she became concerned. Just before the start of the game, the two arrived, announcing they had been in an auto accident. Mooney was shaken up, but Shank broke her collarbone. She was out for the season, and the team went 2–2 for their remaining four games. First championship. The following year, the new gym in Alumnae Hall was completed. The team would no longer have to play all of the games as visitors. However, the new gym wasn't large enough to accommodate bleachers, there was only room for a few rows of chairs. The players were responsible for setting up the chairs before the game and returning them after the game. With Shank now available, the team won all twelve of their regular season games, and earned a spot in the Regional Tournament. The Regional Tournament format included four games in three days, to reduce the cost of lodging. The Immaculata team won their first three games, and in the final game, faced Rush's alma mater, West Chester State. That game wasn't close, with West Chester State winning by 32 points 70–38. The team thought their season was over and headed home. When they arrived home, they were surprised by a welcome home pep rally. They didn't realize that the invitation for the AIAW national tournament would include regular season results—they were invited as the 15th seed of the 16 invited teams. They were one of six teams to lose a game in the regionals, and earn a spot in the first ever AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament. The team had no budget for post-season travel. The team organized raffles to sell toothbrushes to raise enough money for the trip to Illinois State University. They weren't able to raise enough money for all eleven players so only eight players, plus the coach were able to go. Even then, they had to fly stand-by to stretch their meager funds. They stayed four to a room and two to a bed, limiting their daily spending to seven dollars for meals. Their first opponent was South Dakota State. Immaculata won 60–47, to move on to the second round. The next day, they faced Indiana, and won a close game 49–46. Without any time off, they played the semifinal round against Mississippi State College, who had won the national championship the prior year. The following day, they would face West Chester College once again, the team that had beaten them by 32 a few days earlier, and the national runner-up in both 1970 and 1971. Despite Ed's lack of confidence—he cautioned Cathy—""Don’t be disappointed ""when"" you lose"", the result this time would be different. The Macs won a close game 52–48, and a pregnant Cathy Rush was the head coach of the first AIAW National Champions. On the trip home, someone arranged to upgrade the team to first class. When they arrived at the airport, the pilot asked the team to stay on the plane—a large crowd had gathered. Rush realized that her low-key job wasn't going to stay that way. As happy as they had been to win the game, the magnitude of the event didn't sink in until they came home. Only five fans had managed to travel to the tournament, but there were 500 fans at the airport when they returned. Their nickname had been simply ""Macs"". After the team won the national championship, George Heaslip, the sports editor of the Daily Local News, wrote, “One thing, for sure. They’re going to have to change that nickname. No more ‘Macs.’ How about ‘The Mighty Macs’?”. The nickname was picked up and the team have been known as the Mighty Macs ever since. The term was used for the title of the movie about their championship run. Repeat and three-peat. Rene Muth, later to become Rene Portland, the long-time Penn State women's basketball coach, was on each of the championship teams. Her father owned a hardware store, and provided some buckets which some of the parents and the nuns, banged on with wooden dowels to make noise. This was the beginning of the Bucket Brigade. The team still wore pleated tunics and Chuck Converse sneakers. Some teams wore tunics, while others wore shorts. The Immaculata team wore tunics until the end of the 1973 season, then switched to a two piece blouse and skirt. The Immaculata team again won all their regular season games in the 72–73 season, and earned a spot in the National Tournament. This year, the tournament was hosted by Queens College in New York, making travel easier. The first round game was against Florida State, which Immaculata won 59–48. The quarter-finals match was against Western Washington, which they won 66–53. They moved on to play their third game in two days in the semi-final against Southern Connecticut, one of the premier teams of that era. Southern Connecticut had a twelve point lead with three minutes to go in the game. The Macs fought back and took the lead, only to have Southern Connecticut tie the game with 26 seconds remaining. Marianne Crawford, the freshman guard for Immaculata, put up a shot, but it was coming off the rim. Theresa Shank saw it, and tipped it in as the buzzer sounded for the two point win, 47–45. The win set up the championship between Immaculata and Queens, playing on the Queens home court. The venue had a seating capacity of 3,000, Some thought the 1972 run had been a fluke, but the repeat performance was convincing fans the Immaculata team was very good. In the championship game, the final score of 59–52 is consistent with a reasonably close game, but the score was 59–37 in the fourth quarter when Rush pulled her starters and the bench players allowed the Queens team to score 15 consecutive points. The win completed the first undefeated season in US college women's basketball history, and the second consecutive National Championship for Immaculata. The Immaculata team went on to win an unprecedented third consecutive championship in the 1974 tournament. After winning a ten point victory over Kansas State, Immaculata had two close games, winning by four points over Indiana, and by two points over William Penn. In the final, Immaculata faced Mississippi State College for Women, but won by 15 points 68–53. Subsequent years. Although Shank, the leading player for the Macs, graduated in 1974, the team continued to play at a high level. In 1975, they again earned a spot in the national tournament, and reached the final game against Delta State, coached by Margaret Wade and featuring one of the best players in basketball history Lusia Harris. The Delta State fans had responded to the Bucket Brigade by acquiring wooden blocks as their own noisemakers. Unfortunately, what started as good fun turned ugly, with tempers flaring and some participants throwing dowels and blocks. When the Immaculata parents, following their tradition, brought their buckets to the game to act as noisemakers. They were met by a court order. Delta State had managed to convince a judge to issue a legal writ to bar noisemakers from the game. Delta State went on to win the game 90–81, to win the first of three consecutive championships. Immaculata made it all the way to the title game in 1976, but again faced Delta State and again Delta State prevailed, this time 69–64. In 1977 Immaculata played in the consolation game for third place and lost to Tennessee 91–71. Although finishing fourth in the nation was a significant accomplishment, the impact of Title IX was allowing many schools to offer scholarships to the best players. Rush decided to retire to raise her family, and left active coaching with a record of 149-15 for a winning percentage of 91%. Notable Firsts. First nationally televised game. The first nationally televised game is played by Maryland and Immaculata on January 27, 1975. Some sources report that Immaculata won 80–48, while others report 85–63. First women's basketball game in Madison Square Garden. Immaculata played Queens College on February 22,1975, in front of 11,969 spectators. The arena plated Helen Reddy's ""I Am Woman"" as the fans entered the arena. The game was a one point game late in the game, when a foul and a technical were called against Queens but the wrong Immaculata player went to the line. The momentum swung to Immaculata in the confusion and the Macs won a close game 65–61. First women's college team to play outside the US. Immaculata traveled to Australia in July of 1974, playing 18 games over the course of the month-long trip, the first United States college team to play a game outside the United States.  First undefeated season. The 1973 Immaculata team won all twenty of their games, counting the post-season tournament to become the first undefeated college team for a season. USA Basketball Pan American team. The USA Basketball team had had success in the Pan American games with gold medals in 1955,1959, and 1963, but had come in second place in both 1967 and 1971. In 1975, the team was determined to win the gold, and Cathy Rush was named head coach. One of the leading players on the Pan American team was Lusia Harris, whose Delta State team had beaten Immaculata in the 1975 Championship game, and would do so again in 1976. There were other notable players on the team, such as Pat Head (Summitt), Ann Meyers and others, as well as a 17 year-old high school player, Nancy Lieberman. The games were originally planned for Chile, then Brazil when Chile withdrew the offer to host, and then Mexico City, where they were eventually held in October. The team roster and coaches were identical to the US National team that placed eighth in the World Championships, held a few weeks earlier. That team finished with a disappointing 4–3 record, but lost the three games by a total of nine points. The USA's team first opponent was Mexico, a team that finished ahead of the USA at the World Championships, and would end up the silver medal winning in this competition. The USA team beat them 99–65, setting a tone for the event. The USA next beat Canada 75–56. They followed that game with a convincing 116–28 victory over El Salvador. Their following game against Cuba was the only close game, with the USA winning by six points 70–64. The USA team then went on to defeat the Dominican Republic 99–50, and Columbia 74–48. This set up the final with Brazil. The team from Brazil had beaten the USA team in the prior three Pan American competitions, and had won the gold medal in two of them. This time, the USA team won easily 74–55, earning the gold medal for the first time in twelve years. Title IX impact. The passage of Title IX improved the accessibility of women's sports at many schools, where programs had to increase funding for women's team. Ironically, it hurt Immaculata, who could not financially complete with the larger schools. They decided not to issue scholarships, which made it difficult to attract the top talent. Rush said, ""All of a sudden girls who would have been coming to Immaculata were going elsewhere...We didn’t have a chance with those players."" Eventually, the school transitioned from Division I to Division III. Rush initially opposed the decision not to offer scholarships, but over time, recognized why the decision was made. Coaching camps. Before Rush decided to retire from active coaching, she and her husband Ed started a summer baseball camp. The camp, known originally in 1971 as the Cathy Rush Basketball Camp, was renamed as the Future Stars Camps, which still operates today (as of 2012). Many notable coaches worked as counselors at some of these camps, including Geno Auriemma and Muffet McGraw. Breast cancer survivor. In 1990, Rush was diagnosed with breast cancer, but she did not want anyone to know. She went through chemotherapy successfully, and went on to become a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society. Coaching Tree. Seven coaches can trace their background to Cathy Rush: "
wikipedia-12890652," Outnumbered  Outnumbered is a British sitcom. Airing on BBC One since 2007, it stars Hugh Dennis and Claire Skinner as a father and mother outnumbered by their three children (played by Tyger Drew-Honey, Daniel Roche and Ramona Marquez). There have been four series to date: 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011. Produced by Hat Trick Productions, ""Outnumbered"" is written, directed and produced by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin, although parts of the show are semi-improvised. The programme has received critical acclaim for its semi-improvisational scripting and realistic portrayal of children and family life. Ratings have been average for its time slot, but the series has won a number of awards from the Comedy.co.uk awards, the Royal Television Society, the British Comedy Awards and the Broadcasting Press Guild. The first four series and the two Christmas Specials have been released on DVD. An American adaptation is currently being planned. The series began airing in the US on BBC America on 30 July 2011, as well as airing on PBS stations.  Other regular actors and actresses have reprises roles as supporting characters throughout the four series. Samantha Bond has appeared in all series as Auntie Angela, Sue's sister. David Ryall has appeared as Grandad, Sue and Angela's father in series 1 and 2 as well as the Christmas Specials in 2009 and 2011. Rosalind Ayres has appeared as Gran, Pete's mother in series 3, series 4 and the Christmas Special in 2012. Hattie Morahan has appeared in series 1 and 2, as well as the Christmas Specials as Jane. In June 2012, Outnumbered was recommissioned for a Christmas special in 2012 and a fifth series in 2014.  Plot. ""Outnumbered"" is centred around the Brockmans, a middle-class family living in south London, whose two parents are ""outnumbered"" by their three, somewhat unruly, children. The father, aged 50, Pete (Hugh Dennis), is a history teacher at an inner city school and the mother, aged 45, Sue (Claire Skinner), is a part-time personal assistant. The three children are: Jake (Tyger Drew-Honey), aged 15, whose teenage sarcasm and obsession with girls worries his mother, Ben (Daniel Roche) aged 13, who is hyperactive, a pathological liar, does unusual things, and is always coming up with hypothetical questions like ""who would win in a fight between..."", and Karen (Ramona Marquez), aged 11, who asks too many questions, frequently imitates a lot of what she sees on television and criticises nearly everything. Other regular characters include Sue's 51 year old new age sister, Angela Morrison (Samantha Bond), and their father Frank (David Ryall), referred to as ""Grandad"", who is in the early stages of dementia. The writers also use the popular sitcom device of the unseen character in the form of Veronica, Sue's demanding boss in series one. In series two, the device is used again, but in the form of Sue's new boss Tyson, who is revealed to be a conman who absconds in the final episode of the series. Series three introduces Rosalind Ayres as Pete's mum, referred to as ""Gran"", who is addicted to online gambling and has a growing hatred for Pete's father. Other new characters in Series 3 include Kelly (Anna Skellern), on whom Jake has a crush, Angela's new husband Brick (Douglas Hodge), who is an American therapist, and his daughter Taylor Jean, who wants to live with her mum. Also introduced is a campaigner against council plans to place speed bumps on the road (Alex MacQueen) who pesters the family. Production. ""Outnumbered"" was the first collaboration between Hamilton and Jenkin since ""Drop the Dead Donkey"" ended in 1998. It was commissioned by BBC controller Lucy Lumsden. The executive producer is Jon Rolph. Originally a 20-minute long pilot was made; this was given to Lumsden, who then commissioned six episodes. The setting for the show is Chiswick, West London, with the show being shot on location in Wandsworth. The house used for external shots is in Dempster Road, Wandsworth. During the second series, the family receive a final demand for council tax from the fictional ""Limebridge Council"", sent to the fictional address of 19 Keely Road, London, W4 2CF. The writers use improvisation in order to achieve convincing performances from the child actors. Dennis commented: ""In most sitcoms all the lines for children are written by adults. So they are speaking the words of people 30 years older. And you really want kids to have their own voices, and say their own things."" Jenkin added: You rarely get the feeling that children in sitcoms are real. They tend to be the same type of character – the smartarse who says adult things – and they are rooted to the spot, staring at the camera, because they've been told to stand in one place and say the lines. We decided to attempt to do something that hadn't been tried before, bounced some ideas around and we got very keen on this idea of involving improvisation very quickly. The fourth series began on 2 September 2011 at 9.00 pm on BBC One. After the series had aired, Tyger Drew-Honey suggested that there would be no fifth series because he and the other child actors were growing out of their roles. BBC Television's Head of Communications, Sam Hodges, reassured fans of the series that ""contrary to reports, talks are already under way regarding a new series"". Ratings. Episode ratings from BARB. Reception. Ratings. The first episode received 4.1 million viewers (25.5% of the audience share) when it began and finished with 2.8 million (19.5%) at the end, which is larger than the average 2.2 million (14%) normally attracted by television shows in its particular time slot. The audience for the second episode fell by half a million viewers, while still being the highest ranking show in its time slot, with 18% of the audience share. However, it maintained a constant audience throughout the first series, with the fourth episode attracting 2.7 million viewers (20% audience share). Critical reception. The show initially received a mixed reception, though after the second series reviews have gradually shifted towards a fairly positive tone. The ""Daily Mirror"" found the mundane settings to be similar to the American sitcom ""Seinfeld"", saying: compared to the ridiculous carry-on of ""My Family"", it's much more low-key and realistic. In fact it's so low-key, nothing actually happens, which could well be a nod to ""Seinfeld"" – the touchstone of all great sitcoms. The getting ready for school chaos is like ""Supernanny: The Movie"" only with nicer children. It's also taken a leaf out of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm's"" book with large chunks of improvisation – although the strongest language you'll find here is ""ponk"". Kevin Maher of ""The Times"" dismissed the programme, saying it was not funny or dramatic enough. He wrote: ""Outnumbered"" was at its most meretricious. For every exchange between adult and child was hijacked by a crass sitcommy need for ""sotto voce"" punchlines and knowing winks to the wings. A protracted scene in which 45-year-old dad (Hugh Dennis) was unable to wrestle a live power drill from the hands of 7-year-old son Ben (Daniel Roche), and instead had to, ho-ho, pay him £5 for the privilege, was emblematic of the show's dubious capacity for fake pay-offs. Rod Liddle, writing in ""The Sunday Times"", praised the show, although he was somewhat surprised, saying, ""An exquisitely middle-class, middle-aged domestic situation comedy set in West London – and starring one of those bloody stand-up comics who now festoons every network, it really should be hated before it is even seen. Start liking this sort of programme and you are an ace away from enjoying ""Terry and June"" and having a house that smells faintly of weak tea, Murray Mints and urine. So, maybe it's just me, but ""Outnumbered"" is very funny indeed: despite its current bout of self-flagellation, the BBC still knows how to make people laugh. Comedy may be the very last thing the corporation does well."" James Walton wrote in ""The Daily Telegraph"" that the domestic setting and more mundane storylines were a virtue, saying, ""All of this feels both carefully observed and suspiciously heartfelt. More unusually, it's not contrived. ""Outnumbered"" sticks firmly with the mundane, yet manages to be funny about it. It doesn't avoid the sheer dullness involved in family life either – but, happily, depicts it with a winning mixture of exasperation and affection."" He did, however, criticise the scheduling of the programme saying, ""Despite the very specific London setting, the series (shown in two batches of three, this week and next) will surely appeal to the parents of young children everywhere. As long, that is, as they're not asleep by 10.35pm."" In 2008 review in ""The Times"", Bryan Appleyard described ""Outnumbered"" as ""the best British sitcom in years and among the best ever""."" Awards. ""Outnumbered"" was nominated for the 2008 """"Broadcast"" Award"" for ""Best Comedy Programme"", but lost the award to ""The Thick of It"". The show was given the ""British Comedy Guide Editors' Award"" in The Comedy.co.uk Awards 2007 and the ""Best Returning British TV Sitcom"" in The Comedy.co.uk Awards 2008, beating ""Peep Show"" by six votes. In 2009, it won the Royal Television Society Award for ""Scripted Comedy"", and two Broadcasting Press Guild Awards in the same year: ""Best Comedy/Entertainment"" and the ""Writer's Award"". ""Outnumbered"" also won three awards at the 2009 British Comedy Awards: Best Sitcom, Best British Comedy and Best Female Newcomer for Ramona Marquez. At the National Television Awards in 2011, Outnumbered was nominated for Best Comedy but lost out to ITV comedy ""Benidorm"". It was nominated again the following year and won. U.S. version. Fox has announced plans to make an American version of ""Outnumbered"", created by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin. Larry Levin was to be both writer and executive producer. Bryan Gordon was to direct. ""Larry wrote a fantastic script,"" said MRC TV topper Keith Samples. ""Everything fell into place; it had a karmic feel to it. Kevin loved the original and loved what Larry did with the adaptation."" An unbroadcast pilot has been made and further scripts have been written. The pilot will be broadcast, but a date has yet to be given. DVD releases. All four seasons and the two Christmas specials are available on DVD. The first Comic Relief special is available on the Series 2 DVD, the first Sport Relief special is available on the Series 3 DVD and the second Comic Relief special is available on the Series 4 DVD. It has been said that the second Sport Relief special will either be available on the next Christmas Special DVD or the Series 5 DVD (if they will be filmed or if they have been filmed). The DVDs have been published by 2 Entertain. "

wikipedia-603641," Labor Zionism  Labor Zionism (Labour Zionism, , ""tsionut sotsialistit"") can be described as the major stream of the left wing of the Zionist movement. It was, for many years, the most significant tendency among Zionists and Zionist organizational structure. It saw itself as the Zionist sector of the historic Jewish labor movements of Eastern and Central Europe, eventually developing local units in most countries with sizeable Jewish populations. Unlike the ""political Zionist"" tendency founded by Theodor Herzl and advocated by Chaim Weizmann, Labor Zionists did not believe that a Jewish state would be created simply by appealing to the international community or to a powerful nation such as Britain, Germany or the Ottoman Empire. Rather, Labor Zionists believed that a Jewish state could only be created through the efforts of the Jewish working class settling in Palestine and constructing a state through the creation of a progressive Jewish society with rural kibbutzim and moshavim and an urban Jewish proletariat. Labor Zionism grew in size and influence and eclipsed ""political Zionism"" by the 1930s both internationally and within the British Mandate of Palestine where Labor Zionists predominated among many of the institutions of the pre-independence Jewish community Yishuv, particularly the trade union federation known as the Histadrut. The Haganahthe largest Zionist paramilitary defense forcewas a Labor Zionist institution and was used on occasion (such as during the Hunting Season) against right-wing political opponents or to assist the British Administration in capturing Jewish terrorists. Labor Zionists played a leading role in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and Labor Zionists were predominant among the leadership of the Israeli military for decades after the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. Major theoreticians of the Labor Zionist movement included Moses Hess, Nachman Syrkin, Ber Borochov and Aaron David Gordon and leading figures in the movement included David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir and Berl Katznelson. Ideology. Moses Hess's 1862 work ""Rome and Jerusalem. The Last National Question"" argued for the Jews to settle in Palestine as a means of settling the national question. Hess proposed a socialist state in which the Jews would become agrarianized through a process of ""redemption of the soil"" that would transform the Jewish community into a true nation in that Jews would occupy the productive layers of society rather than being an intermediary non-productive merchant class, which is how he perceived European Jews. Ber Borochov, continuing from the work of Moses Hess, proposed the creation of a socialist society that would correct the ""inverted pyramid"" of Jewish society. Borochov believed that Jews were forced out of normal occupations by Gentile hostility and competition, using this dynamic to explain the relative predominance of Jewish professionals, rather than workers. Jewish society, he argued, would not be healthy until the inverted pyramid was righted, and the majority of Jews became workers and peasants again. This, he held, could only be accomplished by Jews in their own country. Another Zionist thinker, A. D. Gordon, was influenced by the ""völkisch"" ideas of European romantic nationalism, and proposed establishing a society of Jewish peasants. Gordon made a religion of work. These two figures (Gordon and Borochov), and others like them, motivated the establishment of the first Jewish collective settlement, or kibbutz, Degania, on the southern shore of the Sea of Galilee, in 1909 (the same year that the city of Tel Aviv was established). Deganiah, and many other kibbutzim that were soon to follow, attempted to realise these thinkers' vision by creating communal villages, where newly arrived European Jews would be taught agriculture and other manual skills. Joseph Trumpeldor is also considered to be one of the early icons of the Labor Zionist movement in Palestine. When discussing what it is to be a Jewish pioneer, Trumpeldor stated ""What is a pioneer? Is he a worker only? No! The definition includes much more. The pioneers should be workers but that is not all. We shall need people who will be “everything” – everything that the land of Israel needs. A worker has his labor interests, a soldier his esprit de corps, a doctor and an engineer, their special inclinations. A generation of iron-men; iron from which you can forge everything the national machinery needs. You need a wheel? Here I am. A nail, a screw, a block? – here take me. You need a man to till the soil? – I’m ready. A soldier? I am here. Policeman, doctor, lawyer, artist, teacher, water carrier? Here I am. I have no form. I have no psychology. I have no personal feeling, no name. I am a servant of Zion. Ready to do everything, not bound to do anything. I have only one aim – creation."" Trumpeldor, an Anarcho-Communist Zionist, gave his life in 1920 defending the community of Tel Hai in the Upper Galilee. He became a symbol of Jewish self-defense and his reputed last words, ""Never mind, it is good to die for our country"" (En davar, tov lamut be'ad artzenu אין דבר, טוב למות בעד ארצנו), became famous in the pre-state Zionist movement and in Israel during the 1950s and 1960s. Trumpeldor's heroic death made him not only a martyr for Zionists Left but also for the Revisionist Zionist movement who named its youth movement Betar (an acronym for ""Covenant of Joseph Trumpeldor"") after the fallen hero. Albert Einstein was a prominent supporter of both Labor Zionism and efforts to encourage Jewish-Arab cooperation. Fred Jerome in his ""Einstein on Israel and Zionism: His Provocative Ideas About the Middle East"" argues that Einstein was a Cultural Zionist who supported the idea of a Jewish homeland but opposed the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine “with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power.” Instead, he preferred a bi-national state with “continuously functioning, mixed, administrative, economic, and social organizations.” However Ami Isseroff in his article ""Was Einstein a Zionist"" argues that Einstein was not opposed to the state of Israel given that Einstein declared it “the fulfillment of our dreams.” Perceiving its vulnerability after independence, he again set aside his pacifism in the name of human preservation, when president Harry Truman recognized Israel in May 1948.In the November 1948 presidential election Einstein supported former vice-president Henry A. Wallace’s Progressive Party, which advocated a pro-Soviet foreign policy – but which also at the time (like the USSR) strongly supported the new state of Israel. Wallace went down to defeat, winning no states. Parties. Initially two labor parties were founded by immigrants to Palestine of the Second Aliyah (1904-1914): the pacifist and anti-militarist Hapo'el Hatza'ir (Young Worker) party and the Marxist Poale Zion party, with Poale Zion roots. The Poale Zion Party had a left wing and a right wing. In 1919 the right wing, including Ben-Gurion and anti-Marxist non-party people, founded Ahdut HaAvoda. In 1930 Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapoel Hatzair fused into the Mapai party, which included all of mainstream Labor Zionism. Until the 1960s these parties were dominated by members of the Second Aliyah. The Left Poale Zion party ultimately merged with the kibbutz-based Hashomer Hatzair, the urban Socialist League and several smaller left-wing groups to become the Mapam party, which in turn later joined with other parties to create Meretz. The Mapai party later became the Israeli Labor Party, which for a number of years was linked with Mapam in the Alignment. These two parties were initially the two largest parties in the Yishuv and in the first Knesset, whilst Mapai and its predecessors dominated Israeli politics both in the pre-independence Yishuv and for the first three decades of Israel's independence, until the late 1970s. Decline and transformation. Already in the 1920s the Labor movement disregarded its socialist roots and concentrated on building the nation by constructive action. According to Tzahor its leaders did not ""abandon fundamental ideological principles"". However according to Ze'ev Sternhell in his book ""The Founding Myths of Israel"", the labor leaders had already abandoned socialist principles by 1920 and only used them as ""mobilizing myths"". Following the 1967 Six-Day War several prominent Labor Zionists created the Movement for Greater Israel which subscribed to an ideology of Greater Israel and called upon the Israeli government to keep and populate all areas captured in the war. Among the public figures in this movement associated with Left-wing nationalism were Rachel Yanait Ben-Zvi, Yitzhak Tabenkin, Icchak Cukierman, Zivia Lubetkin, Eliezer Livneh, Moshe Shamir, Zev Vilnay, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Isser Harel, Dan Tolkovsky, and Avraham Yoffe. In the 1969 Knesset elections it ran as the ""List for the Land of Israel"", but failed to cross the electoral threshold. Prior to the 1973 elections, it joined the Likud and won 39 seats. In 1976 it merged with the National List and the Independent Centre (a breakaway from the Free Centre) to form La'am, which remained a faction within Likud until its merger into the Herut faction in 1984. Other prominent Labor Zionists, especially those who came to dominate the Israeli Labor Party, became strong advocates for relinquishing the territory won during the Six-Day War. By the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, this became the central policy of the Labor Party under Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. What distinguishes Labor Zionism from other Zionist streams today is not economic policy, an analysis of capitalism or any class analysis or orientation but its attitude towards the peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with modern Labor Zionists tending to support the Israeli peace camp to varying degrees. This orientation towards Israel's borders and foreign policy has dominated Labor Zionist institutions in recent decades to the extent that socialist Zionists who support a Greater Israel ideology are forced to seek political expression elsewhere. In Israel the Labor Party has followed the general path of other governing social democratic parties such as the British Labour Party and is now fully oriented towards capitalism and even neo-liberalism, though recently it has rediscovered the welfare state under the leadership of Amir Peretz. The Israeli Labor Party and its predecessors have ironically been associated within Israeli society as representing the country's ruling class and political elite whereas working-class Israelis have traditionally voted for the Likud since the Begin Revolution of 1977. Labor Zionism today. Labor Zionism manifests itself today in both adult and youth organizations. Among adults, the World Labor Zionist Movement, based in Jerusalem, has affiliates in countries around the world, such as Ameinu in the United States and Australia, Associação Moshé Sharett in Brazil and the Jewish Labour Movement in the United Kingdom. Youth and students are served through Zionist youth movements such as Habonim Dror, Hashomer Hatzair and college-age campus activist groups such as the Union of Progressive Zionists of the U.S. and Canada. In Israel, Labor Zionism has become nearly synonymous with the Israeli peace camp. Usually Labor Zionist political and educational institutions activists are also advocates of a two-state solution, who do not necessarily adhere to socialist economic views. "
wikipedia-3677332," Paraxanthine  Paraxanthine, or 1,7-dimethylxanthine, is a dimethyl derivative of xanthine, structurally related to caffeine. Like caffeine, paraxanthine is a psychoactive central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. It possesses a potency roughly equal to that of caffeine and is likely involved in the mediation of the effects of caffeine itself. Production and metabolism. Paraxanthine is not produced by plants and is only observed in nature as a metabolite of caffeine and theobromine in animals. After intake, roughly 84% of caffeine is demethylated at the 3-position to yield paraxanthine, making it the chief metabolite of caffeine in the body. Certain proposed synthetic pathways of caffeine make use of paraxanthine as a bypass intermediate. However, its absence in plant alkaloid assays implies that these are infrequently, if ever, directly produced by plants. Physiological effects. Paraxanthine has a number of physiological effects on animals: Toxicity. Paraxanthine is believed to exhibit a lower toxicity than caffeine. While blood levels commensurate with average intake appear to be fairly innocuous, high blood concentrations of paraxanthine have been linked to miscarriage in pregnant mothers. "

When the monocytic cells are predominantly monoblasts, it is subclassified into monoblastic leukemia. Like myeloid leukemia, monocytic leukemia is almost always broken down into ""acute"" and ""chronic"": Acute monocytic leukemia is far more commonly referenced than the chronic variety. However, the chronic variety is a valid diagnostic entry. "
wikipedia-29550824," Kabouters  Kabouters were a Dutch anarchist group in the 1970s. It was founded by Roel van Duyn and one of its objectives was to set up an alternative society based on Van Duyn’s ideas as stated in his book,“De boodschap van een wijze Kabouter” (The Message of a Wise Kabouter). Van Duyn for some time worked at an organic farm and asked the farmer if they were going to get a harvester. “No,” the farmer responded “Noisy machines chase away the kabouters, and we need them to keep our plants healthy.” That is why Van Duyn used this image. The Kabouters were an off-shoot of Provo’s environmental White Plans and they proposed “Groenen Planen” (“Green Plans”), such as Roel van Duyn’s idea to have plants growing in boxes on top of cars and, if possible, to have the automobiles drive on sunken roadways so that pedestrians would only see a procession of moving greenery. Van Duyn actually introduced this plan as a motion before the Amsterdam City Council. The Kabouters were primarily from Amsterdam but were also active in about 35 Dutch cities. At the peak of the movement’s activity, around June 1970, about 500 people were attending the weekly open meetings, where plans and policies were discussed. A year later membership had dwindled to 20 people. The Amsterdam movement published 12 issues of the “Kabouterkrant” (Kabouter Newspaper) in 1970. The Kabouters attracted international attention when in June 1970 they won 5 of the 45 seats on the Amsterdam Gemeenteraad (City Council), as well two seats each on councils in The Hague and Leeuwarden and one seat apiece in Arnhem, Alkmaar and Leiden. Their leader in Amsterdam was Roel van Duyn, who was actually being reelected to the single seat in the City Council originally won by the Provos in 1966. The Kabouters had to decide whether to participate as a party in the national parliamentary elections, in May 1971 and the movement was divided on this issue. Many Kabouters felt that the electoral process was not anarchist and consequently they entered the elections divided, and lost. There was also disagreement among the five Kabouter members on the Amsterdam City Council. Two of them advocated the legalization of marijuana and smoked it even during sessions. Van Duyn disagreed with their tactic and also felt that it was not an important issue. These same two people threw a stink bomb during a City Council meeting, forcing the chamber to adjourn for an hour. The Kabouters most famous activity was squatting empty buildings. Such “liberation” of unused empty buildings from speculative absentee landlords was supported by Dutch public opinion. The Kabouters also operated many stores, alternative clothing factories, farms.

wikipedia-3225928," Robert Wilkins  Robert Timothy Wilkins (January 16, 1896 – May 26, 1987) was an American country blues guitarist and vocalist, of African American and Cherokee descent. His distinction was his versatility; he could play ragtime, blues, minstrel songs, and gospel with equal facility. Career. Wilkins was born in Hernando, Mississippi, 21 miles from Memphis. He worked in Memphis during the 1920s at the same time as Furry Lewis, Memphis Minnie (whom he claimed to have tutored), and Son House. He also organized a jug band to capitalize on the ""jug band craze"" then in vogue. Though never attaining success comparable to the Memphis Jug Band, Wilkins reinforced his local popularity with a 1927 appearance on a Memphis radio station. Like Sleepy John Estes (and unlike Gus Cannon of Cannon's Jug Stompers) he recorded alone or with a single accompanist. He sometimes performed as Tom Wilkins or as Tim Oliver (his stepfather's name). His best known songs are ""That's No Way To Get Along"" (to which he – an ordained minister since the 1930s – had changed the 'unholy' words to a biblical theme and since titled it ""The Prodigal Son"", covered under that title by The Rolling Stones), ""Rolling Stone"", and ""Old Jim Canan's"". Led Zeppelin also wrote ""Poor Tom"", which was believed to have been influenced by ""That's No Way To Get Along"". Alarmed by fighting at a party where he was playing, he deserted secular music and he took up the twin careers of herbalist and minister in the Church of God in Christ in the 1930s, and began playing gospel music with a blues feel. During the 1960s blues revival, the ""Reverend"" Robert Wilkins was ""rediscovered"" by blues enthusiasts Dick and Louisa Spottswood, making appearances at folk festivals and recording his gospel blues for a new audience. These include the 1964 Newport Folk Festival; his performance of ""Prodigal Son"" there was included on the Vanguard album ""Blues at Newport, Volume 2"". Wikins died on May 26, 1987 in Memphis, Tennessee, at the age of 91. "

wikipedia-12097508," Jean-François Gillet  Jean-François Gillet (born 31 May 1979 in Liège) is a Belgian professional footballer that currently plays for the Italian Serie A club Torino. A skilled goalkeeper, he is considered an expert penalty stopper. He is affectionately referred to in Italy as ""the cat from Liège"" due to his fast reflexes. He was a member of the Belgium national football team, for which he made his debut in 2009, at the age of 30. Career. Gillet grew up in the youth system of his hometown club Standard Liège and featured 3 times in the league for the senior side. In 1999, Gillet moved to Italy to join Serie B side Monza after struggling to find room in the senior set-up at Standard Liège. The following season he transfer to Bari in Serie A. Apart from a one-year loan to Treviso in 2003–04, he played for the ""galletti"" right through until the 2010-2011 season. At Bari, Gillet was regarded as one of the team's mainstays and was often linked with several top Serie A clubs; his fondness for Bari, however, made him stay with the club throughout their spells in Serie B. In the 2008-2009 season under the young manager Antonio Conte, Gillet helped lead Bari to promotion back up to Serie A. During his time at Bari, Gillet became the club's captain and also Bari's most-capped player of all-time.  In 2011, after Bari's relegation to Serie B, Gillet expressed his desire to finish out his career in Serie A and was transferred to Bologna in a deal worth 1.4 million euros. At his farewell press conference, Gillet tearfully bid farewell to his adopted home in Bari and their fans. In his first season at Bologna, Gillet immediately showed his goalkeeping abilities and was quickly taken to by the Bologna faithful. His 29 league appearances in goal helped Bologna finish 9th in the 2011-12 Serie A Season, the clubs best finish in a decade.  After a successful one-year spell at Bologna, on 5 July 2012, he moved to the newly promoted Serie A team Torino on a three-year contract. Match fixing allegations. On 16 July 2013, Gillet received a forty-three-month ban from football following his role in suspected match fixing during his time at Bari. "
wikipedia-207392," Loggerhead Shrike  The Loggerhead Shrike (""Lanius ludovicianus"") is a passerine bird. It is the only member of the shrike family endemic to North America; the related Northern Shrike (""L. excubitor"") occurs north of its range but also in the Palearctic. The bird has a large hooked bill; the head and back are grey and the underparts white. The wings and tail are black, with white patches on the wings and white on the outer tail feather. The black face mask extends over the bill, unlike that of the similar but slightly larger Northern Shrike. The bird breeds in semi-open areas in southern Ontario, Quebec and the Canadian prairie provinces, south to Mexico. It nests in dense trees and shrubs. The female lays 4 to 8 eggs in a bulky cup made of twigs and grass. There is an increase in average clutch size as latitude increases. The shrike is a permanent resident in the southern part of the range; northern birds migrate further south. The bird waits on a perch with open lines of sight and swoops down to capture prey. Its food is large insects, small birds and lizards.  Known in many parts as the ""Butcher Bird,"" it impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire before eating it, because it does not have the talons of the larger birds of prey. The bird decorates its impaled victim with feathers and bills in order to attract a mate. The population of this species has declined in the northeastern parts of its range, possibly due to loss of suitable habitat and pesticide use. ""Loggerhead"" refers to the relatively large head as compared to the rest of the body. Conservation status. The Eastern Loggerhead Shrike (""L.l. migrans"") is critically endangered in Canada. (Although only one island subspecies is legally listed as endangered in the United States, the species is declining continentwide and no longer occurs in most of the northeastern U.S.) A captive population was established at the Toronto Zoo and McGill University in 1997. In 2001 an experimental field breeding and release program managed by Wildlife Preservation Canada was established. ""Field breeding"" refers to moving captive pairs from their wintering cages at the Toronto Zoo and McGill to large enclosures within shrike habitat in Ontario where the pairs nest and raise their young and then the young are released to the wild when they'd naturally disperse from their parents. Since 2004 over 90 young have been released annually and between 2% and 6.5% of young released have successfully migrated and returned to breed in the subsequent year. Subspecies. There are ten recognized subspecies of Loggerhead Shrike: "
wikipedia-624839," Monte Carlo algorithm  In computing, a Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm whose running time is deterministic, but whose output may be incorrect with a certain (typically small) probability. The related class of Las Vegas algorithms is also randomized, but in a different way: they take an amount of time that varies randomly, but always produce the correct answer. A Monte Carlo algorithm can be converted into a Las Vegas algorithm whenever there exists a procedure to verify that the output produced by the algorithm is indeed correct. If so, then the resulting Las Vegas algorithm is merely to repeatedly run the Monte Carlo algorithm until one of the runs produces an output that can be verified to be correct. The name refers to the grand casino in the Principality of Monaco at Monte Carlo, which is well-known around the world as an icon of gambling. One-sided vs two-sided error. Whereas the answer returned by a deterministic algorithm is always expected to be correct, this is not the case for Monte Carlo algorithms. For decision problems, these algorithms are generally classified as either false-biased or true-biased. A false-biased Monte Carlo algorithm is always correct when it returns false; a true-biased algorithm is always correct when it returns true. While this describes algorithms with ""one-sided errors"", others might have no bias; these are said to have ""two-sided errors"". The answer they provide (either true or false) will be incorrect, or correct, with some bounded probability. For instance, the Solovay–Strassen primality test is used to determine whether a given number is a prime number. It always answers true for prime number inputs; for composite inputs, it answers false with probability at least 1/2 and true with probability at most 1/2. Thus, false answers from the algorithm are certain to be correct, whereas the true answers remain uncertain; this is said to be a ""(1/2)-correct false-biased algorithm"". Amplification. For a Monte Carlo algorithm with one-sided errors, the failure probability can be reduced (and the success probability amplified) by running the algorithm ""k"" times. Consider again the Solovay–Strassen algorithm which is ""(1/2)-correct false-biased"". One may run this algorithm multiple times returning a false answer if it reaches a false response within ""k"" iteration, and otherwise returning true. Thus, if the number is prime then the answer is always correct, and if the number is composite then the answer is correct with probability at least 1−(1−1/2)""k"" = 1−2""−k"". For Monte Carlo decision algorithms with two-sided error, the failure probability may again be reduced by running the algorithm ""k"" times and returning the majority function of the answers. Complexity classes. The complexity class BPP describes decision problems that can be solved by polynomial-time Monte Carlo algorithms with a bounded probability of two-sided errors, and the complexity class RP describes problems that can be solved by a Monte Carlo algorithm with a bounded probability of one-sided error: if the correct answer is no, the algorithm always says so, but it may answer no incorrectly for some instances where the correct answer is yes. In contrast, the complexity class ZPP describes problems solvable by polynomial expected time Las Vegas algorithms. , but it is not known whether any of these complexity classes is distinct from each other; that is, Monte Carlo algorithms may have more computational power than Las Vegas algorithms, but this has not been proven. Another complexity class, PP, describes decision problems with a polynomial-time Monte Carlo algorithm that is more accurate than flipping a coin but where the error probability cannot be bounded away from 1/2. Applications in computational number theory. Well-known Monte Carlo algorithms include the Solovay–Strassen primality test, the Baillie-PSW primality test, the Miller–Rabin primality test, and certain fast variants of the Schreier–Sims algorithm in computational group theory.

wikipedia-544652," Hugh Segal  Hugh Segal, CM (born October 13, 1950) is a Canadian senator, political strategist, author, and commentator. He was chief of staff to Ontario premier Bill Davis and Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney. Life and career. Segal finished second to Joe Clark in the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election. He had also briefly considered running for the leadership in 1993. Segal's political career dates back decades. He was inspired by a visit by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker to his Montreal High School the early 1960s. Segal is a graduate of the University of Ottawa. He was an aide to federal Progressive Conservative Leader of the Opposition Robert Stanfield in the early 1970s, while still a university student. At age 21, he was an unsuccessful candidate in Ottawa Centre for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1972 general election. He was defeated again in 1974.  As a member of the Big Blue Machine, Segal was a senior aide to Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Bill Davis in the 1970s and 1980s and was named Deputy Minister at age 29. From 1992 to 1993 he was Chief of Staff to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. In the 1980s and 1990s, Segal became a television pundit and newspaper columnist. In the private sector, Segal has been an executive in the advertising, brewing, and financial services industries. Political views. Segal espouses a moderate brand of conservatism that has little in common with British Thatcherism or U.S. Neo-Conservatism. He is a Red Tory in the tradition of Benjamin Disraeli and Sir John A. Macdonald. This political philosophy stresses the common good and promotes social harmony between classes. It is often associated with One Nation Conservatism. The focus is on order, good government and mutual responsibility. Individual rights and personal freedom are not considered absolute. In his book ""Beyond Greed: A Traditional Conservative Confronts Neo-Conservative Excess"" (Toronto: Stoddart, 1997), Segal sought to distinguish what he called “traditional” conservatives from neo-conservatives, notably those in the United States.  In an earlier book, his 1996 memoir ""No Surrender"" (page 225) Segal wrote: ""Progressive Conservatives cannot embrace the nihilistic defeatism that masquerades as a neo-conservative polemic in support of individual freedom and disengagement."" He went on to deplore ""American fast-food conservatism."" In a speech to the National Press Club on June 21, 1995, Segal referred to the ""selfish and directionless nature of the American revolution -- which was more about self-interest, mercantile opportunity, and who collected what tax than it was about tolerance or freedom."" Segal opposed on civil liberties grounds the imposition of the War Measures Act by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in the October Crisis of 1970. He favours strengthening Canada's military and encouraging investment, while maintaining a strong social safety net. His 1998 proposal to reduce Canada's Goods and Services Tax from 7% to 6% (and then 5%) was adopted by Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party in 2005. During his leadership campaign he stated his support for capital punishment. Segal's most recent book is ""The Long Road Back: The Conservative Journey, 1993-2006 (Toronto: HarperCollins, 2006)."" In December 2012, Segal published an essay in the Literary Review of Canada promoting the benefits of a guaranteed annual income. Senate. Segal was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 2005 by Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin.  He was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee until he ""reluctantly"" agreed to resign on the request of the government who reportedly wished to appoint a more ideologically conservative Senator to the role after the committee issued a report critical of the Conservative government's foreign aid policy. Segal insisted however that the move was an administrative one.[http://www.thestar.com/News/article/184340]  Segal is currently the Chair of the Special Senate Committee on Anti-Terrorism. Commonwealth. On July 7, 2010, he was appointed to the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group (EPG) by Secretary General Kamalesh Sharma. The group's mandate is to set out decisive recommendations on how to strengthen the Commonwealth and fulfill its potential in the 21st century. In December 2011 the federal government appointed him special envoy to the Commonwealth with the task of convincing individual countries to sign on to the EPG's 106 recommendations. Family. He is the brother of corporate executive and former university administrator Brian Segal and artist Seymour Segal. He is married to Donna Armstrong Segal, a former Ontario Ministry of Health executive. They have one daughter, Jacqueline. Academic work. Segal lives in Kingston, Ontario, and is a faculty member in Queen's University's School of Policy Studies and has also taught at the university's the School of Business/ He served as President of The Institute for Research on Public Policy, a Montreal think tank, from 1999 to 2006. He sits on the Board of Directors and is a Distinguished Fellow at the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute He is also a member of the Trilateral Commission Honours. In 2003, Segal was made a Member of the Order of Canada. Segal holds an honorary doctorate from the Royal Military College of Canada. "
wikipedia-7282357," Scarfies  Scarfies (or Crime 101 in the US release) is a low-budget 1999 New Zealand film set in the southern university city of Dunedin. The film's original title comes from the local nickname for university students, scarfie, so called because of the traditional blue and gold scarves worn by students during the city's cool winters in support of the Otago Rugby Football Union. ""Scarfies"" starts off as a light comedy centred around a group of five students who get together after moving into a flat that is seemingly abandoned, but still has the power on, making for free if filthy accommodation. The film twists into something darker part way through, with elements of both black comedy and thriller. The discovery of a large crop of marijuana being grown in the basement leads firstly to euphoria, then paranoia and arguments amongst the flatmates about what will happen when the real owners come back to collect it. When Kevin, the crop's owner appears, the students, fearing for their lives, lock him in the basement. Events unfold against a backdrop of the city's biggest sporting event for years, the final of New Zealand's national rugby championship. Despite the deliberate use of shots focusing on the city's dowdier and darker elements, much of the film's photography and soundtrack is an homage to the city, including the use of several Dunedin Sound songs in the soundtrack (top local band The Clean even make a cameo appearance during the film). The film was well-received, described as """"...the most outlandishly entertaining New Zealand film for years..."""", and did well at the box-office. "

The Crown Victoria with its flashy chrome ""basket handle"" was no more, and the acrylic glass-roofed Crown Victoria Skyliner was replaced by a new model, the retracting-roof hardtop Skyliner. The new chassis allowed the floor to be placed much lower, which in turn led to a lower and longer look overall. The major component of this chassis was a differential whose pinion gear was exceptionally low relative to the axleshafts, lower than in conventional hypoid differentials. 1957. The 223 CID (3.7 L) ""OHV"" Straight-6 continued, now with 144 hp (107 kW).

A dual 4 barrel version of the normally aspirated (non-supercharged) 312 cubic inch V8 rated at 270 HP (some sources report 285 HP) was reportedly available, although that engine option was not listed in most Ford sedan factory literature and is more commonly associated with one of the optional Thunderbird engines. This option was dubbed ""E code"" and featured a unique camshaft, cylinder heads, intake manifold and various other performance enhancements. It came standard with the deep-dish steering wheel. The radio became transistorized. There were lights for the generator and oil instead of gauges. The controls became reccesed for more safety(the Lifeguard safety package was still available) A new frame was used. It moved to perimeter rails out, so that they would fully envelope the passengers.

The line was freshened with a simulated hood scoop and dual-headlight front clip for 1958. The rectangular grille openings gave way to circles, and a simulated hood scoop was added. A new 3-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic was optional along with the 2-speed Ford-O-Matic and manual transmission. Engines were also updated, with the 272 CID dropped, the 292 CID making 205 hp (153 kW), and a new-generation 332 CID (5.4 L) ""FE"" V8 rated at 240 HP in 2 barrel form and 265 HP in 4 barrel ""Interceptor"" form. The new 352 cubic inch V8, also dubbed ""Interceptor"" and rated at 300 hp (224 kW) made its debut. Galaxie production was started in Lorain, Ohio at Ford's Lorain Assembly plant for 1958 and continued through 1959 with 102,869 Galaxies produced there. Air suspension became optional. 1959. The top-line spot for 1959 was the new Galaxie, positioned above the continued Fairlane 500. The Custom line was dropped, with Custom 300 the lowest rung on the ladder, and all 1959 Fords used the long 118 in (2997 mm) wheelbase.

wikipedia-14894608," Number matching  Number matching or matching numbers is a term often used in the collector car industry to describe cars with original major components, or major components that match one another. Many times these major components contain dates, casting numbers, model numbers, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN), stamped numbers, or codes that can match the original components that were on the car when it was new. Definition. The term ""number matching"" (or ""matching numbers"") is a term used in the collector car industry to describe the authenticity of collectible or investment quality cars. Number matching generally means that a particular car still contains its original major components or has major components that match exactly the major components the car had when it was new. These ""major components"" are not always agreed on. The appearance of a number matching car likely could not be distinguished from an original car. Major Components. These are parts such as the engine, transmission, rear-axle assembly, and frame of the car, with intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, body panels, and carburettors sometimes also considered.. Many times these components contain dates, casting numbers, model numbers, VIN, stamped numbers, or codes that can match the original components that were on the car when it was new. Minor Components. These are parts that are commonly replaced due to regular wear and tear. Parts such as the interior fabric, paint, chrome trim, brakes, instruments, electrical components and wiring are considered minor components and generally do not affect the value of the car. Verification. The numbers or casting dates on the major components of a car would be present and fall in a particular order.  For example, an engine’s assembly date would be before the build date of the car, and the casting dates would be before the assembly date of the engine because an engine assembly date (the date the engine was assembled, usually at a different location) could not be after the assembly date of the whole car. Engines are assembled prior to being installed in the car at the factory. Therefore, the assembly date of the car would have to be after the assembly date of the engine. Casting dates (the dates formed in the metal of a component at the foundry) could not be after the assembly date of the engine. And casting dates would be well in advance of the assembly date of the engine. Numbers and dates track an accurate history of how a car was built and when and where the car and the parts used to create the car were made. If a car has number matching major components it helps define how collectible a car is. Number matching cars typically will have a much greater value than non-number matching cars, because they are much rarer than non-number matching cars, and are seen as a more accurate description of how the car was built.

Ordinarily, someone who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is strictly liable to disgorge his gains. However, a ""change of position"" defense operates where it would be inequitable to compel him to make restitution. In English law, explicit recognition of the defence in response to an unjust enrichment claim was only first made in ""Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd"" 2 AC 548.  This defence was discussed in Ireland in the case of Murphy v Attorney General IR 241. "
wikipedia-4485339," Liam Gillick  Liam Gillick (born 1964) is a British conceptual artist who lives in New York City. He is often associated with the artists included the 1996 exhibit Traffic, which first introduced the term Relational Art.  Life and career. Liam Gillick graduated from Goldsmiths College in 1987 with a degree in Fine Art. In 1989 he mounted his first solo gallery exhibition, ""84 Diagrams"", Karsten Schubert, in London. Gillick has exhibited in galleries and institutions in Europe and the United States, many of which have been collaborative projects with other artists, architects, designers and writers. In 1991, together with art collector, and co-publisher of Art Monthly, Jack Wendler, Gillick founded the limited editions and publishing company G-W Press. The company produced limited editions by artists including Jeremy Deller and Anya Gallaccio.  In the early-1990s Gillick was a member of the band Soho and is credited with providing samples during their live performances. Together with Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Angela Bulloch and Henry Bond he was, ""the earliest of the YBAs""—the Young British Artists who dominated British art during the 1990s. In 2002, Gillick was selected to produce artworks for the canopy, the glass facade, the kiosks, the entrance ikon, and the vitrines, of the then-recently-completed Home Office building, a United Kingdom government department, at Marsham Street, London. In 2002, Gillick was nominated for the annual British Turner Prize.In the Winter 2006 edition of ""October"" (No. 115) Gillick's response to Claire Bishop's ""October"" article ""Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics,"" was published as ""Contingent Factors: A Response to Claire Bishop's 'Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics'."" Gillick has also contributed written articles to fine art journals Frieze and Artforum.  In 2008, Gillick was short-listed for the Vincent Award of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. In 2009, Gillick represented Germany in the Giardini Pavilions of the Venice Biennale. On October 1, 2010, in an open letter to the British Government's culture secretary Jeremy Hunt—co-signed by a further 27 previous Turner prize nominees, and 19 winners—Gillick opposed any future cuts in public funding for the arts. In the letter the cosignatories described the arts in Britain as a ""remarkable and fertile landscape of culture and creativity."" In October 2010, Gillick contributed a recipe for a vodka and lime juice-based cocktail as his participation in the Ryan Gander art project ""Ryan's Bar."" The beverage titled ""Maybe it would be better if we worked in groups of two and a half,"" was sold for £50 per serving. In 2010, Gillick composed a score of ""zingy electronica"" for the artists' film ""Beijing,"" made by his wife Sarah Morris. Together with others including Ingrid Schaffner and Tirdad Zolghadr, Gillick is one of the Graduate Committee of the ""Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture"" at Bard College Annandale-on-Hudson. He has been on the faculty of Columbia University, School of the Arts in New York since 1997. Gillick is represented in the UK by Maureen Paley, in New York by Casey Kaplan and in Ireland by Kerlin Gallery. Artistic practice. Gillick's artistic output is characterized by diversity, as Caoimhin Mac Giolla Leith, of University College Dublin, has said, ""Gillick's practice to date has encompassed a wide range of media and activities (including sculpture, writing, architectural and graphic design, film, and music) as well as various critical and curatorial projects, his work as a whole is also marked by a fondness for diversions and distractions, tangents and evasions."" The focus of Gillick' practice is evaluations of the aesthetics of social systems with a focus on modes of production rather than consumption. He is interested in forms of social organization. Through his own writings and the use of specific materials in his artworks, Gillick examines how the built world carries traces of social, political and economic systems. As art critic Ina Blom has said,  ""Artists such as Liam Gillick ... no longer address abstraction as the principle for the creation of distinct minimalist objects, but rather try to create through design spaces for open social interaction whose actual use is to be constantly redefined within the situation of the exhibition - without necessarily producing relational-aesthetic models of community."" Central to Gillick's practice are the publication that function in parallel to his artworks. An anthology of these ""Allbooks"" was published by Book Works, in 2009. Documents Series with Henry Bond. Between 1990 and 1994, Gillick collaborated with artist Henry Bond on their Documents Series a group of eighty-three fine art works which appropriated the ""modus operandi"" of a news gathering team, in order to produce relational art. In order to make the work the duo posed as a news reporting team—i.e., a photographer and a journalist—often attending events scheduled in the Press Association's Gazette—a list of potentially newsworthy events in London. Bond worked as if a typical photojournalist, joining the other press photographers present; whilst Gillick operated as the journalist, first collecting the ubiquitous Press kit before preparing his audio recording device. The series was first shown commercially in 1991, at Karsten Schubert Limited and then, in 1992, at Maureen Paley's Interim Art —two of the galleries that were pioneers in the development of the YBA art movement. The series was subsequently exhibited at Tate Modern, in the show ""Century City"" held in 2001, and at the Hayward Gallery, in the exhibition ""How to Improve the World"", in 2006. Exhibitions. Solo exhibitions include ""The Wood Way"" at Whitechapel Gallery in London 2002, ""A short text on the possibility of creating an economy of equivalence"" at Palais de Tokyo in Paris 2005, and the retrospective project ""Liam Gillick: Three perspectives and a short scenario"" 2008-2010. ""Liam Gillick: Three perspectives and a short scenario"" was created through the collaboration of four international art museums: the Kunsthalle Zurich, the Witte de With in Rotterdam, Kunstverein München, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. The U.S. presentation of the exhibition was the most comprehensive of Gillick’s work in an American museum. Accompanying his solo exhibition at the MCA was the show ""The one hundred and sixty-third floor: Liam Gillick Curates the Collection,"" curated by Gillick from the MCA collection. Personal life and family. Gillick is cousin to British artists James Gillick and Theodore Gillick. In the early 1990s he was in a relationship with artist Angela Bulloch. He married fellow artist Sarah Morris, in 1998 at a ceremony in Miami. Family relatives include the sculptor Ernest Gillick, the medallionist Mary Gillick, and the pro-life activist Victoria Gillick.

The area code has been in use since November 1, 1999; it was assigned to the area, instead of suburban Chicago, after a successful petition led by local resident Robert Osband to commemorate the Space Coast's impact on the county. The code refers to the countdown sequence which has launched many spacecraft from Cape Canaveral.  Part of 321 also overlays area code 407 in the Orlando area. 321 is the only area code in North America that is the overlay of one established area code and the sole area code elsewhere.  This is also the one area code currently used with SatCom Satellite Phone units. Harris/Caprock Corporation also has Maritime satellite calls going through their Corporate Call Center in Melbourne, FL which use 321 area code. "
wikipedia-5123457," Weissenhof Estate  The Weissenhof Estate (or Weissenhof Settlement; in German Weißenhofsiedlung) is a housing estate built for exhibition in Stuttgart in 1927. It was an international showcase of what later became known as the International style of modern architecture. History and description. The estate was built for the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition of 1927, and included twenty-one buildings comprising sixty dwellings, designed by seventeen European architects, most of them German-speaking. The German architect Mies van der Rohe was in charge of the project on behalf of the city, and it was he who selected the architects, budgeted and coordinated their entries, prepared the site, and oversaw construction. Le Corbusier was awarded the two prime sites, facing the city, and by far the largest budget.  The twenty-one buildings vary slightly in form, consisting of terraced and detached houses and apartment buildings, and display a strong consistency of design. What they have in common are their simplified facades, flat roofs used as terraces, window bands, open plan interiors, and the high level of prefabrication which permitted their erection in just five months. All but two of the entries were white. Bruno Taut had his entry, the smallest, painted a bright red.  Advertised as a prototype of future workers' housing, in fact each of these houses was customized and furnished on a budget far out of a normal workers reach, and with little direct relevance to the technical challenges of standardized mass construction. The exhibition opened to the public on 23 July 1927, a year late, and drew large crowds. Homes. Of the original twenty-one buildings, eleven survive as of 2006. Bombing damage during World War II is responsible for the complete loss of the homes by Gropius, Hilberseimer, Bruno Taut, Poelzig, Max Taut (home 24), and Döcker. Another of Max Taut's homes (23) was demolished in the 1950s, as was Rading's.  "
wikipedia-23465119," Obesity in pets  Obesity in pets is common in many countries. Rates of overweight and obesity in dogs in the United States ranges from 23% to 41% with about 5.1% obese. Rates of obesity in cats was slightly higher at 6.4%. In Australia, the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting has been found to be 7.6%. The risk of obesity in dogs but not cats is related to whether or not their owners are obese. In Australia, obesity ""is their most common nutritional disease."" Obese dogs and cats have a higher incidence of arthritis and heart disease. In fact, fatness to the point of health impairment is enough of a concern that Pfizer developed and got Food and Drug Administration-approval for a drug (Slentrol) to treat canine and feline obesity. Multiple pet owners have been prosecuted for cruelty to animals due to their dangerously obese dogs. Two British brothers were cited in 2006 for cruelty and neglect of their chocolate labrador retriever, ""who was allegedly made so obese by his owners that he 'looked like a seal' and could barely waddle a few steps"". Cats have also been found to suffer from morbid obesity. The primary reasons for obesity in pets is over eating and lack of physical exercise. In wealthier countries, many can afford to give their pets excessive amounts of food. Owners view food as a way to reward and treat their pets, which contributes to their overeating habits. Modern day pet foods are a higher quality food, and some pets are prone to gorging themselves to the limit of their stomach capacity, a behavior developed through evolution. In addition, pets, especially dogs, are often not allowed to free roam as they did in the past. Pets confined to a house or small yard, or who are not regularly walked or played with, are more prone to obesity. One study in cats has shown that surgical sterilization of animals increases the chances of the pet becoming overweight. According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, 53% of adult dogs and 55% of adult cats are overweight or obese. National Pet Wellness Month is October and National Pet Obesity Awareness Day is October 10. "
wikipedia-861305," FC Shakhtar Donetsk  FC Shakhtar Donetsk ( is an Ukrainian professional football club from the city of Donetsk. Shakhtar has appeared in several European competitions and currently is often a participant of the UEFA Champions League. The club became the first club in independent Ukraine to win the UEFA Cup in 2009, the last year before the competition was revamped as the Europa League. There are two Ukrainian clubs, the other one is Dynamo Kyiv, who have won a major UEFA competition. The club plays its home matches at the Donbass Arena. Shakhtar Donetsk is Ukraine's second most popular football club. The club is the sole favorite of football fans in the Donbas. The club draws its history from the very start of the Soviet football league competitions and is one of the oldest clubs in Ukraine. The club was a member of the Soviet Voluntary Sports Society of Shakhtyor, having connections with other Soviet teams from Karaganda (Kazakhstan), Soligorsk (Belarus), among others. In the late Soviet period, Shakhtar was considered a tough mid-table club of the Soviet Top League and a cup competition specialist after winning the Soviet Cup two years in a row in 1961 and 1962. The team has played under the following names: Stakhanovets (1936–1946), Shakhtyor (Shakhtar) (1946–1992), and FC Shakhtar (since 1992). History overview. Football came to the Donetsk region in the time of the Russian Empire when the industrialization of the country began. Numerous foreigners, particularly British workers, were forming their own football teams. In September 1911, at the factory of Novorossiysk Association (currently Donetsk Steel Works Factory – DMZ) owned by John Hughes was created the Yuzovka Sports Association which contained a football club as well. The football team existed until 1919. In the 1920s, the club was reorganized into the one of Vladimir Lenin's club. One of the most prominent players of that period was Viktor Shylovsky who became famous, however, playing for Dynamo Kyiv. The club Shakhtar was originally formed in May 1936 and was initially named Stakhanovets, meaning ""the participant of Stakhanovite movement,"" which derived from Aleksei Stakhanov, a coal-miner in the Donets basin and propaganda celebrity in 1935. The first team was based upon two other local teams, the participants of the All-Ukrainian Spartakiads: ""Dynamo Horlivka"" and ""Stalino"". The first game was unofficial against Dynamo Odessa and took place on 12 May 1936 at Balitsky Stadium. The team lost it 3–2 after scoring the first goal. Its first official game with ""Dynamo Kazan"" was even more disappointing, which they lost 4–1. Nonetheless, the selective job conducted constructively by the clubs administration allowed the club to compete successfully at the top level by the end 1930s. During the ""war championship"" of 1941, which was interrupted unexpectedly, the club defeated Soviet champions Dynamo Moscow and after about ten games were placed in fifth position. In the last game of that championship, they played on 24 June, two days after the start of the Great Patriotic War, which they lost at home to Traktor Stalingrad. The All-Union coal mining society of Stakhanovite had changed its name in July 1946 to Shakhtyor. In 1950 Viktor Fomin was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year, even though the club finished only 11th in the league. The first success for the team was in 1951, when it achieved third place in the USSR Championship. The most notable player of that achievement was the striker Aleksandr Ponomarev, who came to finish his football career in Donbass, the region he was born at, and was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year for 1951. Despite the latest achievement, Shakhtar was relegated at the end of the 1952 season, and as part of the re-organization of the team, the former player Aleksandr Ponomarev became the head coach of the club. In 1954, Shakhtar under Ponomarev won the Class B League, and returned to the top league. In 1958 the players of the club received less yellow and red cards then any other team in the championship, for what the Sovetsky Sport newspaper awarded the club with the ""Fair Play Award"". In the 1960s, Shakhtar, under Oleg Oshenkov’s coaching, were three-time USSR Cup finalists, winning it twice in 1961 and 1962. Among the players playing for the club then where defenders Viacheslav Aliabiev and Vladimir Salkov. The club was nicknamed “The Cup Team” due to Shakhtar’s success in vying for the trophy every year. The Miners’ more notable achievements, however, occurred later from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Despite the departure of the teams leader midfielder Anatoliy Konkov, in 1975, Shakhtar under management of former player Vladimir Salkov, earned second place in the USSR Championship and received the right to represent the Soviet Union in European competition. At the end of the season Shakhtar received the Progress Cup, for making the biggest progress from previous season in the league (they received the award again in 1977). In 1978, Shakhtar finished third in the USSR Championship. A year later, the team finished second in the league campaign and its captain — striker Vitaliy Starukhin — became the top scorer in the USSR Championship with 26 goals scored and was named the Soviet Footballer of the Year. The club was only 2 points away from the first place, despite having important players leaving the club before the season, and other important players receiving injuries. Other important players besides Starukhin at the time were Mykhaylo Sokolovsky, who went on to set a caps record for the club (for what he received the Club Loyalty Award in 1987), defenders Viktor Zvyahintsev and Valeriy Horbunov, who both made it numerous times to the 33 Top Players of the Soviet Championship lists, and goalie Yuriy Dehteryov who was named Soviet goalie of the year and took 3rd place for Soviet Footballer of the Year in 1977. Shakhtar twice, in 1980 and 1983, brought home the crystal USSR Cup to Donetsk and in 1983, it won the USSR Super Cup over then-domestic league champions Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Shakhtar reached the 1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final, and strikers Viktor Hrachov and Serhiy N. Morozov became joint top scorers of the tournament. In 1987 Shakhtar Donetsk received the smallest amount of yellow and red cards in the championship, for which the club was awarded the ""Soviet Top League Fair Play Award"" by the Man and Law Magazine. Between 1982 and 1988 Shakhtar received the ""Together With The Club"" award 5 times, an award given for good organization of home games and behavior of the home fans. In the newly independent Ukraine, Shakhtar, along with Dynamo Kyiv, became perennial first place competitors. In October 1995, a bombing-assassination took place at the team's stadium, killing team President Akhat Bragin. In the year that followed, Rinat Akhmetov took over as President and subsequently invested heavily in the club. Even though Shakhtar was not a contester for the championship at the time, finishing second many times with a big point gap from the first place, they won the Ukrainian Cup three times in 1995 (under the management of former player Vladimir Salkov), 1997 and 2001. In the 1997–98 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Shakhtar were eliminated after a 5–2 aggregate loss to Italian club Vicenza, losing the first and second legs. Important players at the time were defenders Serhiy Popov and Mykhaylo Starostyak, goalkeeper Dmytro Shutkov, striker Oleh Matveyev, who was top scorer of the Ukrainian Premier League in season 1996/97, and midfielders Hennadiy Orbu, Valeriy Kriventsov and Ihor Petrov. Most of the players plying for the team of the time came through the teams youth ranks. Towards the end of the decade, the team finally started to look like a team able to become champion. In 1999, a Shakhtar football academy was opened and now hosts football training for roughly 3,000 children. In 2000 Andriy Vorobey was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year by ""Komanda"", the first Shakhtar player in independent Ukraine to do so, and became the top scorer in the 2000–01 Ukrainian Premier League. The club won their first ever Ukrainian Premier League title in the 2001-02 season, under coach Nevio Scala, winning by a single point over Dynamo Kyiv. They were also victorious in the 2001-02 Ukrainian Cup, defeating Dynamo 3–2 after extra time in the Final. Among the main players at the club at the time were captin defensive midfielder Anatoliy Tymoschuk, striker Andriy Vorobey, midfielder Hennadiy Zubov and defender Mykhaylo Starostyak. At the end of the season Tymoschuk, who emerged as the club's leader on the field, was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year according to ""Komanda"" and ""Ukrainskiy Football"". After few manager changes, in 2004 Mircea Lucescu was invited to built a team in Shakhtar. After 10 days at the club he won the 2003–04 Ukrainian Cup, and after three month for the first time in club history the club made it to the UEFA Champions League group stage, which won him the 2004 Romania Coach of the Year title. The strategy chosen was looking for young talented players in Brazil, which will form the base of the attack, while the defense will be mostly local (in order to adjust to rules forcing teams to have a certain number of local players on the field). The big amount of Brazilian players arriving to the club through the years earned Shakhtar the nickname ""the most Brazilian club in Europe"". They won their second Premier League title in the 2004-05 season. They lost to Dynamo Kyiv in the inaugural Ukrainian Super Cup tournament in 2004. They finished as runners up in the 2004-05 Ukrainian Cup, losing to Dynamo in a penalty shoot-out the Final. They retained the Premier League crown in the 2005–06 season and managed to avenge the defeat to Dynamo in the previous Super Cup by defeating them on penalties to win their first ever Super Cup title. At the end of the season Anatoliy Tymoschuk was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year for by ""Ukrainskiy Football"" for the second time, becoming the first Shakhtar player to be named so more than once. Brazilian striker Brandao became league joint top scorer. Shakhtar appeared in all three editions of the Channel One Cup, winning the 2006 edition and finishing runners up in 2008. Having missed out on the league title in the 2006–07 season, Shakhtar regained the title in the 2007–08 season. They were also victorious in the Ukrainian Cup, defeating Dynamo Kyiv 2–0 in the final. Shakhtar's attendance levels at league matches have continually risen over the years to a point where they averaged 36,983 spectators over the 2011–12 Premier League season. In 2009, they became only the second Ukrainian team to win a European competition (and the first since independence), and the first to win the UEFA Cup, beating Werder Bremen in the final, with goals from Brazilians Luiz Adriano and Jádson. The victory earned the player Mariusz Lewandowski the 2009 Polish Footballer of the Year award. This also made them the last UEFA Cup winners before the tournament was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League. Shakhtar won the Premier League title in the 2009–10 season, goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov was named Ukraine Premier League MVP by ""Komanda"", and Manager Mircea Lucescu was named Romania Coach of the Year, for the second time. The 2010–11 season was a very successful one for Shakhtar. They reached the quarter-final stage of the Champions League, their best ever performance in the competition at that time. Captain Darijo Srna was chosen to be part of the Champions League team of the season as voted by fans. They also won a domestic treble with victory in the Premier League, Ukrainian Cup, and the Super Cup. The successful season didn't go unnoticed by the experts, and in 2011 the IFFHS gave Shakhtar a special award for making the biggest progress of the decade among football clubs. They then went on to win the Premier League and Ukrainian Cup in the 2011–12 season. Shakhtar player Yevhen Seleznyov topped the goal scoring charts in the league, with 14 goals, and manager Mircea Lucescu was named Romania Coach of the Year, for the third time. The main players at that time were captain Darijo Srna, defender Yaroslav Rakitskiy, Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan (who was named Armenian Footballer of the Year twice while playing for Shakhtar), and Brazilian midfielders Fernandinho and Willian. In the 2012-13 season Shakhtar managed to win the Premier League, Cup and Super Cup. Henrikh Mkhitaryan became the top scorer of the league, setting a Ukrainian championship record of 25 goals. Mkhitaryan was also named the Ukraine Premier League MVP by ""Komanda"" and the CIS Footballer of the Year for 2012. However, by the end of the season many of the main players of the club were sold after Shakhtar accepted high bids on them. Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Fernandinho and Willian brought the club over 100 million Euros, and Shakhtar spent the following summer trying to integrate new young players into the team, who along with the remaining players are supposed to form the backbone of the renewed Shakhtar. Despite selling it's leaders, before season 2013-14 Shakhtar set a new record for East Europe for number of season tickets sold. Stadium. Shakhtar has been playing most of its games at the RSK Olimpiyskiy stadium. The construction of a new stadium, Donbass Arena, finished and was opened on 29 August 2009. The stadium has a capacity of 50,149 and has been awarded a UEFA five star rating, the highest rating achievable. Shakhtar's old home, the central Shakhtar Stadium which was built in 1936 and reconstructed four times, is currently being used by Shakhtar Donetsk Reserves. The stadium received some major renovations, including the installation of bench seats in 2000 when Shakhtar made it to the Champions League Group Stage. A mascot mole (""moles"" is a nickname for the club) will entertain spectators during the home matches. Shakhtar are rated 40th by the average game attendance, being the top eastern European club on the rating charts. Before season 2013-14 Shakhtar set a new record for East Europe for number of season tickets sold, selling 27,000 season tickets, which means 52% of the seats in Donbass Arena belong to season tickets holders. Training Centre. Shakhtar Donetsk has its own training facilities for its first team, reserve team and youth academy all located at Kirsha Training Centre Crests and colours. The first logo of the club was designed in 1936, it featured a blue hexagon, with a red 'S' in the middle, crossed over by a jackhammer. In 1946, when the club was renamed, the logo was changed to black and white, with addition of club's name. Later, in the middle of the 1960s, their logo depicted two crossed hammers, with ""Shakhtar Donetsk"" written in the circle. The crest was added to the kit and remained there since, except for several seasons in the beginning of the 1990s. The club's name was depicted in the Russian language, until the latest logo was chosen. Therefore, some sources have its name written often as ""Shakhter"" or rarely ""Shakhtyor."" In 1989, an artist, Viktor Savilov, on the event of the club restructuring offered a draft variant of a logo with elements of the ball and a pitch. Some time later, the logo was remodelled into the present one. The emblem was added to the kit in 1997. In 2008, during the presentation of the club's new stadium, Shakhtar's new logo was unveiled. For the first time in over 30 years, the crossed hammers, the traditional symbols of the club, were present on the crest. Also, for the first time the name was written in Ukrainian language and not Russian. Former kits.  Rivalry. Shakhtar's biggest rival today is Dynamo Kyiv. The match between them has grown into what is called the Ukrainian derby. The stadiums in Kiev and Donetsk are nearly full for matches between the two teams and are the main football events within the country. The other rivalry with Metalurh Donetsk is local and, although not as significant as games against the rivals from the capital, the games between the two Donetsk teams have been proclaimed the Donetsk Derby. Among the extinguished rivalries are the games against Spartak Moscow and, particularly, the ""third place champions"" Dinamo Tbilisi of Georgia that took place at times during the Soviet Top League. Another interesting rivalry, the Donbas Derby, is with Zorya Luhansk, which gather a significant crowd in Luhansk. During the early Ukrainian championships, another interesting rivalry developed with Chornomorets Odessa labelled the ""Miners vs. Sailors,"" which declined with the turn of the millennium due to inconsistent performance of the Odessa-based club. Honours. Individual Player Awards. Several players have won individual awards during or for their time with Shakhtar Donetsk.

wikipedia-231295," Lord of Light  Lord of Light (1967) is a science fiction/fantasy novel by American author Roger Zelazny. It was awarded the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and nominated for a Nebula Award in the same category. Two chapters from the novel were published as novelettes in the ""Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction"" in 1967. Zelazny's close friend and fellow science fiction/fantasy author, George R. R. Martin, describes in his afterword to ""Lord of Light"" how Zelazny once told him that the entire novel sprang from a single pun: ""Then the fit hit the Shan."" The context of the novel – modern western characters in a Hindu-Buddhist-infused world – is reflected in the book's opening lines: Structure. The novel is structured as a series of long semi-independent chapters; each a distinct story within a long campaign by the protagonist Sam – a classic trickster character – against the established gods of the world. The stories are not presented chronologically. The first story relates Sam's return from Nirvana to continue the struggle after decades of exile. The next stories are presented as flashbacks as Sam remembers the beginning of his campaign, and the tactics he employed, leading up to the titanic battle of Keenset. In the final chapter the newly returned Sam completes his campaign against the gods, with bittersweet results. The story of Sam is based partly on the myths that surround the Buddha, the future buddha Maitreya, and Kalki, the coming tenth Avatar of Vishnu. Each chapter begins with an extract from a legendary version of the story, and extensive quotes, in English, from Indian literature such as the Sanskrit ""Vedas"" and the Pali Canon. Several events in the plot are accompanied by dialogue from the Upanishads. While his previous works such as ""...And Call Me Conrad"" and ""The Dream Master"" cast science fiction themes into a mythic mold, ""Lord of Light"" is the first to use Zelazny's technique of ""anachronistic myth,"" in which a mythical or legendary story has science-fiction underpinnings and features occurrences of 20th century American vernacular and culture: Hindu deities smoke cigarettes, characters refer to Marxism and old drinking songs like ""It's a Long Way to Tipperary"", and two characters engage in an ""Irish Stand-down,"" in which they take turns punching each other until one collapses. Zelazny deliberately mixed elements of science fiction and fantasy in this novel in which the former crew of the starship ""Star of India"" pretend to be gods by adopting the trappings of Hindu mythology, and Sam invokes Buddhism to challenge them. Zelazny noted, “""Lord of Light"" was intentionally written so that it could be taken as a science fiction or a fantasy novel. On the one hand, I attempted to provide some justifications for what went on in the way of the bizarre; on the other, I employed a style I associate with fantasy in the telling of the story. I wrote it that way on purpose, leaving some intentional ambiguity, because I wanted it to lie somewhat between both camps and not entirely in either. I did this because I did not see much stuff being written at that time which fit that description; because I wanted to see whether I could do it; and because I was curious as to how such a book would be received.”  Plot summary. ""Lord of Light"" is set on a planet colonized by some of the remnants of ""vanished Urath,"" or Earth. The crew and colonists from the spaceship ""Star of India"" found themselves on a strange planet surrounded by hostile indigenous races and had to carve a place for themselves or perish. To increase their chances of survival, the crew has used chemical treatments, biofeedback and electronics to mutate their minds and create enhanced self-images, or ""Aspects,"" that ""strengthened their bodies and intensified their wills and extended the power of their desires into Attributes, which fell with a force like magic upon those against whom they were turned."" The crew has also developed a technology to transfer a person's ""atman"", or soul, electronically to a new body. This reincarnation by mind transfer has created a race of potential immortals and allowed the former crew members to institute the Hindu caste system, with themselves at the top. The novel covers great spans of time. Eventually, the crew used their now-great powers to subjugate or destroy the native non-human races (whom they characterize as demons) while setting themselves up as gods in the eyes of the many generations of colonist progeny. Taking on the powers and names of Hindu deities, these ""gods"" maintain respect and control of the masses by maintaining a stranglehold on the access to reincarnation and by suppressing any technological advancements beyond a medieval level. The gods fear that any enlightenment or advancement might lead to a technological renaissance that would eventually weaken their power. The protagonist, Sam, who has developed the ability to manipulate electromagnetic forces, is a renegade crewman who has rejected godhood. Sam is the last ""Accelerationist"": He believes that technology should be available to the masses, and that reincarnation should not be controlled by the elite. Sam introduces Buddhism as a culture jamming tool and strives to cripple the power of the gods with this ""new"" religion. His carefully planned revolt against the gods takes place in stages: ""An army, great in space, may offer opposition in a brief span of time. One man, brief in space, must spread his opposition across a period of many years if he is to have a chance of succeeding."" In many ways, the story of ""Lord of Light"" mirrors that of the novel ""Siddhartha"" by Hermann Hesse. Characters. The novel has a range of major and minor characters, each with a backstory which, in some cases, is deliberately vague with the intent of intensifying a sense of mystery. While many of the characters bear the names of Hindu gods, wear similar clothing, and carry items that the gods are traditionally depicted with (such as Kali's necklace of skulls), they are never intended to be interpreted by the reader as Hindu gods; they are humans masquerading as gods in order to secure power. To devout Hindus the novel may appear to be blasphemous, but Zelazny was respectful of Hinduism and had clearly read widely in the subject. The gods live in Heaven, an artificial plateau in the polar regions ""where only the mighty might make their home."" It is covered by a giant dome for defense and weather control. Heaven is divided into the Celestial City and the Forest of Kaniburrha. Film version. In 1979 it was announced that ""Lord of Light"" would be made into a 50 million dollar film. It was planned that the sets for the movie would be made permanent and become the core of a science fiction theme park to be built in Aurora, Colorado. Famed comic-book artist/writer/editor Jack Kirby was even contracted to produce artwork for set design. However, due to legal problems the project was never completed. Parts of the unmade film project—the script and Kirby's set designs—were subsequently acquired by the CIA as cover for the ""Canadian Caper"": the exfiltration of six US diplomatic staff trapped by the Iranian hostage crisis (in Tehran but outside the embassy compound). The rescue team pretended to be scouting a location in Iran for shooting a Hollywood film from the script, which they had renamed ""Argo"". The story of the rescue effort was later told in the 2012 film ""Argo"". "
wikipedia-195708," Corporate identity  A corporate identity is the overall image of a corporation or firm or business in the minds of diverse publics, such as customers and investors and employees. It is a primary task of the corporate communications department to maintain and build this identity to accord with and facilitate the attainment of business objectives. It is usually visibly manifested by way of branding and the use of trademarks. Corporate identity comes into being when there is a common ownership of an organizational philosophy that is manifest in a distinct corporate culture — the corporate personality. At its most profound, the public feel that they have ownership of the philosophy. Corporate identity helps organizations to answer questions like “who are we?” and “where are we going?” Corporate identity also allows consumers to denote their sense of belonging with particular human aggregates or groups. In general, this amounts to a corporate title, logo (logotype and/or logogram) and supporting devices commonly assembled within a set of guidelines. These guidelines govern how the identity is applied and confirm approved colour palettes, typefaces, page layouts and other such. Concept. Corporate identity is often viewed as being composed of three parts: Organizational point of view. In a recent monograph on Chinese corporate identity (Routledge, 2006), Peter Peverelli, proposes a new definition of corporate identity, based on the general organization theory proposed in his earlier work, in particular Peverelli (2000). This definition regards identity as a result of social interaction: Best Practices The following four key brand requirements are critical for a successful corporate identity strategy. • Differentiation. In today’s highly competitive market, brands need to have a clear differentiation or reason for being. What they represent needs to be stand apart from others in order to be noticed, make an impression, and to ultimately be preferred. • Relevance. Brands need to connect to what people care about out in the world. To build demand, they need to understand and fulfill the needs and aspirations of their intended audiences. • Coherence. To assure credibility with their audiences, brands must be coherent in what they say and do. All the messages, all the marketing communications, all the brand experiences, and all of the product delivery need to hang together and add up to something meaningful. • Esteem. A brand that is differentiated, relevant and coherent is one that valued by both its internal and external audiences. Esteem is the reputation a brand has earned by executing clearly on both its promised and delivered experience. Visual identity. Corporate visual identity plays a significant role in the way an organization presents itself to both internal and external stakeholders. In general terms, a corporate visual identity expresses the values and ambitions of an organization, its business, and its characteristics. Four functions of corporate visual identity can be distinguished. Three of these are aimed at external stakeholders. The definition of the corporate visual identity management is: Special attention is paid to corporate identity in times of organizational change. Once a new corporate identity is implemented, attention to corporate identity related issues generally tends to decrease. However, corporate identity needs to be managed on a structural basis, to be internalized by the employees and to harmonize with future organizational developments. Efforts to manage the corporate visual identity will result in more consistency and the corporate visual identity management mix should include structural, cultural and strategic aspects. Guidelines, procedures and tools can be summarized as the structural aspects of managing the corporate visual identity. However, as important as the structural aspects may be, they must be complemented by two other types of aspects. Among the cultural aspects of corporate visual identity management, socialization – i.e., formal and informal learning processes – turned out to influence the consistency of a corporate visual identity. Managers are important as a role model and they can clearly set an example. This implies that they need to be aware of the impact of their behavior, which has an effect on how employees behave. If managers pay attention to the way they convey the identity of their organization, including the use of a corporate visual identity, this will have a positive effect on the attention employees give to the corporate visual identity. Further, it seems to be important that the organization communicates the strategic aspects of the corporate visual identity. Employees need to have knowledge of the corporate visual identity of their organization – not only the general reasons for using the corporate visual identity, such as its role in enhancing the visibility and recognizability of the organization, but also aspects of the story behind the corporate visual identity. The story should explain why the design fits the organization and what the design – in all of its elements – is intended to express. Corporate colours. Corporate colours (or company colours) are one of the most instantly recognizable elements of a corporate visual identity and promote a strong non-verbal message on the company's behalf. Examples of corporate colours: Visual identity history. Nearly 7,000 years ago, Transylvanian potters inscribed their personal marks on the earthenware they created. If one potter made better pots than another, naturally, his mark held more value than his competitors’. Religions created some of the most recognized identity marks: the Christian cross, the Judaic Star of David, and the Islamic crescent moon. In addition, Kings and nobles in medieval times had clothing, armor, flags, shields, tableware, entryways, and manuscript bindings that all bore coats of arms and royal seals. The symbols depicted a lord’s lineage, aspirations, familial virtues, as well as memoirs to cavalry, infantry, and mercenaries of who they were fighting for on the battlefields. A trademark became a symbol of individuals’ professional qualifications to perform a particular skill by the 15th century. For example, the caduceus on a physician’s sign signified that the doctor was a well-trained practitioner of the medical arts. Simple graphics such as the caduceus carried so much socioeconomic and political weight by the 16th century, that government offices were established throughout Europe to register and protect the growing collection of trademarks used by numerous craft guilds. The concept of visually trademarking one’s business spread widely during the Industrial Revolution. The shift of business in favor of non-agricultural enterprise caused business, and corporate consciousness, to boom. Logo use became a mainstream part of identification, and over time, it held more power than being a simple identifier. Some logos held more value than others, and served more as assets than symbols. Logos are now the visual identifiers of corporations. They became components of corporate identities by communicating brands and unifying messages. The evolution of symbols went from a way for a king to seal a letter, to how businesses establish their credibility and sell everything from financial services to hamburgers. Therefore, although the specific terms ""corporate image"" and ""brand identity"" didn’t enter business or design vocabulary until the 1940s, within twenty years they became key elements to business success. Visual identity designers. The visual identity design profession has substantially increased in numbers over the years since the rise of the Modernist movement in the United States in the 1950s. Media and Corporate identity. As technology and mass media have continued to develop at exponential rates, the role of the media in business increases as well. The media has a large effect on the formation of corporate identity by reinforcing a company's image and reputation. Global television networks and the rise of business news have caused the public representation of organizations to critically influence the construction and deconstruction of certain organizational identities more than ever before. Many companies proactively choose to create media attention and use it as a tool for identity construction and strengthening, and also to reinvent their images under the pressure of new technology. The media also has the power to produce and diffuse meanings a corporation holds, therefore giving stakeholders a negotiation of the organizational identity. Nation branding. The ideas of corporate identity may be applied to national identity. For example, although the United States is not a corporation, it still has organizational components and has a certain image and identity. The US is founded on certain principles, values, and beliefs, and at the same time, has a diverse and widely recognizable popular culture. Because of distinct founding principles, and the way US culture operates, the US too can be observed as a brand. Former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell once said, ""We’re selling a product. That product we are selling is democracy."" Images and identity do not always have to be planned and built by an organization, they also can be attributed to an organization by others' interpretations. During the Cold War, Coca-Cola, Marilyn Monroe, and Baywatch were booming in popularity and became obsessions of popular American culture. These images portrayed confidence and superiority in American media, therefore the USA seemed more secure and superior during the war. With the growth of the media, popular culture and celebrities still seem to define America in certain ways. Images of Brad Pitt and Mickey Mouse are easily associated to the US. The US has evolved into a nation with industries focused solely on celebrity gossip, TV shows, music, and blockbuster hits, making the US a highly-mediated nation with a strong focus on celebrity. In addition to the ""celebrity"" identity factor, there have been more strategic and patriotic images used to re-brand the country as well. After the September 11 attacks, Bush administration initiated the re-brand of the United States from ""global bully"" to a ""compassionate hegemon"". Many American citizens contributed to the act of patriotism by placing American flag bumper stickers on their cars, purple ribbons on trees in their yards, or hanging flags in their windows, all to recreate the feeling and image of nationwide pride and support.

wikipedia-72732," William Harvey Carney  William Harvey Carney (February 29, 1840 – December 9, 1908) was an African American soldier during the American Civil War. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Fort Wagner. His actions at Fort Wagner preceded those of any other black recipient. Ironically, he was not awarded the Medal of Honor for nearly 37 years after the action and thus became the last African-American to be awarded the Medal for Civil War service. The first recipient having been Robert Blake, in 1864. After the war he worked at a post office and was a guest speaker at public events until his death in 1908. Biography. Carney was born simply as ""William,"" a slave in Norfolk, Virginia on February 29, 1840. He ended up escaping through the Underground Railroad, and found his father living in Massachusetts. The two later bought the rest of their family out of slavery.  Carney served with the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry as a Sergeant. He took part in the July 18, 1863, assault on Fort Wagner in Charleston, South Carolina. He received the Medal Of Honor for saving the American flag and planting it on the parapet despite being wounded several times. Recognizing the troops had to retreat under fire, Carney struggled back across the battlefield, being wounded twice more. He eventually made his way back to the Union lines, and turned over the colors to another survivor of the 54th, modestly saying ""Boys, I only did my duty; the old flag never touched the ground!"" Later life. Carney was awarded the Medal of Honor May 23, 1900, nearly 37 years later. More than half such awards from the Civil War were presented 20 or more years after the fact.  In later life, Carney was a postal employee and popular speaker at patriotic events. He died in Boston, Massachusetts, and is buried in the family plot at Oak Grove Cemetery in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Engraved on his stone monument is a gold image of the Medal of Honor. Honors and awards. Medal of Honor citation. Rank and Organization: Citation: When the color sergeant was shot down, this soldier grasped the flag, led the way to the parapet, and planted the colors thereon. When the troops fell back he brought off the flag, under a fierce fire in which he was twice severely wounded. Other honors. The attack on Fort Wagner is depicted in the film ""Glory"". Carney's face is shown on the monument to Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th on the Boston Common designed by Augustus Saint Gaudens. The Sgt. Carney Salute—folding of a flag on a staff in a manner to allow immediate unfurling—was developed by California Scoutmaster J.S. Fox at the 1997 Boy Scout National Scout Jamboree after studying the creases and folds of Civil War Regimental Flags. A New Bedford, Massachusetts elementary school was named in his honor. "
wikipedia-17663086," Matilda House  Matilda House is one of the oldest houses in Singapore. Located in Punggol, it is very close to the Soo Teck LRT Station. The house was originally built in 1902 for Mr Joseph Cashin, whose family history in Singapore can be traced back to the early 1840s. It has entrances on two sides of the main building, an open balcony at the front facade, and a long verandah. The house is now uninhabited and is currently in ruins.  Matilda House was given conservation status by Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority in February 2000. Despite redevelopments in the surrounding area, it stands as a reminder of the past to the residents of Punggol. It is a frequent haunt for photographers, especially for those who want to take night shots of the place. Memories of Howard Cashin. The following is an extract of the newspaper interview with Mr Howard Cashin when he and the newspaper team visited the place in 2002. It was in October 2002, Mr Cashin and The New Paper team visited the Matilda house again. Mr Cashin was quite shocked by seeing its present state, and he confessed to being 'a little shaken' at seeing it in its present state. The glorious past The dilapidated framework and red corrugated roof don't do any justice to its glorious past. It had a red-tiled roof and pristine white-washed walls then. It was a sprawling, single-storey, six-bedroomed bungalow with servants quarters attached, stables on the side and set in orchards which had mangosteen, durian and rambutan trees. Manicured lawns, tropical blooms, clipped hedges lay to the front with neat tennis courts to the sides. And a long staircase ran down the garden - which was on several levels - to the sandy beach, which was a mere 200m away. Even this was not all of it. The Cashin family owned about 350 hectares of land in the area on which there were also rubber and coconut plantations. 'The last time I came here was about 10 years ago,' said Mr Cashin, looking mildly upset. His first memories of Matilda House date to the time he was about 4 years old. The Cashin family, originally from Ireland and one of the oldest to have settled in Singapore, owned several other houses here. Mr Cashin was born in their mansion in Haig Road, now no longer in existence. There was also a house on Grange Road and another in Sarimbun. In addition, the family owned other properties, including about 400 shop-houses all over the island. 'It was my grandfather, Joseph William Cashin, who made the money,' he explained. Once a lawyer's clerk, his grandfather invested in opium farms - legal in the 1880s - and made a fortune there before investing in real estate. Cashin Street, off North Bridge Road, was named after him. 'My father followed suit, but without benefit of the opium,' quipped Mr Cashin. 'He built Matilda House, and my memories of Singapore as a small boy revolve vastly around it. We could swim in the sea, but in pagars (a swimming enclosure in the sea) to keep out sharks or the occasional crocodile which would appear.' Mr Cashin later became one of this country's best-known legal eagles, and was a sparkling personality and somewhat controversial figure on the sports scene. The long-time president of the Singapore Rugby Union played on the Singapore Cricket Club rugby team and also captained its cricket team for several years. But he had left Singapore at 7 to go to school in England. And stayed there for 11 years, going later to Oxford University where he shone at cricket and rugby and qualified as a lawyer. 'I had some happy days at Matilda House when I returned just before the war,' he said. 'Then went off again.' He spent much of the war in the Indian Army, stationed at the north-east frontier. He said matter-of-factly: 'Those places they mention in Afghanistan these days... they are all familiar to me.' Immediately after, he returned to England, was called to the Bar in London and came back here to practise as a lawyer. 'I was also newly-married then,' he said. 'And we set up home in Matilda House.' Those halcyon days, when he was a 'workaholic lawyer', avid sportsman, young husband and father were evidently the happiest. His two children from that first marriage - Mary, now 48 and Charles, now 46 - spent their first years in the house. Later his brother, Mr Joseph Cashin, also a prominent lawyer here, took over the house with their mother and sister. They were asked to leave about 10 years ago and the house has lain empty, falling slowly into ruin. Mr Cashin himself had left Singapore by the late 1980s, settling in Italy with his second wife. But when that marriage was over, he returned here, to Murphy and Dunbar, the old law firm he'd been a partner in. It was dissolved in 1996 and he started his own firm. He is only semi-retired now, still taking the odd case. And is now married to Lily Cashin - also a lawyer. They now have their law firm together. And with his siblings and children all living abroad, he's the only Cashin left in Singapore now. Seeing Matilda House after all these years was an emotional experience. There's regret at the state of disrepair it has fallen into, but that's tinged with a measure of satisfaction. He said: 'I'm happy that the house will still be standing. But I hope it will be used well.' "

wikipedia-298509," La Brea Tar Pits  The La Brea Tar Pits (or Rancho La Brea Tar Pits) are a group of tar pits around which Hancock Park was formed, in urban Los Angeles. Asphaltum or tar (""brea"" in Spanish) has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of years. The tar is often covered with dust, leaves, or water. Over many centuries, the bones of animals that were trapped in the tar were preserved. The George C. Page Museum is dedicated to researching the tar pits and displaying specimens from the animals that died there. The La Brea Tar Pits are a registered National Natural Landmark. Location and formation. The La Brea Tar Pits and Hancock Park are situated within what was once the Mexican land grant of Rancho La Brea, now part of urban Los Angeles in the Miracle Mile district, adjacent to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Craft and Folk Art Museum. Tar pits are composed of heavy oil fractions called asphaltum, which seeped from the earth as oil. In Hancock Park, crude oil seeps up along the 6th Street Fault from the Salt Lake Oil Field, which underlies much of the Fairfax District north of the park. The oil reaches the surface and forms pools at several locations in the park, becoming asphalt as the lighter fractions of the petroleum biodegrade or evaporate. This seepage has been happening for tens of thousands of years. From time to time, the asphalt would form a deposit thick enough to trap animals, and the surface would be covered with layers of water, dust, or leaves. Animals would wander in, become trapped, and eventually die. Predators would enter to eat the trapped animals and also become stuck. The tar pits visible today are actually from human excavation. The lake pit was originally an asphalt mine. The other pits visible today were produced between 1913 and 1915, when over 100 pits were excavated in search of large mammal bones. Various combinations of asphaltum and water have since filled in these holes. Normally, the asphalt appears in vents, hardening as it oozes out, to form stubby mounds. These can be seen in several areas of the park. As the bones of dead animals sink into the asphalt, it soaks into them, turning them a dark-brown or black color. Lighter fractions of petroleum evaporate from the asphalt, leaving a more solid substance, which encases the bones. Apart from the dramatic fossils of large mammals, the asphalt also preserves microfossils: wood and plant remnants, rodent bones, insects, mollusks, dust, seeds, leaves, and even pollen grains. Examples of some of these are on display in the museum. Radiometric dating of preserved wood and bones has given an age of 38,000 years for the oldest known material from the La Brea seeps. The pits still ensnare organisms today, so most of the pits are fenced to protect humans and animals. History. The Native American Chumash people living in the area distinguished themselves as the finest boat builders among the California Natives. Pulling fallen Northern California redwood trunks and pieces of driftwood from the Santa Barbara Bay, Chumash ancestors soon learned to seal the cracks between the boards of the large wooden plank canoes using the natural resource of tar. This unique and innovative form of transportation allowed access up and down the coastline and on the Channel Islands. The Portolà expedition, a group of Spanish explorers led by Gaspar de Portolá, made the first written record of the tar pits in 1769. Father Juan Crespí wrote, ""While crossing the basin the scouts reported having seen some geysers of tar issuing from the ground like springs; it boils up molten, and the water runs to one side and the tar to the other. The scouts reported that they had come across many of these springs and had seen large swamps of them, enough, they said, to caulk many vessels. We were not so lucky ourselves as to see these tar geysers, much though we wished it; as it was some distance out of the way we were to take, the Governor [Portolá] did not want us to go past them. We christened them ""Los Volcanes de Brea"" ""the Tar Volcanoes"". For some years, tar-covered bones were found on the Rancho La Brea property but were not initially recognized as fossils, because the ranch had lost various animals, including horses, cattle, dogs, and even camels, whose bones closely resemble several of the fossil species. The original Rancho La Brea land grant stipulated that the tar pits be open to the public for the use of the local Pueblo. Initially, they mistook the bones in the pits for the remains of pronghorn antelope (""Antilocapra americana"") or cattle that had become mired. Union Oil geologist W. W. Orcutt is credited with first recognizing that fossilized prehistoric animal bones were preserved in pools of asphalt on the Hancock Ranch in 1901. In commemoration of Orcutt's initial discovery, paleontologists named the La Brea coyote (""Canis orcutti"") in his honor. Scientific resource. Contemporary excavations of the bones started in 1913–1915. In the 1940s and 1950s, public excitement was generated by the preparation of previously recovered large mammal bones. Subsequent study demonstrated the fossil vertebrate material was well preserved, with little evidence of bacterial degradation of bone protein. By the 1970s, research attention had shifted to smaller specimens, such as preserved insects and plant parts, including microfossils, such as pollen grains. These remains have contributed to an understanding of the Los Angeles basin during the glacial age, revealing a cooler and more moist climate. Source of methane discovered. Methane gas escapes from the tar pits, causing bubbles that make the asphalt appear to boil. Asphalt and methane appear under surrounding buildings and require special operations for removal to prevent the weakening of building foundations. In 2007, researchers from UC Riverside discovered that the bubbles were caused by hardy forms of bacteria embedded in the natural asphalt. After consuming petroleum, the bacteria release methane. Of the bacteria sampled, about 200 to 300 were previously unknown species. George C. Page Museum. The George C. Page Museum, part of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, was built next to the tar pits in Hancock Park on Wilshire Boulevard. Construction began in 1975, and the museum opened to the public in 1977. It tells the story of the tar pits and presents specimens from them. Visitors can walk around the park and see the tar pits. On the grounds of the park are life-size models of prehistoric animals in or near the tar pits. Of more than 100 pits, only Pit 91 is still regularly excavated by researchers and can be seen at the Pit 91 viewing station. Paleontologists supervise and direct the work of volunteers. Excavation of newly uncovered pits. On February 18, 2009, George C. Page Museum formally announced the 2006 discovery of 16 fossil deposits which had been removed from the ground during the construction of an underground parking garage for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art next to the tar pits. Among the finds are remains of a saber-toothed cat, six dire wolves, bison, horses, a giant ground sloth, turtles, snails, clams, millipedes, fish, gophers, and an American lion. Also discovered is a nearly intact mammoth skeleton, nicknamed Zed; the only pieces missing are a rear leg, a vertebra and the top of its skull, which was sheared off by construction equipment in preparation to build the parking structure. These fossils were packaged in boxes at the construction site and moved to a compound behind Pit 91, on Page museum property so that construction could continue. Twenty-three large accumulations of tar and specimens were taken to the Page Museum. These deposits are worked on under the name ""Project 23"". As work for the public transit Metro Purple Line is extended, museum researchers know more tar pits will be uncovered, for example near the intersection of Wilshire and Curson. Flora and fauna. Among the prehistoric species associated with the La Brea Tar Pits are mammoths, dire wolves, short-faced bears, ground sloths, and the state fossil of California, the saber-toothed cat (""Smilodon fatalis"").  Only one human has been found, a partial skeleton of the La Brea Woman dated to approximately 10,000 calendar years (~9,000 radiocarbon years) BP, who was 17 to 25 years old at death and found associated with remains of a domestic dog, and so was interpreted to have been ceremonially interred. John C. Merriam of the University of California led much of the early work in identifying species in the early 20th century. The park is known for producing myriad mammal fossils dating from the last glacial period. While mammal fossils generate significant interest, other fossils, including fossilized insects and plants, and even pollen grains, are also valued. These fossils help define a picture of what is thought to have been a cooler, moister climate in the Los Angeles basin during the glacial age. Among these fossils are microfossils, which are retrieved from a matrix of asphalt and sandy clay by washing with a solvent to remove the petroleum, then picking through the remains under a high-powered lens. Tar pits around the world are unusual in accumulating more predators than prey. The reason for this is unknown, but one theory is that a large prey animal would die or become stuck in a tar pit, attracting predators across long distances. This predator trap would catch predators along with their prey. Another theory is that dire wolves and their prey may have been trapped during a hunt.

wikipedia-92742," Baritone horn  The baritone horn is a low-pitched brass instrument. Baritone horn is a piston valve brass instrument with a predominantly cylindrical bore like the trumpet and uses a wide-rimmed cup mouthpiece like that of its peers the trombone and euphonium, for like the trombone and the euphonium, the baritone horn is pitched in B one octave below the B trumpet. In the UK the baritone is frequently found in brass bands. The baritone horn in the United States is common in school and university bands, the baritones found in school inventories often being older models as the instrument over time appears to be yielding in popularity to the euphonium. A person who plays a baritone horn is a ""baritone (horn) player or baritonist."" Construction and general characteristics. The baritone, like the trombone and euphonium is a nine-foot brass tube. Valves are most often piston-style. It is predominately of cylindrical bore, in contrast to the more conical bore of the euphonium, rendering its attack more distinct than the rounder attack of the euphonium. Key. The baritone is pitched in concert B meaning that when no valves are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B harmonic series. Music for the baritone horn can be written in either the bass clef or the treble clef. When reading from the bass clef, the baritone horn is a non-transposing instrument. However, when written in the treble clef it is often used as transposing instrument, transposing downwards a major ninth, so that written middle C for the baritone is concert B below low C, with the fingerings thus matching those of the trumpet but sounding an octave lower. It is often used to play parts written for the similarly pitched tenor trombone or euphonium. Range. The baritone is part of the low brass section of the band. Its second partial with no valves pressed is concert B on the second line from the bottom of the bass clef. The eighth partial with no valves pressed is concert B in the center of the treble clef. Experienced amateur players can often reach a fifth above that to the concert F at the top of the treble clef, with higher notes reachable by the virtuoso. The slightly erroneous diagram at the right shows the range ascending from the first partial with all valves pressed, i.e., the lowest fundamental available being concert third low F. In reality, the lowest B baritone fundamental with all valves pressed is concert third low E, a semitone below the note shown in the diagram. Tone. The baritone sounds with a timbre between the brightness of the trombone and the more mellow tone of the euphonium. Distinguishing the Baritone Horn from the Euphonium. Although both baritone horn and euphonium produce partials of the B harmonic series in the same range, and both have a nine-foot-long main tube, the baritone horn tends to have a smaller and more cylindrical bore than the euphonium. The baritone horn usually has a tighter wrap and a smaller bell, and is thus smaller and lighter overall, and produces a ""lighter"" sound versus the more solid, brassy timbre of the euphonium.  There is some confusion of nomenclature in the United States due to the old practice of American euphonium manufacturers calling their professional models by their proper names, and branding entry-level student models as baritones. This practice has nearly stopped. True baritone horns are sometimes called ""British-bore Baritones"" in the US to avoid this confusion. Another common misconception is that the three-valve instrument is a baritone and that the four-valve instrument is a euphonium. Euphoniums often have a fourth valve as an alternate fingering for 1&3 split fingering with improved intonation. The fourth valve can also be viewed in the same way as an F trigger on trombone, repitching the instrument to expand the lower range. The fourth valve is less common to nearly nonexistent on baritones, but absence of a fourth valve is not a defining characteristic. An ""American baritone"", featuring three valves on the front of the instrument and a curved forward-pointing bell, was common in American school bands throughout most of the twentieth century. While this instrument is in reality a conical-cylindrical bore hybrid, neither truly euphonium nor baritone, it was almost universally labeled a ""baritone"" by both band directors and composers.  Marching Baritone Horn. Specially wrapped versions of the baritone horn have been created for use in marching bands and Drum and Bugle Corps. They have 3 valves and a front-facing bell and are the tenor voice of a drum and bugle corps, below the soprano voice of the trumpet, the alto voice of alto horn or mellophone, and above the low contrabass bugles or tubas. Over the past several decades, the baritone advanced in the drum and bugle corps due to certain rule changes. Up until 1977, baritone bugles, as with all bugles at the time, were restricted to one horizontal piston valve and one rotary valve. That year, the Drum Corps International rules congress passed a rule allowing 2 vertical piston valves. The rules were amended once more in 1989 permitting the addition of a third valve. From the 1950s until 2000, all drum and bugle corps were required to use instruments pitched in the key of G. That year, Drum Corps International changed its rules again, allowing instruments in any key, with most other major organizations (e.g. Drum Corps Associates) following suit soon after. Since this change, the standard baritone has been the instrument pitched in B. Some high school and college bands do not use marching baritones and continue to use upright-bell front baritone horns on the field. Some marching bands substitute a section of baritones for the trombone or euphonium section. Artists. The baritone horn has largely receded into the background in the concert band world of today. Notable artists who are today referenced as great baritone horn and/or euphonium players include Mel Sykes, Simone Mantia, and Leonard Falcone. The Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival is a notable venue for aspiring artists on euphonium, but its namesake played baritone horn on his many recordings. Legendary trumpeter Maynard Ferguson used a baritone horn in the song ""Gospel John"" and in one of his three solos (the other two involving a valved trombone and a trumpet) in a live performance of one of his songs ""Great Guns"". "
wikipedia-190988," Bibliography  Bibliography (from Greek , ""bibliographia"", literally ""book writing""), as a discipline, is traditionally the academic study of books as physical, cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as bibliology (from Greek , ""-logia""). Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic, description of books as physical objects (descriptive bibliography). Branches of bibliography. Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic, description of books as physical objects (descriptive bibliography). These two distinct concepts and practices have separate rationales and serve differing purposes. Innovators and originators in the field include W. W. Greg, Fredson Bowers, Philip Gaskell, and G. Thomas Tanselle.  Bowers (1949) refers to enumerative bibliography as a procedure that identifies books in “specific collections or libraries,” in a specific discipline, by an author, printer, or period of production (3). He refers to descriptive bibliography as the systematic description of a book as a material or physical artifact. Analytical bibliography, the cornerstone of descriptive bibliography, investigates the printing and all physical features of a book that yield evidence establishing a book's history and transmission (Feather 10). It is the preliminary phase of bibliographic description and provides the vocabulary, principles and techniques of analysis that descriptive bibliographers apply and on which they base their descriptive practice.  Descriptive bibliographers follow specific conventions and associated classification in their description. Titles and title pages are transcribed in a quasi-facsimile style and representation. Illustration, typeface, binding, paper, and all physical elements related to identifying a book follow formulaic conventions, as Bower's established in his foundational opus, ""The Principles of Bibliographic Description."" The thought expressed in this book expands substantively on W. W. Greg’s groundbreaking theory that argued for the adoption of formal bibliographic principles (Greg 29). Fundamentally, analytical bibliography is concerned with objective, physical analysis and history of a book while descriptive bibliography employs all data that analytical bibliography furnishes and then codifies it with a view to identifying the ideal copy or form of a book that most nearly represents the printer’s initial conception and intention in printing.  In addition to viewing bibliographic study as being composed of four interdependent approaches: enumerative, descriptive, analytical, and textual, Bowers notes two further subcategories of research, namely historical bibliography and aesthetic bibliography. Both historical bibliography, which involves the investigation of printing practices, tools, and related documents, and aesthetic bibliography, which examines the art of designing type and books, are often employed by analytical bibliographers. D. F. McKenzie extended previous notions of bibliography as set forth by W. W. Greg, Bowers, Gaskell and Tanselle. He describes the nature of bibliography as ""the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception"" (1999 12). This concept broadens the scope of bibliography to include ""non-book texts"" and an accounting for their material form and structure, as well as textual variations, technical and production processes that bring sociocultural context and effects into play. McKenzie's perspective contextualizes textual objects or artifacts with sociological and technical factors that have an effect on production, transmission and, ultimately, ideal copy (2002 14). Bibliography, generally, concerns the material conditions of books well as other texts how they are designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted, collected. Bibliographic works differ in the amount of detail depending on the purpose and can generally be divided into two categories: enumerative bibliography (also called compilative, reference or systematic), which results in an overview of publications in a particular category and analytical or critical bibliography, which studies the production of books. In earlier times, bibliography mostly focused on books. Now, both categories of bibliography cover works in other media including audio recordings, motion pictures and videos, graphic objects, databases, CD-ROMs and websites. Enumerative bibliography. An enumerative bibliography is a systematic list of books and other works such as journal articles. Bibliographies range from ""works cited"" lists at the end of books and articles to complete, independent publications. A notable example of a complete, independent publication is Gow's, ""A. E. Housman: A Sketch, Together with a List of His Classical Papers"" (1936). As separate works, they may be in bound volumes such as those shown on the right, or computerized bibliographic databases. A library catalog, while not referred to as a ""bibliography,"" is bibliographic in nature. Bibliographical works are almost always considered to be tertiary sources. Enumerative bibliographies are based on a unifying principle such as creator, subject, date, topic or other characteristic. An entry in an enumerative bibliography provides the core elements of a text resource including a title, the creator(s), publication date and place of publication. Belanger (1977) distinguishes an enumerative bibliography from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list, rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source's physical nature, materiality or textual transmission. The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective. One noted example would be Tanselle's bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography. A more common and particular instance of an enumerative bibliography relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper.  Citation styles vary. An entry for a book in a bibliography usually contains the following elements: An entry for a journal or periodical article usually contains: A bibliography may be arranged by author, topic, or some other scheme. Annotated bibliographies give descriptions about how each source is useful to an author in constructing a paper or argument. These descriptions, usually a few sentences long, provide a summary of the source and describe its relevance. Reference management software may be used to keep track of references and generate bibliographies as required. Bibliographies differ from library catalogs by including only relevant items rather than all items present in a particular library. However, the catalogs of some national libraries effectively serve as national bibliographies, as the national libraries own almost all their countries' publications. Descriptive Bibliography. Fredson Bowers described and formulated a standardized practice of descriptive bibliography in his ""Principles of Bibliographical Description""  (1949). Scholars to this day treat Bowers' scholarly guide as authoritative. In this classic text, Bowers describes the basic function of bibliography as, "" sufficient data so that a reader may identify the book described, understand the printing, and recognize the precise contents"" (124). Descriptive Bibliographies as Scholarly Product. Descriptive bibliographies as a scholarly product usually include information on the following aspect of a given book as a material object: Analytical bibliography. This branch of the bibliographic discipline examines the material features of a textual artifact – such as type, ink, paper, imposition, format, impressions and states of a book – to essentially recreate the conditions of its production. Analytical bibliography often uses collateral evidence – such as general printing practices, trends in format, responses and non-responses to design, etc. – to scrutinize the historical conventions and influences underlying the physical appearance of a text. The bibliographer utilizes knowledge gained from the investigation of physical evidence in the form of a descriptive bibliography or textual bibliography. Descriptive bibliography is the close examination and cataloging of a text as a physical object, recording its size, format, binding, and so on, while textual bibliography (or textual criticism) identifies variations – and the aetiology of variations – in a text with a view to determining ""the establishment of the most correct form of text (Bowers 498[1). Etymology. The word ""bibliographia"" (βιβλιογραφία) was used by Greek writers in the first three centuries AD to mean the copying of books by hand. In the 12th century, the word started being used for ""the intellectual activity of composing books"". The 17th century then saw the emergence of the modern meaning, that of description of books. Currently, the field of bibliography has expanded to include studies that consider the book as a material object. Non-book material. Systematic lists of media other than books can be referred to with terms formed analogously to ""bibliography"": Arachniography is a term coined by NASA research historian Andrew J. Butrica, which means a reference list of URLs about a particular subject. It is equivalent to a bibliography in a book. The name derives from ""arachne"" in reference to a spider and its web. Bibliography as a field of study. Bibliography is a specialized aspect of library science (or library and information science, LIS) and documentation science. The founder of documentation, Paul Otlet wrote about ""the science of bibliography"". However, there have recently been voices claiming that ""the bibliographical paradigm"" is obsolete, and it is not today common in LIS. A defense of the bibliographical paradigm was provided by Hjørland (2007). The quantitative study of bibliographies is known as bibliometrics, which is today an influential subfield in LIS. "

Fresh's hit single ""The Show"". ""The Showstopper"" was produced by Hurby Azor. The song utilized a melody from the 1984 film ""Revenge of the Nerds"". The finished recording garnered some airplay on a New York City rap radio program. The independent Pop Art Records gave it an official release, and ""The Showstopper"" became a modest R&B hit. Albums. ""Hot, Cool & Vicious"". With the success of Showstopper, the group's name was changed to Salt-N-Pepa (which they had called themselves in the first verse of the song) and they signed to the independent Next Plateau Records to record a full-length album. Roper then joined the group as the DJ, replacing DJ Latoya Hanson as Spinderella, and the group's first album ""Hot, Cool & Vicious"" was released afterwards in 1986. The album was produced by Hurby ""Luv Bug"" Azor, Salt's boyfriend at the time and also the group's manager. Years later, the women would have legal issues with Azor as they accused him of paying unfair royalties. ""Hot, Cool & Vicious"" provided some moderate R&B hits with the singles ""My Mic Sound Nice"", ""Tramp"", and ""Chick On The Side"". But when San Francisco DJ and producer Cameron Paul created a remix to ""Push It"", the B-side of the ""Tramp"" single, it gave the group their first major hit. ""Push It"" (US #19, UK #2) became a platinum single in the United States, and a hit in several other countries, and was added to subsequent pressings of ""Hot, Cool & Vicious"". It was nominated for a Grammy Award, and the strength of that single catapulted the album to platinum sales in the US with one million sold, making Denton, James, and Roper the first female rap act (group or solo) to go gold or platinum. The album ultimately sold 1.3 million copies worldwide. ""A Salt with a Deadly Pepa"". Salt-N-Pepa's next album release, 1988's ""A Salt with a Deadly Pepa"", contained the Top Ten R&B hit and moderate pop hit ""Shake Your Thang"", featuring the go-go band E.U. A top 20 R&B hit and a minor pop hit were also seen in ""Get Up Everybody (Get Up)"" and ""Twist and Shout"" (UK #4), respectively; with ""Twist and Shout"" becoming a major hit in the UK on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at #4, and several other European countries. The album sold about 800,000 copies worldwide with roughly 600,000 of those in the US, attaining gold status. ""Blacks' Magic"". The group's third album ""Blacks' Magic"" was released in March 1990, and was a personal album for the trio on many fronts. Pepa would become the first group member to become pregnant. Azor would produce some songs on the album, but often late or a no show to recording sessions, as he was producing other acts, he agreed to let the artists work with different producers to finish the album. James and Roper took on producing assignments themselves and the trio also hired different producers such as Invincible's producer Dana Mozie. This was the first album to feature Roper on vocals as well as DJ'ing. The result was six singles released by Next Plateau Records, several of which became hits: ""Expression"" (US #26, UK #40 in ""1990"", UK #23 in ""1992""), a platinum single that had been certified gold before it even cracked the US Hot 100 as it had already been #1 on the R&B Chart for 8 weeks, and produced by Salt; ""Independent""; ""I Don't Know"" (featuring Kid N Play); ""Do You Want Me"" (US #21, UK #5), certified gold; ""Let's Talk About Sex"" (US #13, UK #2), certified gold, and later re-recorded as ""Let's Talk About Aids""; and ""You Showed Me"" (UK #15). The album ultimately sold 1.5 million copies worldwide with a million of those sold in the US. A greatest hits album called ""A Blitz of Salt-N-Pepa Hits"", featuring some remixed versions of songs from the group's first three albums was subsequently released. ""Very Necessary"". Salt-N-Pepa's fourth studio album ""Very Necessary"" was released in October 1993 on London Records/Polygram. The album featured songwriting and production by Salt, Pepa, Spinderella, and Azor. Buoyed by the hits ""Shoop"" (US #4, UK #13), co-produced by Pepa; ""Whatta Man"" (US #3, UK #7) (featuring En Vogue); and ""None of Your Business"", a Top 40 US hit and a Top 20 UK hit, the album eventually sold seven million worldwide, with five million of those in the US (5x platinum), making them the first female rap act (solo or group) to have a multi-platinum selling album. The group toured and Salt went on to co-star in the motion picture comedy ""Who's the Man?"". Pepa co-starred in the movie ""Joe's Apartment"". Pepa had also been romantically involved with Treach of the rap group Naughty By Nature. The trio won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1995 for the single ""None Of Your Business"", making them the first female rap Grammy winners. The album is the best selling album by a female rap act. ""Brand New"". By the time of their next album release, Salt-N-Pepa had gone through the legal process of completely breaking away from Azor, whom they accused of unfair royalty payments. Salt had already stopped being romantically involved with him due to their many ups-and-downs. The trio also left London Records after one album and signed with Red Ant Records, though still distributed by Polygram Records through its Island Records label. Red Ant offered the trio a $30 million signing bonus to sign with them. The group undertook production duties once again but without Azor involved in any part of the album. The result was their fifth album, ""Brand New"" (1997), which hit stores a few months later. However, Red Ant filed for bankruptcy soon afterwards, halting promotion on all its releases, including Salt-N-Pepa's album. The group toured in support of the album, but without any promotion or marketing from the now-defunct Red Ant, they only scored minor hits in ""R U Ready"" and ""Gitty Up"". The album was certified gold in the US for sales of over 500,000 and sold approximately another 200,000 worldwide. Although not as big a seller as its predecessor, it kept intact an unbroken string of gold and platinum studio album releases by the trio. Disbanding. In March 1999, Salt-N-Pepa embarked on a tour. Pepa married Treach of Naughty by Nature on July 27, 1999, earning them the unofficial title of hip-hop's number-one couple. Salt-N-Pepa's greatest-hits album, entitled ""Salt-N-Pepa: The Best Of"", was released in Europe on January 25, 2000. Pepa and Treach would remain married for two years but their tumultuous marriage would end in divorce on July 31, 2001. With no albums contractually due at the time, Salt decided to quit the group, stating she had enough with the music industry and no longer wanted to be involved in it. They officially disbanded in 2002. Some time later, Salt announced that she would be releasing her first solo album, but she subsequently did not release the product. She was featured on the remix version of the Salt City Six's ""Shine"", on the album ""Holy South: World Wide"", a compilation of Christian rap and Christian R&P (Rhythm & Praise) songs. The album was executive produced by ex-Three 6 Mafia member turned Christian rapper Mr. Del. Salt also revealed in later interviews that she had suffered from bulimia many years ago. Pepa appeared on the fifth season of VH-1's ""The Surreal Life"". She released an autobiography entitled ""Let's Talk About Pep"" in August 2008. The book was co-written by author Karen Hunter and offers a glimpse behind the fame, family, failures, and successes of Pepa's life, as well as being a member of one of hip-hop's most successful acts. It features an introduction by Queen Latifah, and an epilogue by Missy Elliott. To accompany the book, she also launched her own social network for her fans at http://www.LetsTalkAboutPep.com. She also starred in the reality TV series ""Let's Talk About Pep"" on the VH-1 network. Spinderella is a radio personality on KKBT 100.3 in Los Angeles, California. She hosted ""The Backspin"" (with DJ Mo'Dav), a nationally-syndicated weekly radio show featuring old school hip hop music. She is also periodically a DJ at various club events. Re-forming. Both Salt and Pepa appeared on VH-1's ""Hip Hop Honors"" in November 2004, as the trio were honorees. All three women reunited the following year for the next ""Hip Hop Honors"" program and performed ""Whatta Man"" with En Vogue. It was the trio's first performance in six years, and was their first ever performance of ""Whatta Man"" with En Vogue on stage. Salt-N-Pepa reformed in 2007. All three women now have children. Spinderella has a daughter with former NBA player Kenny Anderson. Her daughter has appeared on MTV's ""My Super Sweet Sixteen"" in 2008. Pepa has a son and a daughter. Salt has a daughter and a son. On October 14, 2007, ""The Salt-n-Pepa Show"" debuted on VH1. Pepa initially started the formation of the series as she had previously appeared on the network in ""The Surreal Life"". ""The Salt-n-Pepa Show"" chronicled events in the lives of Pepa and Salt as they work out past issues and return to the recording studio. Spinderella has been featured in several episodes. Later in 2008, the trio performed with MC Lyte, Yo-Yo, and Lady of Rage at the BET Hip Hop Awards. On May 9, 2009 Salt-N-Pepa performed a concert in Honolulu, Hawaii along with SWV and Lisa Lisa.

wikipedia-32134118," Interruption science  Interruption science is the ""study of the effect of disruptions on job performance"". Office workers face a number of interruptions due to e-mail, phone calls, and visits from co-workers, all of which may be annoying and affect their productivity. For professions such as jet pilots or nurses, interruptions could have major consequences, as they could lead to costly or even life-threatening errors. Interruptions arising from Notifications. Notifications have become a constant presence in modern day life. We receive notifications from various sources, whether they be a message from a friend or a weather advisory. Often, notifications do not appear at optimal times and detract from other activities. In the office workplace, notifications may be particularly disruptive. Different context surrounding notifications determines their impact. As a result, research has been conducted to discover solutions for problems caused by notifications, while also keeping in mind the benefits they produce. Categories of notifications. Notifications are alerts relating to emails, mobile devices such as cell phones and other PDAs. These notifications are dependent upon the technology associated with them and these sorts of notifications arise from the use of electronic devices .As group collaboration has increased significantly with groups that are not necessarily collocated, the dependence upon electronic devices has therefore increased causing the amount of notifications users get to increase as well. The increased dependence upon technology has led to these notifications becoming more frequent and, as a result, causing more interruptions in the work place. These devices can be configured in order to make a sound or vibrate in order to alert the user that they have new messages or to remind the user of a task that must be completed. Notifications either have set schedules or occur spontaneously due to various reasons, such as new emails and text messages. Because of the growing numbers of various electronic devices used, the amounts of notifications users receive grow exponentially. Different types of notifications are: 1) Text messaging (SMS) 2) Voice (telephone, cellphone, VoIP, outdoor loudspeaker, indoor PA system) 3) E-mail (POP, IMAP, SMTP) 4) Desktop alert (dialog, balloon, modal window, toast) 5) Pager (SNPP)* Instant messaging (IRC, ICQ, AIM, Yahoo! Messenger, MSN, XMPP, iMessage) 6) RSS (RSS reader, digital signage) 7) Web page (Javascript, XML) 8) Fax Notification system definition. The purpose of notification systems is to deliver messages to a set of recipients. Notifications within the system each consist of information that is current and important, and originate from a particular source consistent with the system. The need to repeatedly check a source for information is eliminated with a proactive system of notifications, because the system does the ""checking"" action automatically. Using a notification system increases overall awareness and consists of visual, auditory, or haptic alerts. Most notifications traditionally appear instantly and require some cognitive attention to be successful in transmitting information. Furthermore, notification systems are not designed to require complete attention, but are not necessarily successful in that goal. In general, notification systems are used for making information widely available, for communicating, and for being aware of friends' activities.  Notifications as interruptions. The question arises as to when notifications become interruptions to other tasks. An interruption, by definition, is a distraction that causes one to stop a scheduled task to respond to a stimulus. Interruptions can cause serious task completion issues. According to the New York Times, 40 percent of the time, interruptions cause employees in a workplace to change course completely after being distracted. Workers cannot remember what they were doing before the distraction. Answering notifications hurts task performance and the ability to resume to the original task at hand. However, the general consensus among workers is that the increased situational awareness created by having the interruptions is worth the decrease in concentration. The forced absence of email notifications, in a study, helped some workers concentrate, but others felt the constant need to check their email accounts. Without notifications, people often spend more time checking their email overall than they did with notifications, due to the lack of constant awareness. The absence of email notifications is often seen as counterproductive because of the required ""catch-up"" time periods after a long time between email checking. Email notifications appear with a brief summary message, and are not as distracting as they are perceived to be because employees in a workplace customarily glance at most email notifications with passive awareness, if they are not important. Email notifications do become very distracting when they are set to appear instantly or every 5 minutes. Email notifications are not as distracting as they are often thought to be, but still do cause issues while working. In general, not all notifications have the same effect, either because of the variety of people who receive the notification or the properties of the notification. Some workers have the ability to multitask more than others, and do not feel that using notifications hurts their work progress. Auditory notifications have varying levels of distractedness based on the voice providing the notification. The most disruptive auditory alerts are found to be when one's own voice is heard, followed by a familiar voice, followed then by an unfamiliar voice as the least distracting. A visual graphic has been found to be less distracting than auditory and written alerts. Notifications have varying effects on a worker's concentration. Current plans disrupted. Notifications may be relevant to the task that the worker is currently completing or not. When a notification is relevant to the current task and may even help with the task, the notification is less disruptive than if it were unrelated. Additionally, if the notification is relevant to an employee's job and the project he or she is working on is also part of his or her job, the interruption is not distracting from the general category of work. Overall task performance is most impacted when an instant message is received during fast and stimulus-driven tasks such as typing, pressing buttons, or examining search results. Moreover, there is debate over the impact of task type on ease of interruption. One study claims that cognitive tasks are less easily interrupted by message notifications than list evaluation tasks. A study showed that people take longer to respond to a notification when working on a cognitive task, such as evaluating search results based on an idea, than an evaluating for an exact response. The reason for this finding may be that cognitive tasks already hold one's focus, and that focus is not easily lost by a notification. On the other hand, a comprehensive book explains that the more in-depth the context of a task is when interrupted, the more detrimental the notification. The potential impact of a notification is determined, in part, by the task it is interrupting. Impact of notifications at different points of task completion. Notifications that appear early in the completion of a task have more of a disruption effect than do interruptions late in the completion of a task. This fact has been attributed to workers being less rehearsed in a task at the out start, rather than later on in the project timeline. The worker has not had the chance to become invested in the beginning of a project, and is easily distracted. However, when notifications occur at breakpoints, breakpoints being transitions between two sections of a task, instead of during busy moments, there is less frustration and time spent avoiding the notification. Notifications have more of an impact at certain point of progress within task completion than at others. Interruptions In Office Work. According to Gloria Mark, a leader in interruption science, the  average knowledge worker switches tasks every three minutes, and, once distracted, a worker takes nearly a half-hour  to resume the original task.” Gloria Mark conducted a study on office workers, which revealed that ""each employee spent only 11 minutes on any given project before being interrupted"" and that it took, ""on average, 25 minutes to return"" to their initial task. At the same time, Mark's study indicated that constant e-mail interruptions are also an important source of information for office workers.  A study indicates that ""employers seeking to decrease interruptions may want to have their workers use instant messaging  software"". The study showed that ""workers who used instant messaging on the job reported less interruption than colleagues who did not"". Even though ""using instant messaging led to more conversations on the computer, ...the conversations were briefer"". Interruptions to Pilots and Health care Professionals. For professions such as jet pilots, astronauts, or surgeons in the operating room, interruptions at the wrong time could even have major consequences. Mary Czerwinski, ""one of the world's leading experts in interruption science"" helps ""NASA design the information systems for the International Space Station"". She has to try to figure out how to ""deliver an interruption to a busy astronaut"" regarding mechanical errors without being ""too distracting, it could throw off the astronauts and cause them to mess up million-dollar experiments"". In nursing, a study has been conducted of the impact of interruptions on nurses in a trauma center. Another study has been done on the interruption rates of nurses and doctors. Interruption caused by smart phone use in health care settings can be deadly. Hence, it may be worthwhile for health care organizations to craft effective cell phone usage policies to maximize technological benefits and minimize unnecessary distraction associated with smart phone use.  Solutions to interruptions from notifications. Because of the rapid increase in the use of technology, the number of interruptions that have been caused by notifications has increased, as well. Since users have placed a heavy reliance upon technology, users face notification overload, or the challenge of keeping up to date on incoming information alerts. These notifications have been proven to affect the productivity of the receivers. Measures have been put into place to try and reduce the interruptions of the people who receive them. In order to reduce the negative effects of receiving constant notifications while working, applications have been developed that attempt to reduce the distractions caused by numerous notifications. The applications in development use a variety of methods to either try and classify notifications by their importance or to deliver notifications when there is an identified break from work. These applications try and allow the delivery of notifications to be least harmful in order to allow productivity to remain unaffected by the delivery of such alerts.  Due to the fact that a notification is generally presented in the same format for all messages, messages that do not have high importance cause unnecessary interruptions with harmful effects on the receiver. Software, such as ""Oasis"", have been developed to filter messages and classify them by priority level.This software makes users aware of the importance of their email alerts or other messages, as well as which messages are most time sensitive. ""Oasis"" compiles notifications from various sources in order to reduce the amount of time spent scanning external locations. A program called ""Scope"" is a visual notification organization system that sorts emails into different categories, has reminders for meetings, and has reminders for tasks that must be completed. The purpose of these types of software is to effectively reduce the interruptions caused by electronic devices and to ensure that interruptions become more beneficial than harmful. They aim to allow users to effectively integrate notifications into their workload without the loss of productivity that is usually associated with receiving notifications. These programs are developed through the monitoring of emails, phone calls, and text messages. The data obtained is then used to decide whether or not the user is involved in a process that will be negatively impacted by receiving a notification. These programs have been deemed effective in numerous work places, as they have minimized the loss of production that users experience when receiving notifications. Although there will continue to be an increase in the amount of notifications users receive as more technology is used in work spaces, the use of applications such as ""Oasis"" and ""Scope"" will limit the interruptions user experience and reduce a loss of productivity. Bounded deferral. Bounded deferral is a restricted notification method that entails users waiting a prescribed amount of time before they access a notification to reduce the amount of interruption and decline in productivity. This technique was used in the aim to provide calmer and less disruptive work spaces. If users are busy, alerts and notifications are put aside and delivered only when users are in a position to receive notifications without harming their work. The bounded deferral method has proven to be useful and has the potential to become even more effective on a wider scale, as it has showed how an effective notification system can operate. Email solutions. In regard to emails, researchers encourage people to try to limit their usage of email dialogue boxes, sound alerts, and the frequency that they are updated about new emails. Employees in a workplace are discouraged from using the reply-to-all feature to prevent unnecessary distractions to peers who will find not find the email useful. Users are urged to avoid reply-to-all because when the reply-to-all feature is used, there is a high probability that the response is only beneficial for few people. One method that users can utilize to reduce the interruptions of emails is to configure the email application to give concise summaries of each email received, including the sender, the subject, and a few lines of the message. This allows users to acknowledge whether or not they have to give immediate action to their emails and allows them to forgo wasting time reading the email. Another method that limits the disruptions caused by emails is to configure the email application to check for new emails no more frequently than 45 minutes to allow workers to remain productive for prolonged periods of time. Teaching people within an organization to effectively use emails and how to set the priority of their emails should be used to reduce the interruptions caused by notification. "

wikipedia-4611195," Pakistan Rangers  The Pakistan Rangers () are part of the Paramilitary forces of Pakistan, and consists of members of the Pakistan Army under the direct control of the Ministry of the Interior of the Pakistan Government. The Rangers are an internal security force with the prime objective to provide and maintain security in war zones and areas of conflict as well as maintaining law and order which includes providing assistance to the police. Prior to 1995, the Pakistan Rangers were two separate forces: the Pakistan Rangers Punjab headquartered in Lahore, Punjab, and the Mehran Force headquartered in Karachi, Sindh. The two forces maintain their different uniforms and chains of command but work under same ordinances, such as the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance 1959. Each evening, Pakistan Rangers stationed in Lahore, together with their counterparts in the Indian Border Security Force, participate in a flag lowering ceremony at Wagah. History. The origins and roots of Rangers dates back to 1942, when British government established a special unit as Sindh Police Rangers. After the establishment of Pakistan in 1947, the protection of its eastern boundaries was allotted to particular forces, such as the Punjab Border Police Force, Bahawalpur State Police, Khairpur State Police and Sindh Rifles. Because the Rangers were neither correctly structured nor outfitted for a specific duty, in 1958, they were restructured and renamed as the West Pakistan Rangers. The current Sindh Rangers is a combined force constituted in the early 90's for a strategic anti-dacoit operation in the interior of Sindh. The force operated under the name of Mehran Force and included the then existing Sindh Rangers, 3 Battalions of Pakistan Army (inc. SSG), Northern Scouts. This force was commanded by Major General Saleem Ishaq Khan. It was this force constitution that eventually became the modern day Sindh Rangers. War performances. The Rangers had fought together with the Pakistan Army in several conflicts, namely the 1965 Indo-Pak war and 1971 Indo-Pakistan War. After the 1971 war, the force was federalized underneath the Ministry of Defence as the Pakistan Rangers, and, shortly in 1974, it was made a component of the Civil Armed Forces (CAF) under the Ministry of Interior. Pakistan Rangers guard the borders during peace and war. In 1995, the Mehran Force was merged into the Pakistan Rangers (Sindh). The Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) are credited for providing the Pakistan Army troops for Special Police Units in Kosovo and Haiti Peace mission every year. These troops are entrusted with the task to provide protection and security to UN officials, provide operational and backup support, respond to threats to public order in coordination with the Kosovo administration, and assist humanitarian agencies. The Rangers also had participated in numerous special military operations along with Pakistan Army Special Forces branch in the past. Since their revitalization and re-building after the 1971 war, the Rangers have been involved in the numerous special military operations in Pakistan. The Rangers have also assisted the Army's Special Service Group in performing special operations. They first participated in 1973, when they, based on the intelligence reports, had successfully accompanied the SSGs to raid the Iraqi Embassy. In 1992, the Rangers were deployed to Karachi, and the Government of Sindh had used Rangers to keep peace in the city. The Rangers had also participated in Operation Blue Fox in 1992 along with the Army. Due to their close association with the Army, the Rangers also fought in Indo-Pakistani War of 1999 (Best known as Kargil War) deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. Despite the fact of it being a paramilitary force, the Government of Pakistan had recognized the Rangers as its one its special forces in 2004. The Rangers were among one of the special forces that participated in Operation Silence and accompanied Army Commandos in the operation. During the operation, the Rangers suffered a single casualty. In 2009, Rangers completed a special military operation in Lahore alongside the Special Service Group, when terrorists attacked the Manawan Police Academy. While it was led by the Pakistan Rangers, the operation, codenamed Lahore Police Academy Operation, ended with eight militant deaths with one captured. The same year, the Government of Pakistan deployed the Rangers to secure the outskirts of Islamabad when Taliban forces had taken over the Buner, Lower Dir, Swat and Shangla districts. Its members also participated in Operation Black Thunderstorm while securing the capital. Currently, there are Rangers deployed in Karachi. Leadership. Pakistan Rangers are divided into two separate branches: Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) and Pakistan Rangers (Punjab). Each branch is headed a Director General appointed by the Pakistan Army after the clearance from the Chief of Army Staff. The Director General of the Pakistan Rangers currently holds the 2-star rank of Major-General. The current Director General of Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) is Major General Rizwan Akhter, whereas Director General of Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is Major General Mian Muhammad Hilal Hussain. A similar paramilitary force in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is called the Frontier Corps. Role. The Rangers are tasked with securing important monuments and guarding national assets in all major cities of Pakistan, including Islamabad. The Rangers have notably contributed towards maintaining law and order in Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore in major crises. The Sindh Rangers consist of approximately 25,000 persons whereas almost half of the total force is deployed to Karachi. Due to the unstable situation in Pakistan, the Rangers have become extremely necessary to maintain law and order in all major cities. Rangers Anti Terrorist Force. The Rangers Anti-Terrorist Company has been active since early 2004. They were trained by Zarrar Company of Special Services Group (SSG)of Pakistani Army. This company also participated in a recent exercise with U.K. Special Air Service operators and U.S. Army Rangers stationed in Karachi. Training and selection. The selection for rangers lasts 2–3 weeks. Both male and females can join the Rangers and an applicant must be between 18–25 years old for PUNJAB RANGERS and 18 to 30 years old for SINDH RANGERS . In order to apply for the Rangers, the applicant must passed F.A or F.Sc. (an equivalent to U.S. metriculation system) from a government-registered college. An applicant may hold a Kashmiri or Pakistani citizenship to join the Force. The Rangers can be deployed at any place either in Pakistan or abroad, according to the Rangers Act of 1959. In spite of its role as paramilitary, the Rangers have been recognized by Government of Pakistan as one of its special forces. Appointments. Although the Pakistan Rangers are under the administration of the Interior ministry, key positions in the force, including Director-General of the Rangers, are headed by the members Pakistan Army. The Director Geeral of the Pakistan Rangers is appointed by Pakistan Army's Generals Headquarters (GHQ). The majority of the officers are departmental officers who get promotion from the rank of Sub Inspector.  The rank structure of OR's, NCO's, JCO'S of the force is:- OR equal to OR Lance Naik equal to Lance Naik Naik equal to Naik Havaldar equal to Havaldar Sub Inspector, Inspector and Senior Ranger Inspector(SRI) who get promoted from OR Ranks are Equal to Sub Inspector equal to Naib Subedar Inspector equal to Subedar SRI equal to Subedar Major Officer Ranks Structure:- Direct Entry Sub Inspector and Inspector act as Army Second Lieutenant, and Lieutenant Sub Inspector act as Second Lieutenant Inspector act as Lieutenant DSR(Deputy Superintendent of Rangers) equal to Army Captain SR(Superintendent of Rangers) equal to Army Major SSR(Senior Superintendent of Rangers) equal to Lieutenant Colonel The ranks insignia are same as Pakistan Army except Sub Inspector and Inspector and then other Senior Ranks officers comes from Pakistan Army . Each Company is commanded by a DSR (Deputy Superintendent Rangers). The Rangers also maintain a commando unit known as the ""red commandos."" Flag lowering ceremony. Wagah, the only road border crossing between Pakistan and India, has been the site of a flag lowering ceremony each evening. During the ceremony, Pakistani Rangers and their counterparts in the Indian Border Security Force carry out a drill in which they mirror each other's drill with foot stamping and aggressive stares. Despite the outward display of aggression, the drill of both sides actually requires a high degree of co-operation. This drill is having a unique importance that it is the only drill of such a style in the whole world and many tourists attend this to feel that enthusiasim which is unique in its own nature. Standard equipment. The formal headwear of the Rangers are somewhat similar to the ones worn by the Frontier Corps. Notable officers. In the past there was direct entry through which the cadets were selected for the rank of sub inspector but recently this procedure is closed . The senior most entry is the 3rd and 4th entry and many of them are now serving at the rank of SR or SSR. Karachi Incident. This was a controversial incident regarding the shooting of a 22-year-old Pakistani citizen Sarfaraz Shah by soldiers affiliated with Sindh Rangers, a branch of the paramilitary command Pakistan Rangers.The Rangers personnel were criminally tried and sentenced. The electronic media played a vital role in highlighting this event. Role in peace maintenance in Karachi. While kidnapping for ransom, extortion, threats to business community was common in Karachi and industrialists were shifting their investment in Bangladesh and other countries, Chief Of Army Staff, Gen Ashfaq Pervaiz Kiyani too the notice of dire situation and on request of government and business community, Pakistan Rangers was deployed with special powers. Pak Rangers played excellent role in maintaining peace and curbed law offenders without any discrimination and consideration of political affiliation. Business community in particular and masses in general took sight of relief and lauded the role of rangers in Sindh. Diretor General Rangers Sindh Lt.General Ejaz Chaudry visited Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 17 November 2011, on this occasion business community unanimously acclaimed the rangers role in maintaining peace in the city and demanded extension in its stay with special orders for another one year.

wikipedia-241023," Common Chaffinch  The Common Chaffinch (""Fringilla coelebs""), usually known simply as the Chaffinch is a common and widespread small passerine bird in the finch family. The male is brightly coloured with a blue-grey cap and rust-red underparts. The female is much duller in colouring but both sexes have two contrasting white wings-bars and white sides to the tail. The male bird has a strong voice and sings from exposed perches to attract a mate. The Chaffinch breeds in much of Europe, across Asia to Siberia and in northwest Africa. It prefers open woodland and often forages on the ground. The female builds a nest with a deep cup in the fork of a tree. The clutch is typically 4–5 eggs, which hatch in about 13 days. The chicks fledge in around 14 days but are fed by both adults for several weeks after leaving the nest. The Chaffinch is a partial migrant; birds breeding in warmer regions are sedentary while those breeding in the colder northern areas of its range winter further south.  Taxonomy. The Chaffinch was described by Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his ""Systema Naturae"" under its current binomial name. ""Fringilla"" is the Latin word for a finch while ""coelebs"" means unmarried or single. Linnaeus remarked that during the Swedish winter, only the female birds migrated south through Belgium to Italy. The English name comes from the Old English ""ceaffinc"", where ""ceaf"" is ""chaff"" and ""finc"" ""finch"". The finch family, Fringillidae, is divided into two subfamilies, the Carduelinae, containing around 28 genera with 141 species and the Fringillinae containing a single genus, ""Fringilla"", with 3 species: the Chaffinch, (""Fringilla coelebs""), the Blue Chaffinch, (""Fringilla teydea""), and the Brambling (""Fringilla montifringilla""). The finch family are all seed-eaters with stout conical bills. They have similar skull morphologies, nine large primaries, twelve tail feathers and no crop. In all species the female bird builds the nest, incubates the eggs and broods the young. Fringilline finches raise their young almost entirely on anthropods while the cardueline finches raise their young on regurgitated seeds. Subspecies. A number of subspecies of the Chaffinch have been described based principally on the differences in the pattern and colour of the adult male plumage. The list of subspecies can be divided into three groups: the """"coelebs"" group"" that occurs in Europe and Asia, the """"spondiogenys"" group"" in North Africa and the """"canariensis"" group"" on the Canary Islands. The subspecies from Madeira and the Azores are placed either in the """"canariensis"" group"" or in the """"spondiogenys"" group"". Genetic studies indicate that members of the """"coelebs"" group"" and the """"spondiogenys"" group"" are more closely related to each other than they are to members of the """"canariensis"" group"". Within the """"spondiogenys"" group"" the gradual clinal variation over the large geographic range and the extensive intergradation means that the geographical limits and acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities. The International Ornithologists' Union lists eleven subspecies from this group, whereas Collar ""et al."" (2010) in the Handbook of Birds of the World list seven and consider the features of the subspecies ""balearica"" (Mallorca), ""caucasica"" (southern Caucasus), ""schiebeli"" (southern Greece, Crete and western Turkey) and ""tyrrhenica"" (Corsica) to fall within the variation of the nominate subspecies. They also suggest that the subspecies ""alexandrovi"", ""sarda"", ""solomkoi"" and ""syriaca"" may represent variations of the nominate subspecies. Suárez ""et al."" (2009) used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers in a study of the three subspecies of ""Fringilla coelebs"" that are currently recognised on the Canary Islands. The authors concluded that the Common Chaffinches on the islands are sufficiently distinct in both genotype and phenotype to be considered as a separate species within the ""Fringilla"" genus. They also proposed a revised distribution of subspecies on the islands in which the birds on La Palma (""palmae"") and El Hierro (""ombrioso"") are grouped together as a single subspecies while the current ""canariensis"" subspecies is split into two with one subspecies occurring only on Gran Canaria and the other on La Gomera and Tenerife. Description. The Chaffinch is about long, with a wingspan of and a weight of . The adult male of the nominate subspecies has a black forehead and a blue-grey crown, nape and upper mantle. The rump is a light olive-green; the lower mantle and scapulars form a brown saddle. The side of head, throat and breast are a dull rust-red merging to a pale creamy-pink on the belly. The central pair of tail feathers are dark grey with a black shaft streak. The rest of the tail is black apart from the two outer feathers on each side which have white wedges. Each wing has a contrasting white panel on the coverts and a buff-white bar on the secondaries and inner primaries. The flight feathers are black with white on the basal portions of the vanes. The secondaries and inner primaries have pale yellow fringes on the outer web whereas the outer primaries have a white outer edge. After the autumn moult the tips of the new feathers have a buff fringe that adds a brown cast to the coloured plumage. The ends of the feathers wear away over the winter so that by the spring breeding season the underlying brighter colours are displayed. The eyes have dark brown irises and the legs are grey-brown. In winter the bill is a pale grey and slightly darker along the upper ridge or culmen, but in spring the bill becomes bluish-grey with a small black tip. The adult female is much duller in appearance than the male. The head and most of upperparts are shades of grey-brown. The underparts are paler. The lower back and rump are a dull olive green. The wings and tail are similar to those of the male. The juvenile resembles the female. Voice. The powerful song is very well known, and its ""fink"" or ""vink"" sounding call gives the finch family its English name. Males typically sing two or three different song types, and there are regional dialects too. The acquisition by the young chaffinch of its song was the subject of an influential study by British ethologist William Thorpe. Thorpe determined that if the chaffinch is not exposed to the adult male's song during a certain critical period after hatching, it will never properly learn the song. He also found that in adult chaffinches, castration eliminates song, but injection of testosterone induces such birds to sing even in November, when they are normally silent. Distribution and habitat. The Chaffinch breeds in wooded areas where the July isotherm is between . The breeding range includes northwest Africa, most of Europe and extends eastwards across temperate Asia to the Angara River and the southern end of Lake Baikal in Siberia. There are also a number of distinctive subspecies on the Azores, the Canary Islands and the Madeira Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The Chaffinch was introduced from Britain into several of its overseas territories in the 19th century. In New Zealand the Chaffinch has colonised both the North and South Islands and is now one of the most common passerine species. In South Africa a very small breeding colony in the suburbs of Constantia, Hout Bay and Camps Bay near Cape Town is the only remnant of another such introduction. Behaviour. This bird is not migratory in the milder parts of its range, but vacates the colder regions in winter. This species forms loose flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with Bramblings. This bird occasionally strays to eastern North America, although some sightings may be escapees. The main food of the Chaffinch is seeds, but unlike most finches, the young are fed extensively on insects, and adults also eat insects in the breeding season. Breeding. Chaffinches first breed when they are one year old. They are mainly monogamous and the pair-bond for residential subspecies such as ""gengleri"" sometimes persists from one year to the next. The date for breeding is dependent on the spring temperature and is earlier in southwest Europe and later in the northeast. In Britain most clutches are laid between late April and the middle of June. A male attracts a female to his territory through song.  Nests are built entirely by the female and are usually located in the fork of a bush or a tree several meters above the ground. The nest has a deep cup and is lined with a layer of thin roots and feathers. The outside is covered with a layer of lichen and spider silk over an inner layer of moss and grass. The eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals until the clutch is complete. The clutch is typically 4-5 eggs which are smooth and slightly glossy but very variable in colour. They range from pale-blueish green to light red with purple brown blotches, spots or steaks. The average size of an egg is with a weight of . The eggs are incubated for 10-16 days by the female. The chicks are altricial, hatching nearly naked with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents but mainly by the female who broods them for around six days. They are mainly fed caterpillars. The nestlings fledge 11-18 days after hatching and disperse. The young birds are then assisted with feeding by both parents for a further three weeks. The parents only very rarely start a second brood, but when they do so it is always in a new nest. In a study carried out in Britain using ring-recovery data, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year was 53 per cent, and the adult annual survival rate was 59 per cent. From these figures the typical lifespan is only three years, but the maximum age recorded is 15 years and 6 months for a bird in Switzerland. Predators and parasites. The eggs and nestlings of the Chaffinch are predated by crows, red and grey squirrels, domestic cats and probably also by stoats and weasels. Clutches began later in the spring suffer less predation, an effect that is believed to be due to the increased vegetation making nests more difficult to find. The protozoal parasite ""Trichomonas gallinae"" was known to infect pigeons and raptors but beginning in Britain in 2005, carcases of dead European Greenfinches and Chaffinches were found to be infected with the parasite. The disease spread and in 2008 infected carcases were found in Norway, Sweden and Finland and a year later in Germany. The spread of the disease is believed to have been mediated by Chaffinches as large numbers of the birds breed in northern Europe and winter in Britain. In Britain the number of infected carcases recovered each year declined after a peak in 2006. There was a reduction in the number of Greenfinches but no significant decline in the overall number of Chaffinches. A similar pattern occurred in Finland where, after the arrival of the disease in 2008, there was a reduction in the number of Greenfinches but only a small change in the number of Chaffinches. Chaffinches can develop tumors on their feet and legs caused by the ""Fringilla coelebs"" papillomavirus. The size of the papillomas range from a small nodule on a digit to a large growth involving both the foot and the leg. The disease is uncommon: in a 1973 study undertaken in the Netherlands, of around 25,000 chaffinches screened only 330 bore papillomas. Status. The Chaffinch has an extensive range, estimated at 7 million square kilometres (3.7 million square miles) and a large population including an estimated 130–240 million breeding pairs in Europe. Allowing for the birds breeding in Asia, the total population lies between 530–1,400 million individuals. There is no evidence of any serious overall decline in numbers, so the species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The endemic subspecies on the Macaronesian islands in the Atlantic are vulnerable to the loss of habitat, especially ""F. c. ombriosa"" on El Hierro in the Canary Islands where the breeding population is between 1000-5000 pairs. Relationship to humans. The Chaffinch is a popular pet bird in some European countries. In Belgium, the ancient traditional sport of vinkenzetting pits male chaffinches against one another in a contest for the most bird calls in an hour. William Turner described the Chaffinch in his book on birds published in 1544. The book is in Latin but he gives two English folk names: ""sheld-appel"" and ""spink"".  The word ""sheld"" is a dialectal word meaning pied or multicoloured (as in Shelduck). Appel may be related to ""Alp"", an obsolete word for a Bullfinch. The name ""spink"" is probably derived from the bird's call note. The names ""spink"" and ""shell apple"" are among the many folk names listed for the Chaffinch by Reverend Charles Swainson in his ""Provincial Names and Folk Lore of British Birds"" (1885). The Chaffinch is depicted in a marginal decoration of the 15th century English illuminated manuscript the Sherborne Missal. "
wikipedia-1257905," Solar Winds  Solar Winds: The Escape and its sequel Solar Winds: Galaxy also known as Solar Winds II: Universe are top-down, space-based action games developed by James Schmalz and published by Epic MegaGames in . The main character of both games, bounty hunter Jake Stone, takes on a series of missions that has him fighting robots, aliens, and rebels in ship-to-ship combat. The story is told through simple conversations and brief cutscenes. In some ways, the series is reminiscent of the much larger and more complex Star Control II, without the ship customization and fleet building aspects. Plot. In ""The Escape"", humans live in a solar system millions of light years from our own. Space travel is common within the solar system, but hyperdrive research is restricted; any research pertaining to hyperdrive travel is destroyed by the oppressive solar government's army of robots. However, one group has spent a decade in secret developing a hyperdrive ship and plans to use it to escape the force field encasing their solar system. The government hires Stone to stop them. It is eventually revealed that the solar government is conspiring with a race of ""overlord"" aliens to stop the development of hyperdrive technology. These overlords keep various species for study, and actively push these species toward war for reasons unknown. Travel to other solar systems is barred by enormous, invisible force fields erected around the systems. The overlord aliens and their agents travel by means of fixed, self-made portals, or wormholes, opened with special keys. Ultimately, Stone is able to travel through one of the portals where he is greeted by a group of agitators from the overlords. They want him to help them stop the cruel treatment of these species. In ""Universe"", Jake Stone must continue his work with these agitators to disrupt the portals. Meanwhile, a human colony fleet from Earth is heading for the force field surrounding Earth's solar system. Ultimately Stone is able to work for the enemy in order to get close enough to destroy the Controller that maintains the portals leading to the various worlds, thus freeing these worlds--including Earth. Gameplay. The game is essentially linear, with very little room for innovation or exploration. The focus is always on Stone's ship. There are a number of weapons: a photon cannon that can fire rapid shots of 1, 2, or 3 bursts (the more bursts, the slower), and several types of missiles that can track enemy ships (or Stone's own ship if it's in the way). Combat is simple: spin and evade enemy fire while firing in return. The ""frequency"" of the shields and photons can be changed. If one frequency is chosen and fired, a shielding system that matches said frequency will take a greater level of damage. As the game progresses, different frequencies for weapons and shields become available. After equipping the E-Band converter device, power can be acquired by destroying enemy ships. Energy crystals or a green fluid held in a beaker can also increase power. The more power put into a shield, weapon, or drive system, the more powerful or faster it will be. Power is consumed by the hyperdrive when in use, or the shields when hit by enemy fire. Hull integrity is shown through a square superimposed on top of the ship. At full health, the square will be bright green. When the ship is damaged, this square will fade to black. As time goes on, the ship will repair itself, the speed of which depending on how much power has been dedicated to the life support systems. There are four different zoom modes in the game. The first, 1X, shows a detailed look at the area immediately surrounding the ship. The second mode, 10X, can show an entire solar system. Increasing the scan power level enables planets, moons, asteroid belts, and even enemies to be shown on the screen. The third mode, 100X, shows the star cluster. The final mode is the ""war mode"", wider than 1X and used for combat. There are limited dialogue options with characters in the game, but with few exceptions, all conversations must proceed in the same direction, regardless of what is said. Criticisms. There are a number of bugs in the game, including graphical errors that prevent the player from damaging certain enemy ships when in the right spot on the screen, and a bug that allows enemy vessels to damage the hull without damaging the shields. Another bug allowed the player's ship to move impossibly fast by rapidly increasing power while in hyperdrive. As power runs out, the speed does not slow. "
wikipedia-453041," Orthogonal functions  In mathematics, two functions formula_1 and formula_2 are called orthogonal if their inner product formula_3 is zero for ""f"" ≠ ""g"". How the inner product of two functions is defined may vary depending on context. However, a typical definition of an inner product for functions is with appropriate integration boundaries. Here, the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate of f. For another perspective on this inner product, suppose approximating vectors formula_5 and formula_6 are created whose entries are the values of the functions ""f"" and ""g"", sampled at equally spaced points. Then this inner product between ""f"" and ""g"" can be roughly understood as the dot product between approximating vectors formula_5 and formula_6, in the limit as the number of sampling points goes to infinity. Thus, roughly, two functions are orthogonal if their approximating vectors are perpendicular (under this common inner product).[http://maze5.net/?page_id=369] Solutions of linear differential equations with boundary conditions can often be written as a weighted sum of orthogonal solution functions (a.k.a. eigenfunctions). Examples of sets of orthogonal functions: Generalization of vectors. It can be shown that orthogonality of functions is a generalization of the concept of orthogonality of vectors. Suppose we define V to be the set of variables on which the functions ""f"" and ""g"" operate. (In the example above, V={x} since x is the only parameter to ""f"" and ""g"". Since there is one parameter, one integral sign is required to determine orthogonality. If V contained two variables, it would be necessary to integrate twice—over a range of each variable—to establish orthogonality.) If V is an empty set, then ""f"" and ""g"" are just constant vectors, and there are no variables over which to integrate. Thus, the equation reduces to a simple inner-product of the two vectors. "
wikipedia-147692," Tim Alexander  Timothy W. ""Tim"" Alexander (born April 10, 1965 in Cherry Point, North Carolina) is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock band Primus. Tim played on the Primus recordings ""Suck on This"" to ""Tales from the Punchbowl"", before leaving the band in 1996, only to rejoin in 2003 for the EP ""Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People"". He was a member of, and toured with, Primus from early 2003 until approximately 2009 when he was replaced by Jay Lane. Although Alexander has been quoted saying he was originally inspired to become a rock drummer by legendary drummers like John Bonham, Neil Peart and Shaun O'Connor, Primus guitarist Larry LaLonde claims Alexander's drum beats are mostly influenced by African Jùjú music.  Prior to joining Primus, he played and recorded with Major Lingo, which at the time was a ska-based rhythm band that featured a lap steel guitar as the lead instrument, played by Tony Bruno. When Major Lingo toured through the Bay Area Tim met members of Primus and would go on to remain there trying out for the band.  Following Alexander's departure from Primus, he went on to form his own group, Laundry. Alexander released two albums with the band Laundry; ""Blacktongue"" and ""Motivator"". Alexander has also collaborated with experimental bass player Michael Manring and guitarist Alex Skolnick to form the group known as Attention Deficit.  Alexander was the first drummer of A Perfect Circle, performing early live shows with the band, and recording drums for the track ""The Hollow"" on the band's debut album, ""Mer de Noms"".  Alexander joined the theatrical group Blue Man Group, and has occasionally played with the Las Vegas-based improvisational rock band Uberschall. Despite being primarily known for his drum work Alexander is an accomplished guitarist and singer. He performed live guitar with the group Born Naked and held the lead vocal duties on Laundry's second album and supporting tour.  Alexander was involved throughout 2008-09 in a project known as Into The Presence which features songs by Luis Carlos Maldonado. Their debut album was released on Razor and Tie Records and includes performances from bassist Paz Lenchantin and cellist Ana Lenchantin. Both Into The Presence and the Fata Morgana release were recorded and produced at Alexander's own Ghost Town Studios. As of 2010 Alexander is actively involved as a member of Maynard James Keenan's Puscifer project. He has toured with them and can be heard on their most recent released recordings. In 2013, it was announced that Alexander would be rejoining Primus, as previous drummer Jay Lane would be moving on to other projects. Equipment.

wikipedia-682602," Riding boot  A riding boot is a boot made to be used for horse riding. The classic boot comes high enough up the leg to prevent the leathers of the saddle from pinching the leg of the rider, has a sturdy toe to protect the rider's foot when on the ground and has a distinct heel to prevent the foot from sliding through the stirrup. The sole is smooth or lightly textured to avoid being caught on the tread of the stirrup in the event of a fall. The modern riding boot is relatively low-heeled, with a heel of less than one inch, though historically a higher heel was common, as it has always been critically important for riding boots to prevent the foot from slipping through the stirrup. Today, only some styles of cowboy boot retain a higher heel than other modern riding boots. English riding designs. For the riding disciplines that fall into the category of English riding, there are a number of different styles of riding boots, intended for different styles of riding, from horse shows, to pleasure riding. Tall boots, which end just below the knee of the rider, include field, dress, and hunt boots. These are standard show apparel, worn by all competitors in the hunter/jumper and dressage disciplines. A lower, paddock boot that stops just above the ankle, is worn by children, by some show competitors in the UK, Australia, and by those that show Saddle seat... Field boots: so called because they were traditionally worn by officers ranked ""field grade"" or higher, have lacing at the vamp, which allows for some give so the rider is more comfortable riding with the highly flexed ankle that develops from the shorter stirrup length required for work over fences. Therefore, field boots are preferred in all jumping disciplines, including Hunt seat equitation, show jumping, fox hunting, and both jumping phases in eventing. They are also worn by police officers riding motorcycles or on mounted patrols, and by some police agencies as part of their ""Class A"" uniform or with ceremonial mounted units. The majority of field boots are black, although brown-colored boots may also be purchased. Dress boots: do not have lacing at the ankle, and are generally stiffer. They are worn by dressage riders, eventers in the dressage phase, and at formal fox hunts. They are also worn by riders of show jumpers. Dress boots are traditionally black in color. A recent fad is dress boots for dressage that are cut to go extra high on the outside of the knee. Hunt boots, or Top boots: like the dress boot, except it has a ""cuff"" at the top. The boot is usually black, with a tan cuff (traditional for male riders). It is appropriate for fox hunting. Paddock boots, also known as Jodhpur boots, are short boots that come just above the ankle, used most often for pleasure riding and everyday use. They are also required for Saddle seat style riding and are frequently worn by children when showing in hunt seat disciplines because they are less costly for rapidly-growing children than are tall boots. They are sometimes combined with half chaps, a type of gaiter also known as chapettes, for added protection or to give the visual impression of a tall boot. The lace-up style is primarily seen in hunt seat riding, whereas the elastic-sided Chelsea boot design is seen in both hunt seat and saddle seat disciplines. The elastic side boot is also commonly used in Australia as a riding boot and dress boot. They are part of the required attire in Australian Stock Horse turnout competitions and for Pony Club riding. Heavier versions, such as Blundstone boots, are made for general work and gardening but are not suitable for riding owing to their heavy, deep-grooved soles. Field boots (and many paddock boots) have an extra layer of leather on the toe, called a toe cap. All styles have somewhat tapered, round toes. Current styles include zip-on boots, with a zipper running down the back of the calf of a tall boot or the front of a paddock boot, making them easier to put on and remove without aid of boot hooks or a boot jack. Brown tall boots (field or dress) were somewhat more common before World War II, when the English riding habit lost popularity outside of formal and/or horse show events. The U.S. Army, whose officers had worn high brown boots in World War I, abandoned the practice by the late 1930s. For a time, some show sanctioning organizations did not allow brown boots, considering them to be casual attire, although the rule has relaxed somewhat. Cowboy boots. For western riding and showing, western riders wear cowboy boots, with either the high ""cowboy"" or ""riding"" heel; the intermediate, somewhat lower ""walking"" heel; or the low, ""roper"" style heel that is similar to that of English boots. The uppers may vary in height. The lowest is the ""roper"" style that stops just a bit above the ankle, about an inch or so higher than the English paddock boot. The most classic length is the mid-calf height that keeps the fenders of a western saddle from chafing the ankle and calf of the rider. The tallest cowboy boots are seldom seen outside of fashion venues, but have an upper that reaches nearly to the knee, are usually extensively decorated, but in the modern day are seldom used for actual horse riding. For pleasure riding, lace-up or zip-up boots similar to English paddock boots, have become popular in recent years, though the classic pull-on boot still is common. Cowboy boots are traditionally made of smooth cowhide, though occasionally a boot style may be of a suede or ""roughout"" look. However, the uppers of more expensive designs may be made of leather obtained from somewhat exotic creatures, including alligator, ostrich and snakeskin. Materials. Traditionally, English riding boots are made of smooth leather, usually cowhide, or occasionally pigskin, and most show boots remain thus due to the classic look. However, synthetic leather, vinyl and other materials are becoming more common. Quality of leather varies, with softer, finer-quality increasing the value of the boot. For formal wear, patent leather is occasionally seen, particularly in jodhpur boots designed for Saddle seat horse show classes held after 6:00 pm, when formal attire may be worn in certain types of competition. For casual riding, riders often wear well-worn show boots, but also may take advantage of new boot designs modeled after the athletic shoe or hiking boot that have been created, using space age synthetics and breathable materials to create what essentially is a ""tennis shoe with a heel."" Steel toed boots are not intended for riding, as a horse can pinch the steel down onto the rider's toes. "
wikipedia-8061660," Lipocalin  The lipocalins are a family of proteins which transport small hydrophobic molecules such as steroids, bilins, retinoids, and lipids. They share limited regions of sequence homology and a common tertiary structure architecture. This is an eight stranded antiparallel beta-barrel with a repeated + 1 topology enclosing an internal ligand binding site. These proteins are found in gram negative bacteria, vertebrate cells, and invertebrate cells, and in plants. Lipocalins have been associated with many biological processes, among them immune response, pheromone transport, biological prostaglandin synthesis, retinoid binding, and cancer cell interactions.  Function. Immune response. Lipocalin proteins are involved in inflammation and detoxification processes caused by immune system activation in mammals. They are known respiratory allergens of mice, cats, dogs, horses, and other animals. Examples of lipocalin proteins involved in immune system responses include alpha-1-microglobulin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and c8gamma. Structural information for many immune system influencing lipocalin proteins is available, while their exact role in biological systems is still somewhat unclear. Human allergenic reactions to lipocalins have not been extensively investigated.  Pheromone transport. The lipocalin family has been connected with the transport of mammalian pheromones due to easily observable protein-pheromone interactions. Lipocalins are comparatively small in size, and are thus less complicated to study as opposed to large, bulky proteins. They can also bind to various ligands for different biological purposes. Lipocalins have been detected as carrier proteins of important pheromones in the nasal mucus of rodents. Major urinary proteins, a lipocalin subfamily, are found in mouse and rat urine and may act as protein pheromones themselves. Prostaglandin synthesis. This family of proteins plays a part in the biological system of terminal prostaglandin synthesis.  Retinoid binding. Retinol, (vitamin A), is an important micronutrient that affects eyesight, cell differentiation, immune system function, bone growth, and tumor suppression. Retinol absorption and metabolism depends on lipocalins that act as binding proteins. Retinyl esters (present in meats) and beta-carotene (present in plants) are the two main sources of retinoids in the diet. After intake, they are converted to retinol, successively metabolized, and finally bound to retinol binding proteins (lipocalins) in the blood plasma.  Cancer cell interactions. Because lipocalins are extracellular proteins, their intracellular effects are not obvious, and demand further study. However, lipophilic ligands, present as substituents to the lipocalins, have the ability to enter the cell, where they can act as tumor protease inhibitors. This research suggests another possible route of protein-tumor investigations.  Allergens. Some of the proteins in this family are allergens. Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans. This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an Arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation. The allergens in this family include allergens with the following designations: Bla g 4, Bos d 2, Bos d 5, Can f 1, Can f 2, Fel d 4, Equ c 1 and Equ c 2. Structure. Although lipocalins are a broad family of greatly varied proteins, their three-dimensional structure is a unifying characteristic. Lipocalins have an eight-stranded, antiparallel, symmetrical β-barrel fold, which is in essence a beta sheet which has been rolled into a cylindrical shape. Inside this barrel is located a ligand binding site, which plays an important role in the lipocalin classification as a transport protein. If lipocalins are genetically engineered in the attempt to modify their binding properties, they are called anticalins. Family members. The name ""lipocalin"" has been proposed for this protein family, but cytosolic fatty acid binding proteins are also included. The sequences of most members of the family, the core or kernel lipocalins, are characterised by three short conserved stretches of residues, while others, the outlier lipocalin group, share only one or two of these. Proteins known to belong to this family include alpha-1-microglobulin (protein HC); major urinary proteins; alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid); aphrodisin; apolipoprotein D; beta-lactoglobulin; complement component C8 gamma chain; crustacyanin; epididymal-retinoic acid binding protein (E-RABP); insectacyanin; odorant binding protein (OBP); human pregnancy-associated endometrial alpha-2 globulin (PAEP); probasin (PB), a prostatic protein; prostaglandin D synthase; purpurin; Von Ebner's gland protein (VEGP); and lizard epididymal secretory protein IV (LESP IV). Human proteins that contain lipocalin domain include: "

wikipedia-19377844," Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company  Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company (1876–77) L.R. 2 App. Cas. 666 is an English contract law case, which established that a contract can be accepted by the conduct of the parties. Facts. Mr Brogden, the chief of a partnership of three, had supplied the Metropolitan Railway Company with coals for a number of years. Brogden then suggested that a formal contract should be entered into between them for longer term coal supply. Each side's agents met together and negotiated. Metropolitan's agents drew up some terms of agreement and sent them to Brogden. Brogden wrote in some parts which had been left blank and inserted an arbitrator who would decide upon differences which might arise. He wrote ""approved"" at the end and sent back the agreement documents. Metropolitan's agent filed the documents and did nothing more. For a while, both acted according to the agreement document's terms. But then some more serious disagreements arose, and Brogden argued that there had been no formal contract actually established. Judgment. The House of Lords (The Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, Lord Hatherley, Lord Selborne, Lord Blackburn, and Lord Gordon) held that a contract had arisen by conduct and Brogden had been in clear breach, so he must be liable. The word ""approved"" on the document with Brogden's name was binding on all the partners, since Brogden was the chief partner, even though the standard signature of “B. & Sons” was not used. A mere mental assent to the agreement's terms would not have been enough, but having acted on the terms made it so. Lord Blackburn also held that the onus of showing that both parties had acted on the terms of an agreement which had not been, in due form, executed by either, lies upon person alleging such facts. A key extract from Lord Blackburn's judgment Blackburn was one of the most distinguished judges of his time: ""I have always believed the law to be this, that when an offer is made to another party, and in that offer there is a request express or implied that he must signify his acceptance by doing some particular thing, then as soon as he does that thing, he is bound. If a man sent an offer abroad saying: I wish to know whether you will supply me with goods at such and such a price, and, if you agree to that, you must ship the first cargo as soon as you get this letter, there can be no doubt that as soon as the cargo was shipped the contract would be complete, and if the cargo went to the bottom of the sea, it would go to the bottom of the sea at the risk of the orderer. So again, where, as in the case of"" Ex parte Harris"", a person writes a letter and says, I offer to take an allotment of shares, and he expressly or impliedly says, If you agree with me send an answer by the post, there, as soon as he has sent that answer by the post, and put it out of his control, and done an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shews beyond all doubt that each side is bound, I agree the contract is perfectly plain and clear.""  ""But when you come to the general proposition which Mr. Justice Brett seems to have laid down, that a simple acceptance in your own mind, without any intimation to the other party, and expressed by a mere private act, such as putting a letter into a drawer, completes a contract, I must say I differ from that. It appears from the Year Books that as long ago as the time of Edward IV, Chief Justice Brian decided this very point. The plea of the Defendant in that case justified the seizing of some growing crops because he said the Plaintiff had offered him to go and look at them, and if he liked them, and would give 2s. 6d. for them, he might take them; that was the justification. That case is referred to in a book which I published a good many years ago, ""Blackburn on Contracts of Sale"", and is there translated. Brian gives a very elaborate judgment, explaining the law of the unpaid vendor's lien, as early as that time, exactly as the law now stands, and he consequently says: “This plea is clearly bad, as you have not shewn the payment or the tender of the money;” but he goes farther, and says (I am quoting from memory, but I think I am quoting correctly), moreover, your plea is utterly naught, for it does not shew that when you had made up your mind to take them you signified it to the Plaintiff, and your having it in your own mind is nothing, for it is trite law that the thought of man is not triable, for even the devil does not know what the thought of man is; but I grant you this, that if in his offer to you he had said, Go and look at them, and if you are pleased with them signify it to such and such a man, and if you had signified it to such and such a man, your plea would have been good, because that was a matter of fact."" ""I take it, my Lords, that that, which was said 300 years ago and more, is the law to this day, and it is quite what Lord Justice Mellish in ""Ex parte Harris"" accurately says, that where it is expressly or impliedly stated in the offer that you may accept the offer by posting a letter, the moment you post the letter the offer is accepted. You are bound from the moment you post the letter, not, as it is put here, from the moment you make up your mind on the subject."" ""But my Lords, while, as I say, this is so upon the question of law, it is still necessary to consider this case farther upon the question of fact. I agree, and I think every Judge who has considered the case does agree, certainly Lord Chief Justice Cockburn does, that though the parties may have gone no farther than an offer on the one side, saying, Here is the draft,—(for that I think is really what this case comes to,)—and the draft so offered by the one side is approved by the other, everything being agreed to except the name of the arbitrator, which the one side has filled in and the other has not yet assented to, if both parties have acted upon that draft and treated it as binding, they will be bound by it. When they had come so near as I have said, still it remained to execute formal agreements, and the parties evidently contemplated that they were to exchange agreements, so that each side should be perfectly safe and secure, knowing that the other side was bound. But, although that was what each party contemplated, still I agree (I think the Lord Chief Justice Cockburn states it clearly enough), that if a draft having been prepared and agreed upon as the basis of a deed or contract to be executed between two parties, the parties, without waiting for the execution of the more formal instrument, proceed to act upon the draft, and treat it as binding upon them, both parties will be bound by it. But it must be clear that the parties have both waived the execution of the formal instrument and have agreed expressly, or as shewn by their conduct, to act on the informal one. I think that is quite right, and I agree with the way in which Mr. Herschell in his argument stated it, very truly and fairly. If the parties have by their conduct said, that they act upon the draft which has been approved of by Mr. Brogden, and which if not quite approved of by the railway company, has been exceedingly near it, if they indicate by their conduct that they accept it, the contract is binding.""

wikipedia-1595682," Loveland Pass  Loveland Pass is a high mountain pass in the western United States, at an elevation of above sea level in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado. Background. It is located on the Continental Divide in the Front Range west of Denver on U.S. Route 6. The twisty road is considered to be especially treacherous during the winter months. A steep, steady 6.7% grade, along with numerous hairpin turns on either side, make it difficult to snowplow the road regularly.  Loveland is the highest mountain pass in the world that regularly stays open during a snowy winter season. When the Eisenhower Tunnel opened in March 1973, it allowed motorists on Interstate 70 to avoid crossing the pass directly. Trucks that cannot pass through the tunnel (those carrying hazardous materials and those over in height) must still take US 6 across Loveland Pass, 800 vertical feet (244 m) above the tunnel. The same is true for bicyclists, pedestrians, and those drivers who wish to stop along the road to admire the scenery. Loveland Ski Area is located at the eastern end of the pass, and Arapahoe Basin is on the west side. The pass itself is a popular destination for backcountry skiers. Occasionally during the winter, the pass road may be closed by a blizzard and all traffic must use the tunnel, even the normally forbidden HAZMAT-carrying vehicles. In the event of less serious winter storms, chain restrictions are often imposed. At the Loveland Pass parking lot, visitors can access trails to the summits of Mount Sniktau and other nearby mountain peaks. The pass is named for William A.H. Loveland, a resident of Golden during the late 19th century who was president of the Colorado Central Railroad. The town of Loveland, which is not located near Loveland Pass, is also named after him. Avalanche. On April 20, 2013, an avalanche in Loveland Pass Colorado killed five snowboarders in the deadliest avalanche in Colorado since 1962. A sixth snowboarder involved in the incident survived, extracted himself, and flagged down a truck from the state's Transportation Department. "
wikipedia-3535282," UAAP Cheerdance Competition  The UAAP Cheerdance Competition is an annual one-day event of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines for cheerleading. However, it does not count in the tabulation to determine the UAAP Overall Championship. The sequence of the performance are determined by drawing of lots prior the competition. Since 2006, side-court reporters of each participating universities join the main host of the event. Before the announcement of winners and after all squads have performed, a recap is shown during the telecast. Only the Top 3 are announced at the end of the competition. Both University of Santo Tomas and University of the Philippines are tied for the most number of championships (8). National University is the current defending champion. The 2008 Samsung UAAP Cheerdance Competition was the most attended UAAP event with a record-breaking 23,443 paying audience. Rules. The competition rules has been revised through the years since it began. The following is based on the most recent rules drafted in 2012. Judges. Prior 2009, the panel of judges compose of representative from 8 UAAP-member schools and a representative from a credible gymnastics organizations. In 2009, UAAP replaced the panel of judges with representatives from various cheerleading, dance, and gymnastics organizations. In 2013, a different way of composing the panel of judges was made. A single judge was assigned in every element in the cheerleading criteria. For the dance criteria, four judges were tasked to judge this particular criteria. Criteria. The criteria for judging varies year-on-year. In 2008, the criteria were changed to a more cheerleading-focused point-system giving a maximum score for each element of cheerleading and/or dancing. The 2010 edition of the competition introduced a new system to determine the final ranking of the squads. Although a point-system was in place to judge each squad's routine, the ranking prevails to determine the winners. For 2013 edition, the criteria was divided into two, cheerleading and dance criteria. Cheerleading criteria was sub-divided into three elements (tumbling, stunt and pyramid) with maximum of 100 points each element. While the Dance criteria, which had a maximum of 100 points per number of judges for dance, was sub-divided into four sub-criteria (over-all effectiveness, choreography, technique and execution). Results. Every season, the host school for the UAAP Cheerdance Competition (CDC) may or may not be different from the league's season host school.  Notes: Group Stunts Division. In 2011, UAAP introduced the Group Stunts Competition. However, only five member-schools competed where Adamson Pep Squad, DLSU Animo -Squad, and UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe did not participate. In 2012, six member-schools participated in the Group Stunts Competition. This includes AdU, NU, DLSU, FEU, UP, UST. UP–UST rivalry. Chronology of events. The UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe won the first three years of competition from 1994 to 1996. During those years, UP used to send its own dance troupe, the UP Filipiniana Dance Troupe. In the 1998 season, UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe did not compete and instead joined the ""1st Lipton Cheering Cup Competition"". Also in that year, UP established a new pep squad, called ""UP Varsity Pep Squad"", as its official delegate to the competition to replace the UP Filipiniana Dance Troupe.  The rivalry between the two squads began in 1999 when UST returned to reclaim the title after their year of absence. However, they only finished second behind UP Pep Squad. In 2001, UP Pep Squad matched the record of UST's three consecutive wins. In 2002, UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe regained the title while UP Pep Squad finished third. The next three years had UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe in first place and UP Pep Squad as runner-up. In 2006, UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe received their eighth title via five consecutive victories while UP Pep Squad finished third on that year. UP Pep Squad regained the title in 2007 and garnered their fifth title in 2008, setting the highest recorded lead over 2nd placer UST.  UP–FEU rivalry. Prior to 2009, it seemed that the championship trophy exclusively belonged to UP and UST. In 2009, FEU clinched the championship from UP where they only managed to place third. While UST fell outside the top 3, the first in their history. The following year, 2010, UP reclaimed the title while FEU and UST finished second and third respectively. For the 2011 edition, UP maintained its form and grabbed the top plum, while FEU only placed third behind DLSU's Animo Squad. Achieving its second three-peat in 2012, UP was ahead of FEU once again with Natioanal University Pep Squad taking its first top 3 finish. In 2013, UP was on a 4-peat campaign. However, it was the National University who emerged victorious, the only fourth school to bag the championship trophy in UAAP-CDC history. UP finished second and DLSU was able to bag another top 3 finish dislodging FEU out of the top 3. Popular cheers. UP's most popular cheer is """"U-ni-ber-si-dad ng Pi-li-pi-nas"""", which is chanted while the crowd clap their hands in the air. UST's cheer is """"Go USTe!"""", accompanied by the waving of either mustard-yellow hotdogs or right pointing fingers in circular counterclockwise or maybe clockwise motion. "
wikipedia-217961," Twinkie defense  ""Twinkie defense"" is a derisive label for an improbable legal defense. It is not a recognized legal defense in jurisprudence, but a catchall term coined by reporters during their coverage of the trial of defendant Dan White for the murders of San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk and mayor George Moscone. White's defense was that he suffered diminished capacity as a result of his depression. His change in diet from healthy food to Twinkies and other sugary food was said to be a symptom of depression. Contrary to common belief, White's attorneys did not argue that the Twinkies were the cause of White's actions, but that their consumption was symptomatic of his underlying depression. White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Origins. The expression derives from the 1979 trial of Dan White, a former San Francisco, California (U.S.) police officer and firefighter, and until just before the crime, a city district Supervisor. On November 27, 1978, White assassinated Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. At the trial, psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that White had been depressed at the time of the crime, and pointed to several behavioral changes indicating White's depression: he had quit his job; he shunned his wife; and although normally clean-cut, he had become slovenly in appearance. Furthermore, White had previously been a fitness fanatic and health food advocate, but had begun consuming junk food and sugar-laden soft drinks like Coca-Cola. As an incidental note, Blinder mentioned theories that elements of diet could worsen existing mood swings. Another psychiatrist, George Solomon, testified that White had ""exploded"" and was ""sort of on automatic pilot"" at the time of the killings. The fact that White had killed Moscone and Milk was not challenged, but – in part because of the testimony from Blinder and other psychiatrists – the defense successfully convinced the jury that White's capacity for rational thought had been diminished; the jurors found White incapable of the premeditation required for a murder conviction, and instead convicted him of voluntary manslaughter. Public protests over the verdict led to the White Night Riots. Diminished capacity. Twinkies were never mentioned in the courtroom during the White trial, nor did the defense ever claim that White was on a sugar rush and committed the murders as a result. However, one reporter's use of the term ""Twinkie defense"" caught on and stuck, leading to a persistent misunderstanding by the public. The misunderstanding was mentioned at the end of ""Milk"", Gus Van Sant's 2008 biopic of Harvey Milk. In a bonus feature on the DVD version of ""The Times of Harvey Milk"", a documentary on Milk's life and death, White's lawyers explain what they actually argued in court. The actual legal defense that White's lawyers used was that his mental capacity had been diminished, and White's consumption of junk food was presented to the jury as one of many ""symptoms"", not a ""cause"", of White's depression. In stories covering the trial, satirist Paul Krassner had played up the angle of the Twinkie, and he would later claim credit for coining the term ""Twinkie defense"". The day after the verdict, columnist Herb Caen wrote in the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" about the police support for White, himself a former policeman, and their ""dislike of homosexuals"" and mentioned ""the Twinkie insanity defense"" in passing. News stories published after the trial, however, frequently reported the defense arguments inaccurately, claiming that the defense had presented junk food as the cause of White's depression and/or diminished capacity, instead of having been symptomatic of an existing depression. Dan White committed suicide seven years later. As a result of negative publicity from the White case and others, the term ""diminished capacity"" was abolished in 1982 by Proposition 8 and the California legislature and was replaced by the term ""diminished actuality"", referring not to the capacity to have a specific intent, but to whether the defendant actually had the required intent to commit the crime with which he or she was charged. Additionally, California's statutory definitions of premeditation and malice required for murder were eliminated by the state's legislature, with the return to common law definitions. By this time, the ""Twinkie defense"" had become such a common term that one lawmaker had waved a Twinkie in the air while making his point during a debate. Supreme Court. During oral Supreme Court arguments in ""United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez"", 548 U.S. 140 (2006), Justice Antonin Scalia referred to the Twinkie defense with regard to the right to counsel of choice as perhaps more important than the right to effective assistance of counsel: ""I don't want a competent lawyer. I want a lawyer who's going to get me off. I want a lawyer who will invent the Twinkie defense. [ ] I would not consider the Twinkie defense an invention of a competent lawyer. But I want a lawyer who's going to win for me."" "
wikipedia-5383449," El Shaddai  El Shaddai (, ) is one of the Judaic names of God, with its etymology coming from the influence of the Ugaritic religion upon modern Judaism. Shaddai was one of the many Gods in Canaanite religion. ""El Shaddai"" is conventionally translated as God Almighty. While the translation of ""El"" as ""god"" in Ugarit/Canaanite language is straightforward, the literal meaning of ""Shaddai"" is the subject of debate. Shaddai as a theonym. According to Exodus 6:2, 3, Shaddai () is the name by which God was known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The name Shaddai is again used as a name of God later in the Book of Job. Shaddai meaning destroyer. The root word """"shadad"""" () means ""to overpower"" or ""to destroy"". This would give Shaddai the meaning of ""destroyer"", representing one of the aspects of God, and in this context it is essentially an epithet. The meaning of Shaddai may go back to the original sense of """"shadad"""" which was ""to be strong"" akin to Arabic """"shadiid"""" () ""strong"". The termination """"ai"""", typically signifying the first person possessive plural, functions as a pluralis excellentiae like other theonyms of the Hebrew God Elohim and Adonai. The possessive quality of the termination had lost its sense and become the lexical form of both Shaddai and Adonai, similar to how the French word Monsieur changed from meaning ""my lord"" to being an honorific title. Another theory is that Shaddai is a derivation of a Semitic stem that appears in the Akkadian shadû (""mountain"") and shaddā`û or shaddû`a (""mountain-dweller""), one of the names of Amurru. This theory was popularized by W. F. Albright but was somewhat weakened when it was noticed that the doubling of the medial d is first documented only in the Neo-Assyrian period. However, the doubling in Hebrew might possibly be secondary. According to this theory, God is seen as inhabiting a mythical holy mountain, a concept not unknown in ancient West Asian mythology (see El), and also evident in the Syriac Christian writings of Ephrem the Syrian, who places Eden on an inaccessible mountaintop. Shaddai meaning fertility. Harriet Lutzky, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Psychology at John Jay College, City University of New York, has presented evidence that Shaddai was an attribute of a Semitic goddess, linking the epithet Shaddai with the Hebrew ""šad"" meaning ""breast"", giving the meaning ""the one of the Breast"", as Asherah at Ugarit is ""the one of the Womb"". A similar theory proposed by Albright is that the name Shaddai is connected to ""shadayim"", the Hebrew word for ""breasts"". It may thus be connected to the notion of God's gifts of fertility to the human race. In several instances in the Torah the name is connected with fruitfulness: ""May God Almighty Shaddai bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers…"" (Gen. 28:3). ""I am God Almighty Shaddai: be fruitful and increase in number"" (Gen. 35:11). ""By the Almighty Shaddai who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb [racham"" (Gen. 49:25). Shaddai meaning sustainer and destroyer. As mentioned above there are two words in Hebrew that could be the origin of Shaddai: ""shada"" and ""shadad"" meaning to nurture and destroy respectively. They are derived from two Semetic root words, one meaning breast or fertility and the other meaning to lay waste, desolate, or bring to ruin. Shaddai can mean either ""my sustainers"" or ""my destroyers"" (possessive plural) in Hebrew when referring to humans and could mean both ""my ultimate sustainer and my ultimate destroyer"" in the majestic plural when referring to the God of Israel. In Hebrew a verb can be made into a singular possessive pronoun with the addition of the suffix ""i"" and it can be made into a plural possessive pronoun with the addition of the suffix ""ai"". However the plural possessive suffix ""ai"" and the plural masculine suffix ""iym"" can be used as a majestic plural when referring to the Abrahamic God or a suzerain, similar to the royal we in English. For example the Hebrew word for ""owner"" is ""adon"". A slave's owner is referred to as his ""adon"" (singular) however an animal's owner is referred to as its ""adoniym"" meaning ""their owners"" (plural) even if the owner is a single person. Similarly a slave would refer to his master as adoni (my owner) but to multiple masters as adonai (my owners). However when referring to the God of Israel humans use the majestic possessive plural pronoun ""Adonai"" instead of the singular possessive pronoun ""adoni"", although the God of Israel is absolutely singular (see Deut. 6:4).  If one refers to a single sustainer or destroyer one uses shada and shadad respectively. If one refers to multiple sustainers or destroyers one would use the plural shadayim and shadadiym respectively. If one refers to one's sustainer or destroyer (possessive singular) both words become shaddi and if one refers to one's sustainers and destroyers (possessive plural) both words become shaddai. Since all epithets referring to the Abrahamic God in Hebrew are in the majestic plural, God is referred to as El Shaddai (the force that is my ultimate sustainer and destroyer) in the possessive majestic plural and not as El Shaddi (the force that is my sustainer and destroyer) in the possessive singular.  If this theory is correct then the term El Shaddai is an epithet that alludes to the primary aspects of the Abrahamic God as the solitary being who creates, sustains, changes, and destroys the universe and all that is within it. Interestingly enough when the epithet El Shaddai is considered with YHWH (the proper name of the God of Israel, derived from the root word ""howa"" meaning to exist or come into being, and meaning literally the ""cause of all existence"" or ""the one whose existence is absolute""), they show a surprising correlation to the concept of the Trimurti the triune Godhead in Hinduism consisting of Brahman (the cause of reality and existence), Vishnu (the creator and sustainer), and Shiva (the changer and destroyer). Shaddai as a toponym. The term may mean ""God of the mountains,"" referring to the Mesopotamian divine mountain. The term was one of the patriarchal names for the tribal god of the Mesopotamians. In Exodus 6:3, El Shaddai is identified explicitly with the God of Abraham and with YHWH. The term appears chiefly in the Torah. This could also refer to the Israelite camp's stay at Mount Sinai where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments. Shaddai was a late Bronze Age Amorite city on the banks of the Euphrates river, in northern Syria. The site of its ruin-mound is called Tel eth-Thadyen: ""Thadyen"" being the modern Arabic rendering of the original West Semitic ""Shaddai."" It has been conjectured that El Shaddai was therefore the ""God of Shaddai"" and associated in tradition with Abraham, and the inclusion of the Abrahamic stories into the Hebrew Bible may have brought the northern name with them (see Documentary hypothesis). Shaddai in the Midrash. There is a Midrashic interpretation as an acronym standing for ""Guardian of the Doors of Israel"" (Hebrew: שׁוֹמֶר דְלָתוֹת יִשְׂרָאֶל). This acronym, which is commonly found as carvings or writings on the mezuzah, which is placed on the doorposts of Jewish homes and other dwellings. Still another view is that ""El Shaddai"" is composed of the Hebrew relative pronoun She (Shin plus vowel segol), or, as in this case, as Sha (Shin plus vowel patach followed by a dagesh, cf. A Beginner's Handbook to Biblical Hebrew, John Marks and Virgil Roger, Nashville:Abingdon, 1978 ""Relative Pronoun, p.60, par.45) The noun containing the dagesh is the Hebrew word Dai meaning ""enough,sufficient, sufficiency"" (cf. Ben Yehudah's Pocket English-Hebrew/Hebrew-English,New York, NY:Pocket Books, Simon & Schuster Inc.,1964,p. 44). This is the same word used in the Passover Haggadah, Dayeinu, which means ""It would have been enough for us."" The song Dayeinu celebrates the various miracles God performed while liberating the Hebrews from Egyptian servitude. It is understood as such by The Stone Edition of the Chumash (Torah) published by the Orthodox Jewish publisher Art Scroll, editors Rabbi Nosson Scherman/Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz, Brooklyn, New York: Mesorah Publications,Ltd. 2nd edition, 1994, cf. Exodus 6:3 commentary p. 319. The Talmud explains it this way, but says that ""Shaddai"" stands for ""Mi she'Amar Dai L'olamo"" - ""He who said 'Enough' to His world."" When God was creating the world, He stopped the process at a certain point, holding back creation from reaching its full completion, and thus the name embodies God's power to stop creation. It is often paraphrased in English translations as ""Almighty"" although this is an interpretive element. The name then refers to the pre-Mosaic patriarchal understanding of deity as ""God who is sufficient."" God is sufficient, that is, to supply all of one's needs, and therefore by derivation ""almighty"". It may also be understood as an allusion to the singularity of deity, ""El"", as opposed to ""Elohim"" (plural), being sufficient or enough for the early patriarchs of Judaism. To this was latter added the Mosaic conception of the tetragrammaton YHWH, meaning a God who is sufficient in Himself, that is, a self-determined eternal Being qua Being, for whom limited descriptive names cannot apply. This may have been the meaning the Hebrew phrase ""ehyeh asher ehyeh"" (which translates roughly as ""I will be that which I will be"") and which is how God describes himself to Moses cf. Exodus 3:13-15. This phrase can be applied to the tetragrammaton YHWH, which can be understood as an anagram for the three States of Being: past, present and future, conjoined with the conjunctive Hebrew letter vav. Biblical translations. The Septuagint and other early translations usually translate ""El Shaddai"" as ""God Almighty."" However in the Greek of the Septuagint translation of Psalm 91.1, ""Shaddai"" is translated as ""the God of heaven."" ""God Almighty"" is the translation followed by most modern English translations of the Hebrew scriptures, including the popular New International Version and Good News Bible. The translation team behind the New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) however maintain that the meaning is uncertain, and that translating ""El Shaddai"" as ""Almighty God"" is inaccurate. The NJB leaves it untranslated as ""Shaddai,"" and makes footnote suggestions that it should perhaps be understood as ""God of the Mountain"" from the Accadian ""shadu,"" or ""God of the open wastes"" from the Hebrew ""sadeh"" and the secondary meaning of the Accadian word.

wikipedia-1648387," Barrett M82  The M82, standardized by the US Military as the M107, is a recoil-operated, semi-automatic anti-materiel rifle developed by the American Barrett Firearms Manufacturing company. A heavy SASR (Special Application Scoped Rifle), it is used by many units and armies around the world. It is also called the ""Light Fifty"" for its .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) chambering. The weapon is found in two variants, the original M82A1 (and A3) and the bullpup M82A2. The M82A2 is no longer manufactured, though the XM500 can be seen as its successor. Overview. Barrett Firearms Manufacturing was founded by Ronnie Barrett for the sole purpose of building semi-automatic rifles chambered for the powerful 12.7×99mm NATO (.50 BMG) ammunition, originally developed for and used in M2 Browning machine guns. Barrett began his work in the early 1980s and the first working rifles were available in 1982, hence the designation M82. Barrett designed every single part of the weapon personally and then went on to market the weapon and mass-produce it out of his own pocket. He continued to develop his rifle through the 1980s, and developed the improved M82A1 rifle by 1986. The first conventional military success was the sale of about 100 M82A1 rifles to the Swedish Army in 1989. Major success followed in 1990, when the United States armed forces purchased significant numbers of the M82A1 during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in Kuwait and Iraq. About 125 rifles were initially bought by the United States Marine Corps, and orders from the Army and Air Force soon followed. The M82A1 is known by the US military as the SASR—""Special Applications Scoped Rifle"", and it was and still is used as an anti-materiel rifle and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) tool. The long effective range, over (1.1 miles), along with high energy and availability of highly effective ammunition such as API and Raufoss Mk 211, allows for effective operations against targets like radar cabins, trucks, parked aircraft and the like. The M82 can also be used to defeat human targets from standoff range or against targets behind cover. However, anti-personnel use is not a major application for the M82 (or any other .50 BMG rifle, for that matter). There is a widespread misconception that a number of treaties have banned use of the .50 BMG against human targets. However, the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's office has issued a legal opinion that the .50 BMG and even the Raufoss Mk 211 round are legal for use against enemy personnel. Further development led to the M82A2 bullpup rifle in 1987, which was a reduced-recoil design to be fired from the shoulder. It failed to make an impression on the world firearms market, and was soon dropped from production. However, in 2006, Barrett completed development of the XM500, which has a bullpup configuration similar to the M82A2. The latest derivative of the M82 family is the M82A1M rifle, adopted by U.S. Marine Corps as the M82A3 SASR and bought in large numbers. This rifle differs from M82A1 in that it has a full length Picatinny rail that allows a wide variety of scopes and sighting devices to be mounted on the rifle. Other changes are the addition of a rear monopod, slightly lightened mechanism, and detachable bipod and muzzle brake. Another variant of the original weapon is the M82A1A Special Application Scoped Rifle, an almost identical model but specifically designed to fire the Raufoss Mk 211 Mod 0 round, a type of API (Armour Piercing Incendiary) ammunition. Barrett M82 rifles were bought by various military and police forces from at least 30 countries, such as Belgium, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Jamaica, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and others. The M82 also is widely used for civilian .50 caliber long range shooting competitions, being fired accurately out to and even farther. The United States Coast Guard's Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron and Law Enforcement Detachments use versions of the Barrett M107 to disable the engines of go-fast boats carrying illegal drugs. Barrett M82 rifles have also attracted attention from civilian law enforcement agencies; they have been adopted by the New York City Police Department as well as the Pittsburgh Police. If it becomes necessary to immobilize a vehicle, a .50 BMG round in the engine block will shut it down quickly. If it is necessary to breach barriers, a .50 BMG round will penetrate most commercial brick walls and concrete blocks. According to the documentary ""The Brooklyn Connection"", M82s smuggled into Kosovo by sympathizers in the United States quickly became popular long range sniper rifles in the Kosovo Liberation Army. In Northern Ireland during the 1990s, the South Armagh Brigade of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) used Barrett rifles against the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary police. The Barrett M82A1 rifle was used in 2002 as a platform for the experimental OSW (Objective Sniper Weapon) prototype. This weapon was fitted with a shorter barrel of 25 mm caliber, and fired high-explosive shells developed for the 25×59 mm OCSW (Objective Crew Served Weapon) automatic grenade launcher. The experimental OSW showed an increased effectiveness against various targets, but the recoil was beyond human limitations. This weapon, also known as the Barrett ""Payload Rifle"", has now been designated the XM109. M82 to M107. The XM107 was originally intended to be a bolt-action sniper rifle, and it was selected by the U.S. Army in a competition between such weapons. However, the decision was made that the U.S. Army did not, in fact, require such a weapon. The rifle originally selected under the trials to be the XM107 was the Barrett M95. Then the Army decided on the Barrett M82, a semi-automatic rifle. In summer 2002, the M82 finally emerged from its Army trial phase and was approved for ""full materiel release"", meaning it was officially adopted as the Long Range Sniper Rifle, Caliber .50, M107. The M107 uses a Leupold 4.5–14×50 Mark 4 scope. The Barrett M107 is a .50 caliber, shoulder fired, semi-automatic sniper rifle. Like its predecessors the rifle is said to have manageable recoil for a weapon of its size owing to the barrel assembly that itself absorbs force, moving inward toward the receiver against large springs with every shot. Additionally the weapon's weight and large muzzle brake also assist in recoil reduction. Various changes were made to the original M82A1 to create the M107, with new features such as a lengthened accessory rail, rear grip, and monopod socket. Barrett has recently been tasked with developing a lightweight version of the M107 under the ""Anti-Materiel Sniper Rifle Congressional Program"", and has already come up with a scheme to build important component parts such as the receiver frame and muzzle brake out of lighter weight materials. The Barrett M107, like previous members of the M82 line, is also referred to as the Barrett ""Light Fifty."" The designation has in many instances supplanted earlier ones, with the M107 being voted one of 2005's Top 10 Military Inventions by the U.S. Army. Barrett M107CQ. A commercial development of the ""new"" M107, the M107CQ is specifically designed where the firepower of a .50 caliber rifle is required, but the bulk of the M82/M107 series prevents the weapon from being used. The M107CQ is 9"" shorter in overall length (all in the barrel) and 5 pounds lighter than the M107. According to the manufacturer, the M107CQ is suitable for use in helicopters, force protection watercraft, tactical scout land vehicles, and as an urban soldier's combat multiplier for close quarter battles. Barrett M107A1. In October 2010, Barrett unofficially reported production of the M107 had ceased; and in January 2011 the company announced that its successor, the M107A1 was available for commercial release. Significant enhancements include a reduction in weight of 5 pounds, a new cylindrical titanium muzzle brake and titanium barrel key/recoil buffer system which allows the weapon to operate with a Barrett-designed suppressor, and other functional modifications that increase durability and operator utility. Technical description. The M82 is a short recoil semi-automatic firearm. When the gun is fired, the barrel initially recoils for a short distance (about ), being securely locked by the rotating bolt. After the short travel, a post on the bolt engaged in the curved cam track in the receiver turns the bolt to unlock it from the barrel. As soon as the bolt unlocks, the accelerator arm strikes it back, transferring part of the recoil energy of the barrel to the bolt to achieve reliable cycling. Then the barrel is stopped and the bolt continues back, to extract and eject a spent case. On its return stroke, the bolt strips the fresh cartridge from the box magazine and feeds it into the chamber and finally locks itself to the barrel. The striker is also cocked on the return stroke of the bolt. The gun is fed from a large detachable box magazine holding up to 10 rounds, although a rare 12 round magazine was developed for use during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. The receiver is made from two parts (upper and lower), stamped from sheet steel and connected by cross-pins. The heavy barrel is fluted to improve heat dissipation and save weight, and fitted with a large and effective reactive muzzle brake. On the earlier models the muzzle brakes had a round cross-section; later M82 rifles are equipped with two-chamber brakes of rectangular cross-section. M82A1 rifles are fitted with scope mount and folding backup iron sights, should the glass scope break. The U.S. military M82 rifles are often equipped with Leupold Mark 4 telescopic sights. The M82A1M (USMC M82A3) rifles have long Picatinny accessory rails mounted and US Optics telescopic sights. Every M82 rifle is equipped with a folding carrying handle and a folding bipod (both are detachable on the M82A3). The M82A3 is also fitted with a detachable rear monopod under the butt. The buttpad is fitted with a soft recoil pad to further decrease the felt recoil. M82A1 and M82A3 rifles could be mounted on the M3 or M122 infantry tripods (originally intended for machine guns) or on vehicles using the special Barrett soft-mount. The M82A1 can be fitted with a carry sling but according to those who carried it in the field, the M82 is too uncomfortable to be carried on a sling due to its excessive length and heavy weight. It is usually carried in a special carry soft or hard case. The M82A2 differed from M82A1 mostly in its configuration—that the pistol grip along with trigger had been placed ahead of the magazine, and the buttpad has been placed below the receiver, just after the magazine. An additional forward grip was added below the receiver, and the scope mount has been moved forward too. The maximum effective range of the M107 is 2,000 yards (1,829m). The maximum range of this weapon (specifically the M107 variant) is 7,450 yards (4,000m), which is the distance quoted in the owner's manual that should be allowed downrange for bullet travel. Fifty caliber (and larger) rounds have the potential to travel great distances if fired in an artillery-like fashion, necessitating the observance of large safety margins when firing on a range. "
wikipedia-11008889," Dos de Mayo Uprising  The Dos de Mayo of 1808, was a rebellion by the people of Madrid against the occupation of the city by French troops, provoking a brutal repression by the French Imperial forces and triggering the Peninsular War. Background. The city had been under the occupation of Napoleon's army since 23 March of the same year. King Charles IV had been forced to abdicate in favour of his son Ferdinand VII, and at the time of the uprising both were in the French city of Bayonne at the insistence of Napoleon. An attempt by the French general Joachim Murat to move the daughter and youngest son of Charles IV to Bayonne led to a popular rebellion that was harshly suppressed by French troops after hours of fierce street fighting. The uprising in Madrid, together with the subsequent proclamation as king of Napoleon's brother Joseph, provoked resistance across Spain to French rule. Beginning of the uprising. The spark that provoked the rebellion was the move by the French Marshal in command of Madrid, Joachim Murat, to send the daughter of Charles IV and the Infante Francisco de Paula to the French city of Bayonne. Murat was the brother-in-law of Napoleon, and would later become king of Naples. Initially the governing council of the city refused the request from Murat, but eventually gave way after receiving a message from Ferdinand VII who was also in Bayonne at this time. On 2 May a crowd began to gather in front of the Royal Palace in Madrid. Those gathered entered the palace grounds in an attempt to prevent the removal of Francisco de Paula. Marshal Murat sent a battalion of grenadiers from the Imperial Guard to the palace along with artillery detachments. The latter opened fire on the assembled crowd, and the rebellion began to spread to other parts of the city. What followed was street fighting in different areas of Madrid as the poorly armed population confronted the French troops. Murat had quickly moved the majority of his troops into the city and there was heavy fighting around the Puerta del Sol and the Puerta de Toledo. Marshal Murat imposed martial law in the city and assumed full control of the administration. Little by little the French regained control of the city, and many hundreds of people died in the fighting. The painting by the Spanish artist Goya, ""The Charge of the Mamelukes"", portrays the street fighting that took place. There were Spanish troops stationed in the city, but they remained confined to barracks. The only Spanish troops to disobey orders were from the artillery units at the barracks of Monteleón, who joined the uprising. Two officers of these troops, Luis Daoíz de Torres and Pedro Velarde y Santillán are still commemorated as heroes of the rebellion. Both died during the French assault of the barracks, as the rebels were reduced by vastly superior numbers. Impact of the uprising. The repression following the crushing of the initial rebellion was harsh. Murat created a military commission on the evening of 2 May to be presided over by General Grouchy. This commission issued death sentences to all of those captured who were bearing weapons of any kind. In a statement issued that day Murat said: ""The population of Madrid, led astray, has given itself to revolt and murder. French blood has flowed. It demands vengeance. All those arrested in the uprising, arms in hand, will be shot."" All public meetings were prohibited and an order was issued requiring all weapons to be handed in to the authorities. Hundreds of prisoners were executed the following day, a scene captured in a famous painting by Goya, The Third of May 1808. On the same 2 May, in the nearby town of Móstoles, the arrival of the news of the repression prompted Juan Pérez Villamil, who was secretary of the Admiralty and prosecutor of the Supreme War Council, to encourage the mayors of the town, Andrés Torrejón and Simón Hernández, to sign a declaration of war calling all the Spaniards against the invaders. The name of this declaration was ""Bando de los alcaldes de Móstoles"" or ""bando de la Independencia"" which translates to ""Declaration of Independence"". While the French occupiers hoped that their rapid suppression of the uprising would demonstrate their control of Spain, the rebellion actually gave considerable impetus to the resistance. In the weeks that followed there were further rebellions in different parts of the country. The 2nd of May is now a public holiday in the Community of Madrid. The place where the artillery barracks of Monteleón was located is now a square called the Plaza Dos de Mayo, and the district surrounding the square is known as Malasaña in memory of one of the heroines of the revolt, the teenager Manuela Malasaña, who was executed by French troops in the aftermath of the revolt. Several memorials to the heroes of 2 May are located over the city, including the Monumento a los Caidos por España (Monument to the fallen of Spain). "

He is the son of jazz bassist Grachan Moncur II and the nephew of jazz saxophonist Al Cooper. Biography. Born in New York City and raised in Newark, New Jersey, Moncur began playing the cello at age nine, and switched to the trombone at eleven. In high school he attended the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina, the private school where Dizzy Gillespie had studied. While still in school he began sitting in with touring jazz musicians on their way through town, such as Art Blakey and Jackie McLean, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. After high school he toured with Ray Charles (1959–1962), Art Farmer's and Benny Golson's Jazztet (1962), and Sonny Rollins. He took part in two classic Jackie McLean albums in the early 1960s, ""One Step Beyond"" and ""Destination... Out!"", to which he also contributed the bulk of compositions and which led to two influential albums of his own for Blue Note Records, ""Evolution"" (1963) with Jackie McLean and Lee Morgan, and ""Some Other Stuff"" (1964) with Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter. Moncur joined Archie Shepp's ensemble and recorded with other avant-garde players such as Marion Brown, Beaver Harris and Roswell Rudd (the other big name in free jazz trombone). During a stay in Paris in the summer of 1969, he recorded two albums as a leader for the famous BYG Actuel label, ""New Africa"" and ""Aco Dei de Madrugada"", as well as appearing as a sideman on numerous other releases of the label. In 1974, the Jazz Composer's Orchestra commissioned him to write ""Echoes of Prayer"" (1974), a jazz symphony featuring a full orchestra plus vocalists and jazz soloists. His sixth album as a leader, ""Shadows"" (1977) was released only in Japan. Unfortunately, he was subsequently plagued by health problems and copyright disputes and recorded only rarely. Through the 1980s he recorded with Cassandra Wilson (1985), played occasionally with the Paris Reunion Band and Frank Lowe, appeared on John Patton's ""Soul Connection"" (1983), but mostly concentrated on teaching.

wikipedia-63078," Tsuguharu Foujita  Education. In 1910 when he was twenty-four years old Foujita graduated from what is now the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. Paris. Three years later he went to Montparnasse in Paris, France. When he arrived there, knowing nobody, he met Amedeo Modigliani, Pascin, Chaim Soutine, and Fernand Léger and became friends with Juan Gris, Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Foujita claimed in his memoir that he met Picasso less than a week after his arrival, but a recent biographer, relying on letters Foujita sent to his first wife in Japan, clearly shows that it was several months until he met Picasso. He also took dance lessons from the legendary Isadora Duncan. Foujita had his first studio at no. 5 rue Delambre in Montparnasse where he became the envy of everyone when he eventually made enough money to install a bathtub with hot running water. Many models came over to Foujita's place to enjoy this luxury, among them Man Ray's very liberated lover, Kiki, who boldly posed for Foujita in the nude in the outdoor courtyard. Another portrait of Kiki titled """"Reclining Nude with Toile de Jouy"","" shows her lying naked against an ivory-white background. It was the sensation of Paris at the ""Salon d'Automne"" in 1922, selling for more than 8,000 francs. His life in Montparnasse is documented in several of his works, including the etching A la Rotonde or Café de la Rotonde of 1925/7, part of the Tableaux de Paris series published in 1929. Marriage. Foujita's first marriage was in Japan whilst still a student. After travelling to Paris to pursue his art, a quiet divorce was arranged. In March 1917 in the Café de la Rotonde, Foujita met a young lady by the name of Fernande Barrey. At first, she totally ignored Foujita's efforts to engage her in conversation. However, early the next morning, Foujita showed up at Fernande's place with a blue corsage he had made overnight. Intrigued, she offered him a pot of tea and they were married 13 days later. Within a few years, particularly after his 1918 exposition, he achieved great fame as a painter of beautiful women and cats in a very original technique. He is one of the few Montparnasse artists who made a great deal of money in his early years. By 1925, Tsuguharu Foujita had received the Belgian Order of Leopold and the French government awarded him the Legion of Honor. In 1918, a trip to the south of France was organized by the Polish poet Léopold Zborowski, who had the idea that his artist-friends could sell pictures there to rich tourists. Foujita and his wife went along as did Soutine, Modigliani with his lover, Jeanne Hébuterne. The trip was not, however, a success and the group had to survive on the advances that Foujita had obtained from his Paris dealer. By the time the final reckoning arrived even those funds had run out, and their landlord, ignoring the offers of pieces of art, confiscated all their baggage in lieu of payment. In 1921, he became involved with Lucie Badoul, whom he called Oyuki, or ""Rose Snow"". She would become his third wife. The relationship ended when she became the lover, then the wife of the surrealist poet Robert Desnos. Latin America and Japan. After the breakup of his third marriage, and his flight to Brazil in 1931 (with his new love, Mady), Foujita traveled and painted all over Latin America, giving hugely successful exhibitions along the way. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, 60,000 people attended his exhibition, and more than 10,000 queued up for his autograph. In 1932 he contributed a work to the Pax Mundi, a large folio book produced by the League of Nations calling for a prolonged world peace. However, by 1933 he was welcomed back as a minor celebrity to Japan where he stayed and became a noted producer of militaristic propaganda during the war. For example, in 1938 the Imperial Navy Information Office supported his visit to China as an official war artist. Foujita left Japan after the war. Today, his works can be found in the Bridgestone Museum of Art and in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, and more than 100 in the Hirano Masakichi Art Museum in Akita. Last work. On his return to France, Foujita converted to Catholicism. He was baptised in Reims cathedral on 14 October 1959, with René Lalou (the head of the Mumm champagne house) as his godfather and Françoise Taittinger as his godmother. This is reflected in his last major work,at the age of 80, the design, building and decoration of the Foujita chapel in the gardens of the Mumm champagne house in Reims, France, which he completed in 1966, not long before his death. Tsuguharu Foujita died of cancer on January 29, 1968 in Zürich, Switzerland and was interred in the Cimetière de Villiers-le-Bâcle, Essonne département, France. In 2003, his coffin was reinterred at the Foujita chapel under the flagstones in the position he originally intended when constructing the chapel. "

wikipedia-668493," Cayman Brac  Cayman Brac is an island that is part of the Cayman Islands. It lies in the Caribbean Sea about 90 miles (145 km) northeast of Grand Cayman and 5 miles (8 km) east of Little Cayman. It is about 12 miles (19 km) long, with an average width of 1 mile (2 km). Its terrain is the most prominent of the three Cayman Islands due to ""The Bluff"", a large central limestone outcrop that rises steadily along the length of the island up to 140 feet (43 metres) above sea level at the eastern end. The island is named after this prominent feature, as ""brac"" is a Gaelic name for a bluff. The ""Teignmouth Electron"", the boat in which Donald Crowhurst attempted to sail round the world single-handed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, has been left to decay on the south coast of Cayman Brac. History. Christopher Columbus sighted Cayman Brac and its sister island, Little Cayman, on 10 May 1503 when his ship was blown off course during a trip between Hispaniola and Panama. He named them ""Las Tortugas"" because of the many turtles he spotted on the islands. The Cayman Islands were renamed by Sir Francis Drake, who came upon the islands during a voyage in 1586. He used the word ""Caymanas"", taken from the Carib name for crocodiles after seeing many of the large crocodilians. Many people believe he had only seen the Rock Iguanas that inhabit the island today. During the heyday of piracy, pirates would use Cayman Brac as a haven and a place to replenish their supplies as there are a number of fresh water wells on the island and had many sources of food included in the local flora and fauna. Attractions. Diving. Of interest to scuba divers is a 330-foot (100-m) Russian Koni class frigate built in the Soviet Union in 1984 for the Cuban Navy. It is one of only a few sunken Soviet naval vessels in the Western Hemisphere, and the only one that is easily dived. The Koni II class frigate was purchased and sunk by the Cayman Islands government in September 1996. Originally designated ""356"", the frigate was rechristened the ""M/V Captain Keith Tibbetts"", after a well-known Cayman Brac politician. The wreck is the only Russian warship that divers can explore in the Western hemisphere. It originally sat upright in approximately 90 feet (27 m) with the deck at 60 feet (18 m), until wave action generated by a winter Norwester storm (December 1998-January 1999) which nearly tore the ship in two. The result was that the fore section tipped to about a 45 degree angle in relation to the remainder of the still-upright aft portion. and the midships became a debris field. The wreck's stern area was essentially unaffected. The frigate is located in a sandy area with generally good visibility, approximately 200 m (650 feet) offshore (a fairly long swim) from 'Buccaneer', on the island's north side, near the western tip of the island. There are numerous openings in the upper portion of the ship for non-wreck certified divers. Many more openings are available since the ship broke in half. The site also serves as an artificial reef. Other interesting dive sites are Radar Reef, Cemetery Wall, and the Wilderness Wall, all well covered in corals and with a wide diversity of marine life. Caves. Cayman Brac also appeals to visitors of many persuasions besides divers. Caves are found around the island, offering spelunkers a glimpse of delicate underground formations. Steps and, in some cases, ladders have been constructed to allow visitor access to more remote caves. One cave, Rebecca's Cave,[http://www.Rebeccascave.com] contains the grave of a young girl lost in a struggle against the ravages of the great '32 Hurricane, and it is a Cayman National Heritage Site. Rock climbing. Rock climbing was developed beginning in 1992 and the island is now known as a world-class climbing destination. One must be somewhat experienced to climb here as the terrain is steep, many times over-vertical. Walking and hiking trails. Walking and hiking trails have been opened by the Nature Tourism Programme which allow exploration of the island's dense Karst forestation. Unique flora and fauna thrive here and can be observed in the wild. Fishing. Cayman Brac's waters are especially utilized for both fishing and the pursuit of big game fish. Local economy. The local economy tends to be concentrated in three areas which are probably typical for many Caribbean locales: tourism, municipal government, and local enterprises. Although on the Brac, the government (including Cayman Airways, the National carrier) is the largest employer. Some of the more economically prominent families in Grand Cayman originate from Cayman Brac, namely the Kirkconnell's, Foster's, Walton's, and Scott's. The majority of the tourism sector is concentrated on scuba diving, although this is in recent decline in the hospitality sector, with one of the two local hotels, Divi Resorts, having closed operations in 2006. The island's economy was also adversely impacted by significant damage from Category 4 Hurricane Paloma in November 2008. A local enterprise that is nearly unique to Cayman Brac is its artists who work in a local stone known as Caymanite, typically making jewelry or small stone carvings. Two of these artists have been Mr. Eddie Scott and Mr. Tenson Scott, whose works have won national contests, as well as being the official gift to Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Andrew during the 1994 State Visit. For the 2011 Wedding of Prince William, the official gift was crafted by Mr. Horacio Esteban, who grew up on Cayman Brac and is currently living on Grand Cayman. Charles Kirkconnell Airport serves the island, former Gerrard Smith International Airport. Education. Cayman Islands Education Department operates two primary schools and one secondary school on the island. These include: "

wikipedia-1787569," Metropolitan planning organization  A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally mandated and federally funded transportation policy-making organization in the United States that is made up of representatives from local government and governmental transportation authorities. The United States Congress passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962, which required the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs in order to ensure that existing and future expenditures of governmental funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (“3‑C”) planning process. Statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes are governed by federal law (). Transparency through public access to participation in the planning process and electronic publication of plans now is required by federal law. As of 2012, there are 342 MPOs in the United States. Purpose. Why MPOs are essential: In other words, the federal government wished to see federal transportation funds spent in a manner that has a basis in metropolitan region-wide plans developed through intergovernmental collaboration, rational analysis, and consensus-based decision making. Governance. Typically, an MPO governance structure includes a variety of committees as well as a professional staff. The “policy committee” is the top-level decision-making body for the planning organization. In most MPOs, the policy committee comprises: With only a few unique exceptions nationwide (such as the MPO in Portland, Oregon), MPO policy committee members are not elected directly by citizens. Rather, a policy committee member typically is an elected or appointed official of one of the MPO’s constituent local jurisdictions. The policy committee member thus has legal authority to speak and act on behalf of that jurisdiction in the MPO setting. Federal law, however, does not require members of an MPO policy committee to be representatives of the metropolitan areas' populations. Systematic studies have found that MPO policy committees' representations of urban municipalities and disadvantaged minority populations in their areas are less than proportional to population. The policy committee’s responsibilities include debating and making decisions on key MPO actions and issues, including adoption of the metropolitan long-range transportation plans, transportation improvement programs, annual planning work programs, budgets, and other policy documents. The policy committee also may play an active role in key decision points or milestones associated with MPO plans and studies, as well as conducting public hearings and meetings. An appointed advisory committee (CAC) develops the recommendations for consideration by the policy committee and establishes a ranked proposal for work plans.  Most MPOs also establish a technical committee to act as an advisory body to the policy committee for transportation issues that primarily are technical in nature. The technical committee interacts with the MPO’s professional staff on technical matters related to planning, analysis tasks, and projects. Through this work, the technical committee develops recommendations on projects and programs for policy committee consideration. Metropolitan travel forecasting is one of the key roles that the technical committee supports. The technical committee typically comprises staff-level officials of local, state, and federal agencies. In addition, a technical committee may include representatives of interest groups, various transportation modes, and local citizens. A 2005 survey of MPOs nationally commissioned in preparation of ""Special Report 288"" of the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies found that ""forecast by negotiation"" was a common method of projecting future population and employment growth for use in travel forecasting, suggesting rent-seeking behavior on the part of MPO committees influencing the technical staff.  Usually MPOs retain a core professional staff in order to ensure the ability to carry out the required metropolitan planning process in an effective and expeditious manner. The size and qualifications of this staff may vary by MPO, since no two metropolitan areas have identical planning needs Most MPOs, however, require at least some staff dedicated solely to MPO process oversight and management because of the complexity of the process and need to ensure that requirements are properly addressed. Core functions. There are five core functions of an MPO: If the metropolitan area is designated as an air quality non-attainment or maintenance area, then Presently, most MPOs have no authority to raise revenues such as to levy taxes on their own, rather, they are designed to allow local officials to decide collaboratively how to spend available federal and other governmental transportation funds in their urbanized areas. The funding for the operations of an MPO comes from a combination of federal transportation funds and required matching funds from state and local governments. Structure of MPO organizations. MPOs differ greatly in various parts of the country and even within states. Some have large staffs, while others may include only a director and a transportation planner. Sometimes the professional staff of an MPO is provided by a county or a council of governments. In many urban areas, existing organizations such as county governments or councils of government also function as MPOs. The MPO role also may be played by an independent governmental organization or a regional government. In the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, for example, the Metro is the MPO. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area, the Metropolitan Council is the MPO.  An example of a medium-sized MPO is the Lexington Area MPO in Kentucky. An example of a small MPO is the Kittery Area MPO in Maine.  Another MPO planning organization has developed in the area of western central Florida. Several MPOs there, with governance over eight counties, have developed a greater regional planning committee, the Chairs Coordinating Committee (CCC), composed of the chairs of seven MPOs and the chairs of their appointed advisory committee (or their representatives) in order to coordinate transportation planning for the region, that is compatible with all, as well as addressing the challenges of long range planning for a large and growing region that has overlapping issues among the MPOs or transportation plans that extend throughout the entire area. Often the members of the executive committee of an MPO act interchangeably as the representative to this seven-MPO regional committee. This committee meets less frequently than the participating MPOs. Evolving role. The enactment of the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) ushered in a “renaissance” for MPOs. After a decade or more of being consigned to a minimal role in transportation planning, ISTEA directed additional federal funding to MPOs, expanded their authority to select projects, and mandated new metropolitan planning initiatives. For the first time, state transportation officials were required to consult seriously with local representatives on MPO governing boards regarding matters of project prioritization and decision-making. These changes had their roots in the need to address increasingly difficult transportation problems—in particular, the more complicated patterns of traffic congestion that arose with the suburban development boom in the previous decades. Many recognized that the problems could only be addressed effectively through a stronger federal commitment to regional planning.  The legislation that emerged, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), was signed into federal law by President George H. W. Bush in December 1991. It focused on improving transportation, not as an end in itself, but as the means to achieve important national goals including economic progress, cleaner air, energy conservation, and social equity. ISTEA promoted a transportation system in which different modes and facilities—highway, transit, pedestrian, bicycle, aviation, and marine—were integrated to allow a ""seamless"" movement of both goods and people. New funding programs provided greater flexibility in the use of funds, particularly regarding using previously restricted highway funds for transit development, improved ""intermodal"" connections, and emphasized upgrades to existing facilities over building new capacity—particularly roadway capacity. To accomplish more serious metropolitan planning, ISTEA doubled federal funding for MPO operations and required the agencies to evaluate a variety of multimodal solutions to roadway congestion and other transportation problems. MPOs also were required to broaden public participation in the planning process and to see that investment decisions contributed to meeting the air quality standards of the Clean Air Act Amendments.  In addition, ISTEA placed a new requirement on MPOs to conduct “fiscally constrained planning”, and ensure that long-range transportation plans and short-term transportation improvement programs were fiscally constrained; in other words, adopted plans and programs can not include more projects than reasonably can be expected to be funded through existing or projected sources of revenues. This new requirement represented a major conceptual shift for many MPOs (and others in the planning community), since the imposition of fiscal discipline on plans now required, not only understanding how much money might be available, but how to prioritize investment needs and make difficult choices among competing needs. Adding to this complexity is the need to plan across transportation modes and develop approaches for multimodal investment prioritization and decision making. It is in this context of greater prominence, funding, and requirements that MPOs function today. An annual element is composed of transportation improvement projects contained in an area's transportation improvement program (TIP), which is proposed for implementation during the current year. The annual element is submitted to the U.S. Department of Transportation as part of the required planning process. The passage of Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users SAFETEA‑LU in 2005 created new and revised requirements for transportation planning and programs. Although SAFETEA-LU increased standards, most MPOs already were in compliance with the regulations. Some of the planning topic areas include transportation systems security, emergency preparedness, public participation plans for metropolitan planning, and requiring the electronic publication of plans and TIP/STIP by the MPOs. SAFETEA-LU requires that the statewide transportation planning process and the metropolitan planning process shall provide for consideration of projects and strategies that will protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and state and local planned growth and economic development patterns USC 5303(g)(3) and 23 USC 134(g)(3).

wikipedia-895712," European Le Mans Series  The European Le Mans Series (ELMS) is a European sports car racing endurance series based around the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and run by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The European Le Mans Series is similar to the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) based in the United States and Canada that has been running with ACO backing since 1999, which is run by IMSA. ELMS team champions and runners-up receive an automatic entry to the following year's 24 Hours of Le Mans. Originally titled the Le Mans Endurance Series before becoming simply the Le Mans Series in 2006, the series was renamed once more in 2012, reusing a name previously utilized by IMSA in 2001. History. With allowing Don Panoz to bring the rules and racing formulas of the 24 Hours of Le Mans to North America with the creation of the Petit Le Mans in 1998, Don Panoz attempted to build up a series to be based around Petit Le Mans. The aged IMSA GT Championship was taken over and became the new American Le Mans Series, and met with much success in 1999. Europe had lacked a major sports prototype series since the demise of the World Sportscar Championship in 1992. Following the success of the ALMS, Panoz attempting to bring sports prototype racing back to Europe. This led to the 2000 American Le Mans Series season, which included two races in Europe as the Nürburgring and Silverstone Circuit, as well as a round in Australia. These races would serve as a precursor to what would become the separate European Le Mans Series in 2001. The European Le Mans Series was launched for 2001 with five races, including a premier 1000 km race at Estoril, which would be the European equivalent of the 1000 mile Petit Le Mans and earn automatic entries to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for each class winner. To aid in the development of the ELMS, the 2001 season shared some races between both ALMS and ELMS. The 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans, normally ALMS races, were considered optional races for ELMS teams. At the same time, the ELMS races at Donington Park and Jarama were considered optional for ALMS teams. This allowed for the possibility of boosting the draw from international teams to either series. The series was unable to earn much attention from European sportscar teams, especially since the final FIA Sportscar Championship and FIA GT Championship series used similar cars, but different rules which would require teams to modify their cars or buy new cars to comply with ELMS rules. For the ELMS events that included ALMS teams, very few teams actually bothered to make the trip across the Atlantic to participate in races that appeared to have very few serious competitors. Thus the entry lists for each race fell from 25 at the beginning of the season to a mere 14 at season's end, with some classes only having one or two competitors. With a lack of involvement from teams, and less interest from the media due to the lack of teams, the European Le Mans Series folded following the 2001 season. The ACO was not completely satisfied with the fact that IMSA did not fully comply with the ACO's regulations in order to help attract privateer teams, as well as the failure of the FIA Sportscar Championship to succeed in Europe. Seeing the success of the American Le Mans Series, the ACO decided that a series run by themselves would be a better alternative for Europe. The ACO would instead attempt to attract factory backed teams with longer endurance races than ALMS and FIA SCC ran. The series would also be European based instead of international, thus it could be closer to the factories of a large number of sportscar teams to help attract them to the series. In 2003, the ACO announced their intentions to create their own European-based series, named the Le Mans Endurance Series, which would be similar to the original European Le Mans Series, but feature only 1000 km races instead of the shorter, 2 hour 45 minute races used by the ELMS, and less races in a season than the ALMS and FIA SCC to help keep costs down. Winners of the LMES championship would go on to earn automatic entries in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, similar to the American Le Mans Series. The series was initially previewed in an open race run under the LMES banner in 2003 at the 1000km of Le Mans, a one-off event before the season started in 2004. For the 2004 Le Mans Series season, the series participated in four events, including resurrecting classic races like the 1000km Monza, 1000km Nürburgring, 1000 km Silverstone and the Spa 1000 km. A large number of competitors turned out, making the racing very exciting. 2005 saw the series expand to a five race format with the addition of the Istanbul Racing Circuit. In 2007, the LMS held its first and single overseas race with Mil Milhas Brasil as the sixth round. For 2013 a twenty-nine car field has been announced including eleven LMP2 cars and ten LM GTE class cars. "
wikipedia-416058," Battle of Tabouk  The Battle of Tabouk (also called the Battle of Tabuk) was a military expedition, which, according to Muslim biographies, was initiated by the Prophet Muhammad in October 630. Muhammad led a force of as many as 30,000 north to Tabouk in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia, with the intention of engaging the Byzantine army. Though not a battle in the typical sense, if historical the event would represent the opening conflict in the coming Byzantine-Arab wars. There is no contemporary Byzantine account of the events, and much of the details come from later Muslim sources. Noting this, as well as the fact that the armies never met, some Western scholars have questioned the authenticity of the details surrounding the event; though in the Arab world it is widely held as historical. Reasons for war. According to ""Ar-Rahīq al-Makhtum"", a modern Islamic hagiography of Muhammad written by the Indian Muslim author Safi-ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, the reason for war against the Byzantine Empire, was that one of Muhammad's ambassadors was killed by Sharhabeel bin ‘Amr Al-Ghassani (the governor of Al-Balqa). This immediately led to the Battle of Mutah. But Mubarakpuri also claims that event was one of the reasons of the Battle of Tabouk also. Mubarakpuri further mentions that the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, Heraclius was preparing a force to demolish the growing Muslim power in the region. The non Muslim scholar William Muir claims that one of the reasons Heraclius decided to go to War was that he wanted to prevent the recurrence of the Expedition of Ukasha bin Al-Mihsan against the Banu Udrah and military campaigns similar to it. The Banu Udhrah was a Christian tribe that was aligned to the Byzantine Empire, before converting to Islam and aligning themselves to Muhammad. The tribe converted to Islam after Khalid ibn Walid carried out a military campaign in the area, however there were some who were still disaffected, so another campaign was carried out in the area. Preparations for War. The Muslim scholar Ibn Kathir mentions in his tafsir that the Quran verse 9:49 was revealed about the people who make excuses not to participate in the Jihad. In this case Al-Jadd bin Qays made an excuse not participate in the Battle of Tabuk, and Ibn Kathir says that 9:49 verse was revealed because of his excuse. Many rumors of the danger threatening the Muslims was carried to Mecca by Nabateans who traded from Syria to Medina. They carried rumors of Heraclius' preparations and the existence of an enormous army said to number anywhere from 40,000 to several 100,000 besides the Lakhm, Judham and other Arab tribes allied to the Byzantines. Ibn Kathir stated that verse 9:81 was also revealed about the Battle of Tabuk, regarding those who made excuses Ibn Kathir also mentions that verse 9:29 which called for fighting against the people of the book until they pay Jizyah was ""revealed"" while Muhammad was preparing for the Battle of Tabuk, he wrote: Expedition. Muhammad marched northwards to Tabouk, though the Byzantine army did not initiate any form of aggression against the Muslims. The army of 30,000 was a great one, when compared with the previous armies of Islam. Muslims had never marched with such a great number before. After arriving at Tabouk and camping there, Muhammad's army was prepared to face the Byzantines. However the Byzantines were not at Tabouk. They stayed there for a number of days and scouted the area but they never came. Nevertheless, this expedition brought, in itself, credit to the Muslim forces that had gained military reputation in the remote lands of the Arabian Peninsula. The strategic long term consequence of the battle was that many Arab tribes now abandoned the Byzantines and joined with Muhammad, enlarging the Muslim state. Immediate Aftermath. Return to Medina. After returning from Medina, some companions of Muhammad believed that there was no need to fight any longer, after looking around and seeing that there were no enemies remaining to threaten the Muslims, and after the Romans had left the Muslims alone. Muhammad's followers began to sell their weapons, but Muhammad rebuked them, claiming there will always be a need to fight. Then, God revealed a new verse of the Quran. Ibn Kathir mentions this event and the verse as follows: Islamic primary sources. Quran. According to Safi-ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, many verses of Surah Tawbah (chapter 9 of the Quran) are related to the Battle of Tabuk. The Muslim scholar Ibn Kathir mentions that verses 9:42-48, 9:49, 9:81, and 9:29 are all related to the Battle of Tabuk or were revealed during the Battle of Tabuk. "

It is the third and final film based on Baron Cohen's characters from ""Da Ali G Show""; the first were ""Ali G Indahouse"" and ""Borat"", the first film from Media Rights Capital under Universal Pictures banner. Plot. Gay Austrian fashion reporter Brüno Gehard is fired from his own television show, ""Funkyzeit mit Brüno (Funkytime with Brüno)"" after disrupting a Milan Fashion week catwalk (whose audience included Paul McCartney), and his lover Diesel (Clifford Bañagale) leaves him for another man. Accompanied by his assistant's assistant, Lutz, he travels to the United States to become ""the biggest gay Austrian superstar since Arnold Schwarzenegger"". Brüno unsuccessfully attempts an acting career as an extra on NBC's ""Medium"". He then interviews Paula Abdul, using ""Mexican chair-people"" in place of furniture (Abdul goes along with everything, explaining how she aspires to help people, until a naked man, adorned with sushi, is wheeled into the room). He then produces a celebrity interview pilot, showing him dancing erotically, criticizing Jamie-Lynn Spears' fetus with reality TV star Brittny Gastineau, unsuccessfully attempting to ""interview"" actor Harrison Ford, and closing with a close-up of his penis being swung around by pelvic gyrations. A focus group reviewing the pilot hate it, calling it ""worse than cancer"". Brüno then decides to make a sex tape, so he interviews Ron Paul, claiming to have mistaken him for drag queen RuPaul. While waiting in a hotel room with Paul, Brüno flirts with him before undressing, causing Paul to leave angrily and call him ""queer than the blazes"". Brüno consults a spiritualist to contact the deceased Rob Pilatus of Milli Vanilli for advice, miming various sex acts on the invisible ""Pilatus"". He consults charity PR consultants Nicole and Suzanne DeFosset to select a world problem to maximize his fame, choosing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He flies to Jerusalem to interview former Mossad agent Yossi Alpher and Palestinian politician Ghassan Khatib and confuses hummus and Hamas. In an interview with Israeli and Palestinian professors he sings his own ""Dove of Peace"" while forcing the two to caress each other's hands. He also meets with Ayman Abu Aita, a ""terrorist group leader, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades"" in a location described as a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, where he hopes to be kidnapped. Brüno insults Abu Aita's hair then says that ""King Osama"" looks like a dirty wizard or a homeless Santa Claus. Abu Aita's translator orders Brüno to leave. He stops off in Nairobi to pick up a few things, including a child, saying he is ""black gold"". Brüno interviews parents of child models, asking if their toddlers would be ready to lose weight, undergo liposuction, operate ""antiquated heavy machinery"" or ""amateur science"", or dress in Nazi uniforms. On a talk show hosted by Richard Bey, he shows the African American audience a baby he named O.J., whom he acquired in Africa by ""swapping him"" for a U2 Product Red iPod. He shows photographs of the boy covered with bees, on a crucifix and in a jacuzzi next to adults in a 69 position. The audience is appalled and social services take the baby from Brüno, driving him to depression. He goes to a diner to gorge on high-carb junk food. Lutz carries him back to a hotel room. After a night of sex, they awake to find themselves trapped in a bondage mechanism, unable to find the key. They call a hotel engineer for help and are asked to leave. After accosting a group of anti-gay protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church while still in bondage gear and boarding a bus, Brüno and Lutz remove their equipment at Madison County Office of Alternative Sentencing and Release in Huntsville, Alabama. After being arrested, Lutz says he loves Brüno, but Brüno tells him he does not love him, having been influenced by ""carb goggles"". Lutz leaves Brüno. After realizing the biggest names in Hollywood are straight (citing Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, and John Travolta), Brüno consults two Christian gay converters to help him become heterosexual. He attempts activities, such as joining the National Guard, going hunting in Alabama, learning karate, and attending a swingers party at which he is whipped by a dominatrix. These attempts end miserably due to Brüno's failure to keep his gay traits hidden, but he vows to become straight. Eight months later, a now-heterosexual Brüno, under the alias ""Straight Dave"", hosts a cage-fight match in Arkansas, ""Straight Dave's Man Slammin' Maxout"". Lutz appears at the event and calls Brüno a ""faggot"". The two fight, only to rekindle their love, making out and stripping in front of the shocked spectators who throw objects into the cage. The clip gets international press and the now-famous Brüno attempts to marry Lutz and gets O.J. back in exchange for a MacBook Pro. Brüno records a charity song, ""Dove of Peace"", featuring Bono, Elton John (seated at a piano on a Mexican ""chair-person""), Chris Martin, Snoop Dogg, Sting and Slash at Abbey Road Studios. Deleted scenes. The trailers for the film shown in the U.S. included a scene in which Brüno shops for clothing at Sears, telling the sales clerk ""You might find this very hard to believe, but I'm gay"" to which the clerk responds ""Okay"", while maintaining an awkward posture. Michael Jackson incident. Following the sudden death of Michael Jackson on 25 June 2009, a scene from ""Brüno"" was hastily removed from the US theatrical version of the film before its Hollywood premiere later that evening. The scene involved Brüno tricking La Toya Jackson into an interview in which he asked her to take a seat on hunched over Mexican workers substituting for chairs and invited her to eat sushi from the torso of an overweight and hairy naked man. In a ploy to get Michael's phone number, Brüno asked La Toya to let him look at her mobile phone, which she complied with. The scene was later confirmed to be removed from the film permanently, but is included in the DVD and Blu-ray release's special features. Coincidentally, the ""Brüno"" premiere's red carpet also temporarily covered Michael Jackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; fans formed a vigil at the star for the radio commentator also named Michael Jackson instead.  Production. During Baron Cohen's Middle East interview of Alpher and Khatib, he repeatedly conflated Hamas and hummus and feigned belief that the conflict was between Jews and Hindus. The two interviewees (who had received a fee to appear on camera), convinced by the elaborate production, were confused by the questions but generally went along, even when asked by Baron Cohen to hold hands. On 6 June 2008, a riot ensued at a stunt orchestrated by Baron Cohen and the producers of the film as they staged a ""Blue Collar Brawlin'"" in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Patrons were lured to an event billed as cage fighting, held at a convention center, by print and Craigslist advertisements, promoting ""hot girls"", $1 beer, and $5 admission. Approximately 1,500 people attended the event and were greeted by signs that informed them that they were being filmed. No mobile phones, video, or cameras were allowed inside. The acts taking place became homosexual in nature, with Brüno inviting a man up to fight him, who turned out to be Lutz. Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" started to play as both men began kissing and stripping. The audience reacted violently and threw chairs and beer at the performers. The performers were Brüno (Baron Cohen) under the ironic gimmick, ""Straight Dave"", and Gustaf Hammarsten portraying his opponent, Lutz. In July 2008, Tyler, Texas television station KETK-TV was approached by a ""documentary film-maker"" who was allowed to bring a crew to interview a few members of the staff, including news director Neal Barton and sports director Danny Elzner. They signed releases and expected to be talking about small-town news in the United States. Instead, the interviews conducted by the flamboyant Brüno character drifted towards the topic of homosexuality. In September 2008, video and photographs were released showing Baron Cohen (as Brüno) storming the catwalk with objects on his velcro outfit during an Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada fashion show in Milan (at which Paul McCartney also was present). Baron Cohen managed to walk down the runway for a few moments before lights were dimmed and security guards escorted him away. This occurred after Baron Cohen and his crew were allegedly stopped by security while attempting to enter back-stage at two other shows during Milan's fashion week. On 2 November 2008, Baron Cohen, dressed as Brüno, and his film crew were spotted at a Los Angeles rally that was in support of California's Proposition 8.  On 7 November 2008, while appearing as an extra in a scene for the NBC TV series ""Medium"", Baron Cohen interrupted a scene in character and was removed from the set. Production on the episode was shut down temporarily, though actor Miguel Sandoval, who was told that a cousin of NBC executive Ben Silverman would appear as an extra in the jury, has stated that he recognized Baron Cohen and played along, commenting, ""It's one thing for Borat to go into an antique store in Georgia or Alabama. For Brüno to go on a TV show, he's among insiders. Most people knew who he was."" The production team also deceived presidential candidate Ron Paul into being interviewed by Brüno by posing as an Austrian television reporter looking to question the congressman about economic issues. As soon as Brüno drops his trousers, the congressman storms out of the room. A spokeswoman for Paul commented on the incident. She said Baron Cohen's people were very deceptive in their tactics. At the time, he thought they were ""legitimate"" but later confessed to some concern. ""I'm familiar with his work, so you can imagine how I feel about it,"" he said. Jesse Benton, senior vice-president of Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty organization and former campaign spokesman for Paul, said Paul was not familiar with Baron Cohen's programme, ""Da Ali G Show"". ""If it's not on hard-core financial news, he doesn't follow it,"" Benton said. But, he added, ""It sounds like it's going to be pretty funny."" The scene filmed during a taping of ""The Richard Bey Show"", however, was staged, and Bey was in on the joke, as his daytime show went off the air in 1996. The audience, however, was not made aware of the truth of the production. Similarly unaware of the true nature of the production was Paula Abdul, who, during her interview scene in the film, sat atop a Mexican landscaper and was presented with food adorned upon a man lying down on a cart wearing nothing but a ""sock"" over his penis. Abdul told a radio interviewer that she was ""scarred"" by the incident. Baron Cohen suffered a severe reaction to hydrogen peroxide after bleaching his anus in preparation for the role of Brüno. Although the incident temporarily slowed the production of the film, he suffered no long-lasting injuries. Release. Though the film was originally slated for a May 15, 2009 release, the release was later moved to July 10, 2009. The film received an early release in Australia, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Iceland on July 8 and in Germany, Greece, Ireland, Serbia, Slovenia, Israel, and Bosnia and Herzegovina on July 9, 2009. The film was then released internationally on July 10. Promotion. In a staged publicity stunt at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno to present the award for Best Male Performer. Dressed as a winged angel wearing a jockstrap and white go-go boots, he was suspended on wires and flew over the audience towards the stage, but fell and landed on rapper Eminem, with his head in Eminem's lap and his buttocks in front of Eminem's face. Eminem shouted, ""Are you fucking serious?"" and, ""Get this motherfucker off me!"", Eminem and his entourage then walked out of the show and did not return. It was later revealed that Eminem and Baron Cohen had staged the incident, rehearsing it beforehand to make sure it went off without a hitch, and leaving Eminem laughing to himself in his hotel room about how the crowd was easily fooled. Ban in Ukraine. In Ukraine, the film was scheduled to premiere on July 23, but on July 14, the Minister of Culture and Tourism of Ukraine decided to ban the distribution and demonstration of the film in the country. The reason for the prohibition was that nine out of 14 experts of a commission of experts said the film contained ""obscene language, homosexual scenes, and other scenes of offensive nature never shown in Ukraine. The ""Vinnytsya Human Rights Group"" immediately expressed its anger with the ban. An unofficial premiere of the film in Kiev on July 22, 2009 was disrupted by a smoke bomb. Home media. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 17, 2009. Special features include deleted/alternate/extended scenes and an audio commentary by Sacha Baron Cohen and Larry Charles. Reception. Reviews. Among critics and the public, ""Brüno"" has received mixed to positive reviews, with general feelings about the film being not as strong as Baron Cohen's previous film, ""Borat"". However, reviews of the premiere screenings of ""Brüno"" were generally positive among audiences. Nick Curtis of the ""Evening Standard"" wrote that ""Brüno"" is ""funnier, more offensive, and more outrageous than Borat"". ""The Telegraph"" gave the film four stars out of four, saying ""impossible not to laugh and also praising Brüno's controversial style of comedy."" The BBC also gave the film a positive review, saying ""Brüno pushes the boundaries further than Borat ever did."" However, they also said that ""It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea"" due to the offensive nature of the film. Roger Ebert awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, and said ""Here is a film that is 82 minutes long and doesn't contain 30 boring seconds"", although he noted that the film's R rating was ""very, very hard"". Andy Lowe from ""Total Film"" gave it a lower review, giving it three stars out of five and calling it ""as phony and frustrating as it is funny... The clothes may be new and more fabulous, but the emperor seriously needs to go shopping."" Others felt it was not as good, feeling it would insult and offend the gay community: A. O. Scott of ""The New York Times"" wrote that the film shows ""that lampooning homophobia has become an acceptable, almost unavoidable form of homophobic humor,"" and called the film ""a lazy piece of work that panders more than it provokes."" ""At the Movies"" critic Ben Mankiewicz criticized the film for being too demeaning and playing on homosexual stereotypes. He later named ""Brüno"" the worst film at the halfway point of 2009. Metacritic gives ""Brüno"" an average score of 54, suggesting ""mixed or average reviews"". However, it currently holds a 67% ""fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is advertised as a ""Certified Fresh Pick"". For its opening weekend, it narrowly beat """" (in its second week of release) for the highest gross, in the lowest attended second-weekend-in-July in 18 years. Reception in Austria. While ""Borat"" was criticised in Kazakhstan, Austrians were generally positive about ""Brüno"". Others regarded the humour as ""pretty average"" and ""inoffensive to Austria."" Within the Austrian press, reactions have been generally mild and positive, although the film has also been labelled as ""repetitive"". Christian Fuchs, from the Austrian radio station FM4, writes that ""hidden beneath the hard-as-nails satirist Cohen, lies a humanist who enlightens."" However, the film has also met some opposition in Austria, due to its portrayal of homosexuality, and basing the portrayal of Austria on motifs such as Josef Fritzl and Hitler, even going as far as calling Mel Gibson ""der Führer"" as he pointed at the actor/director's photo in the film. Box office. ""Brüno"" opened with $30 million in its first weekend. It has made $136,933,838 worldwide of which $60,054,530 was from Canada and the United States. LGBT response. Some LGBT groups have criticised the character as perpetuating LGBT stereotypes while simultaneously enlightening institutionalised homophobia issues. ""Sacha Baron Cohen's well-meaning attempt at satire is problematic in many places and outright offensive in others,"" Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programs for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) told ""The New York Times"". Title. An alternative title for the film is Brüno: Delicious Journeys Through America for the Purpose of Making Heterosexual Males Visibly Uncomfortable in the Presence of a Gay Foreigner in a Mesh T-Shirt. It was initially a mock title proposed by Hollywood news and gossip blog Defamer and mistakenly reported as genuine by a number of sources of film information, including MovieTome, where it is still used in the search results, the ""Daily Star"", ""The Irish Times"", ""The Boston Globe"", and (although no longer) the Internet Movie Database. However, the official ""Brüno"" website lists the extended 'title' in its metadata. Ayman Abu Aita lawsuit and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. On December 2, 2009, it was reported that Ayman Abu Aita, who stated he was falsely portrayed as a terrorist in the film, is filing a lawsuit of $110 million in libel damages for defamation.  Ayman Abu Aita was identified in the film as a member of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. Abu Aita says that he was never a member of Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, though he identified as such in a 2002 Boston Globe article. Baron Cohen claims he set up a meeting with Abu Aita in the West Bank with the help of a CIA agent. According to the lawsuit, however, the interview with Abu Aita took place at a hotel chosen by Baron Cohen and located in a part of the West Bank that was under Israeli military control. The filing of the lawsuit was confirmed at a press conference on December 2, 2009. Included in the lawsuit are David Letterman, NBC Universal, CBS, Worldwide Pants, Gannett Company and Larry Charles. In November 2010, the lawsuit was dismissed in Washington D.C. Court so as to be refiled in the Supreme Court of New York. Baron Cohen has said he had to increase his security detail following death threats from the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade after the release of the film. The group was angered by the interview with Abu Aita in which he was linked with the group, an armed wing of the Fatah movement. In a statement to the media, Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade denied that Abu Aita was a member and threatened that they ""reserve the right to respond in the way we find suitable against this man (Baron Cohen)"" and that they feel the segment was ""a dirty use of our brother Ayman"". Motion Picture Association of America. On October 11, 2010, it was revealed that the Motion Picture Association of America's Classification and Rating Administration would specifically note in the future which films contained ""male nudity."" A spokesman said this was in direct response to parental concerns about the content of ""Brüno"". "
wikipedia-37190042," 2012 Lamma Island ferry collision  On 1 October 2012, at approximately 20:20 HKT, a ferry and another passenger vessel collided off Yung Shue Wan, Lamma Island, Hong Kong. The day was the National Day of the People's Republic of China, and one of the ships was headed for the commemorative firework display, scheduled to take place half an hour later. With 39 killed and 92 injured, the incident was the deadliest maritime disaster in Hong Kong since 1971. Background. The accident involved a Hong Kong & Kowloon Ferry-operated passenger ferry, the ""Sea Smooth"" (海泰號), and a Hongkong Electric Company-owned vessel, the ""Lamma IV"" (南丫四號), with 121 passengers and 3 crew members on board. The passenger ferry was travelling from Central to Yung Shue Wan, while the Hongkong Electric Company vessel was travelling from Lamma Island to Central. Passengers on the ""Lamma IV"" were on a one-day tour organised by the company, and were headed to Central for the fireworks display commemorating the National Day of the PRC, after a tour at the Lamma Power Station. Participants of the tour mostly joined as families, and as a result there were a number of children among the passengers. Accident. At approximately 20:20, the ""Sea Smooth"" crashed into the ""Lamma IV"" on the port side. The bow of the ""Sea Smooth"" hit the stern of the ""Lamma IV"", rupturing the ship's two watertight compartments and thereby allowing them to quickly fill with water. The ship soon capsized with the rear sinking into the sea. The vessel reportedly went down so quickly that more than 100 passengers were thrown into the water unprotected despite the abundance of life-vests on board. The ferry left the scene after the accident and continued on to Yung Shue Wan pier. The front of ""Sea Smooth"" was damaged and its captain was also sent to the local clinic after the accident, along with several passengers, for injuries. Casualties. A total of 39 people were killed in the accident, all from the ""Lamma IV"", 30 of whom were pronounced dead at the scene, while eight others were certified dead upon arrival at hospitals and one died in hospital on 5 October. 92 people on both vessels were injured, four of whom sustained severe injures. While the Hongkong Electric company claimed 124 people were on the ""Lamma IV"", police suspected that there might have been more on board as company employees were allowed to invite their own friends. As a result, the number of people missing remained unknown. Rescue efforts. An air-and-sea rescue effort was initiated. The Fire Services Department deployed 10 launches, including a diving support vessel and mobilised 350 officers, including fire and ambulance personnel and more than 60 ambulances (including ambulances from St John Ambulance and Auxiliary Medical Service). The injured were taken to five hospitals around Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government had requested help from the nearby Guangdong province to aid in search-and-rescue, but external resources were not deployed at all as domestic resources were seen as adequate by the rescue forces. Investigation. Initial speculations on the cause of the accident included speeding and overloading. However, witnesses on the ""Lamma IV"" claimed that the ship was cruising at a steady speed. Overloading was also ruled out as the vessel had a capacity of 200 passengers. Andy Tsang, the Commissioner of Police, stated that seven crew members of the vessels were arrested the day after the accident, for ""endangering people's lives at sea"". A commission of inquiry is to be formed to investigate the causes of the accident. The Commission of Inquiry into the Collision of Vessels near Lamma Island on 1 October 2012 was appointed by the Chief Executive in Council to inquire into the facts and circumstances leading to and surrounding the collision. The Commission of Inquiry submitted its report to the Chief Executive on 19 April 2013. The full report is available on the website of the Commission. Reactions. Hongkong Electric. On 2 October, the flags of Cheung Kong Group companies were all flown at half-mast at the Cheung Kong Center, headquarters of Hongkong Electric's parent company. Hongkong Electric confirmed that seven of the those who died were staff of the Company. HK Electric announced that families of each of the deceased would receive a HK$200,000 emergency relief. Li Ka Shing, who controls HK Electric, immediately returned to the city the next morning. It was announced that the Li Ka Shing Foundation would set aside a total of HK$30 million for victims and their families that would be in addition to the emergency relief already offered by HKE to the families of the deceased. Hong Kong Government. Three days of mourning were declared by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, starting on 4 October, during which the flag of Hong Kong was flown at half-mast on all government buildings. On 4 October, Leung, along with other government officials, observed three minutes of silence outside the Central Government Offices at 12:00. Schools and other public offices also observed a moment of silence. Condolence points were set up in each of the 18 districts during the mourning period. The government cancelled the 2013 National Day Fireworks as a result of the incident. Others. On 2 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron sent Chief Executive Leung his condolences. Catherine Ashton, High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, also expressed her sadness and sent her condolences through a spokesman. Controversies. The decision by the captain of the ""Sea Smooth"" to leave the scene sparked a heated debate, namely whether saving oneself, or risking oneself for the others has a high priority. At first, reports stated that the captain continued on to the pier out of passenger request and out of fear that the ""Sea Smooth"" herself might sink, but later reports also claimed that some passengers urged the captain to stop. In the few days following the accident, the captain had remained emotionally unstable even after being discharged from the hospital. After he was informed of the accident, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying immediately set out to the scene to oversee the rescue efforts. Some media suggested it was a ""political show"", and said that his presence might have actually slowed down the rescue. Leung was also criticised for his decision to ask for help from Mainland China through the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, despite the abundance of manpower and resources already in Hong Kong. Many saw this as increased influence and reliance on the Chinese government, a change from the previous Tsang administration. Also, despite Leung's clarification that no ship from Mainland China had been deployed in the rescue, on 3 October Mainland China's China News Service reported that ""95 people has been rescued by the professional Chinese rescue fleet"". The news agency later deleted the number rescued, but the report had not been fully withdrawn and the claim remained that Chinese ships had helped in the rescue. "

wikipedia-5142539," Muromonab-CD3  Muromonab-CD3 (trade name Orthoclone OKT3, marketed by Janssen-Cilag) is an immunosuppressant drug given to reduce acute rejection in patients with organ transplants. It is a monoclonal antibody targeted at the CD3 receptor, a membrane protein on the surface of T cells. It was the first monoclonal antibody to be approved for clinical use in humans. History. Muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986, making it the first monoclonal antibody to be approved anywhere as a drug for humans. In the European Communities, it was the first drug to be approved under the directive 87/22/EWG, a precursor of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) centralised approval system in the European Union. This process included an assessment by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP, now CHMP), and a subsequent approval by the national health agencies; in Germany, for example, in 1988 by the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Frankfurt. However, the manufacturer of Muromonab-CD3 has voluntarily withdrawn it from the United States market due to decreased utilization; current OKT3 supplies are expected to be exhausted by mid-2010. Indications. Muromonab-CD3 is approved for the therapy of acute, glucocorticoid-resistant rejection of allogeneic renal, heart and liver transplants. Unlike the monoclonal antibodies basiliximab and daclizumab, it is not approved for prophylaxis of transplant rejection, although a 1996 review has found it to be safe for that purpose. It has also been investigated for use in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pharmacodynamics and chemistry. T cells recognise antigens primarily via the T cell receptor. This receptor needs various co-receptors to function, one of which is CD3. The T cell receptor-CD3 complex transduces the signal for the T cell to proliferate and attack the antigen. Muromonab-CD3 is a murine (mouse) monoclonal IgG2a antibody which was created using hybridoma technology. It binds to the T cell receptor-CD3-complex (specifically the CD3 epsilon chain) on the surface of circulating T cells, initially leading to an activation, but subsequently inducing blockage and apoptosis of the T cells. This protects the transplant against the T cells. After application of muromonab-CD3, normal T cell function is said to be restored within a week. When administered for transplant induction, the drug is administered daily thereafter for up to 7 days. Newer monoclonal antibodies in development with the same mechanism of action include otelixizumab (also known as TRX4), teplizumab (also known as hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala) ), and visilizumab (with a tentative trade name of ""Nuvion""). They are being investigated for the treatment of other conditions like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and type 1 diabetes. Further development of teplizumab is uncertain, due to one-year data from a recent Phase III trial being ""disappointing"". Adverse effects. Especially during the first infusion, the binding of muromonab-CD3 to CD3 can activate T cells to release cytokines like tumor necrosis factor and interferon gamma. This cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, includes side effects like skin reactions, fatigue, fever, chills, myalgia, headaches, nausea and diarrhea, and could lead to life-threatening conditions like apnoea, cardiac arrest, and flash pulmonary edema. To minimize the risk of CRS and to offset some of the minor side effects patient experience, glucocorticoids (such as methylprednisolone), acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine are given before the infusion. Other adverse effects include leucopenia, as well as an increased risk for severe infections and malignancies typical of immunosuppressive therapies. Neurological side effects like aseptic meningitis and encephalopathy have been observed. Possibly, they are also caused by the T cell activation. Repeated application can result in tachyphylaxis (reduced effectiveness) due to the formation of anti-mouse antibodies in the patient, which accelerates elimination of the drug. It can also lead to an anaphylactic reaction against the mouse protein, which may be difficult to distinguish from a CRS. Contraindications. Except under special circumstances, the drug is contraindicated for patients with an allergy against mouse proteins, as well as patients with uncompensated heart failure, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or epilepsy. It should not be used during pregnancy or lactation. Etymology. Muromonab-CD3 was developed before the WHO nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies took effect, and consequently its name does not follow this convention. Instead, it is a contraction from """"mur""ine ""mon""oclonal ""a""nti""b""ody targeting ""CD3"""". "
wikipedia-4064181," Willys-Knight  Willys-Knight is an automobile that was produced between 1914 and 1933 by the Willys-Overland Company of Toledo, Ohio. John North Willys purchased the Edwards Motor Car Company of Long Island, New York, in 1913, moving the operation to Elyria, Ohio, where Willys owned the plant that had previously manufactured the Garford automobile. Production began with a four-cylinder model which was priced in the $2,500 price range. The Willys-Knight employed a Knight sleeve valve engine, generally four- and six-cylinder models. In 1915, Willys moved assembly of the Willys-Knight to Toledo, Ohio, but continued manufacturing the engines in Elyria. Willys-Knight introduced a sleeve-valve V8 in 1917, which was sold until 1919. Willys-Knight enjoyed a production run average of 50,000 cars per year after 1922. Willys also purchased Stearns-Knight of Cleveland, Ohio, which also used a sleeve valve Knight Engine, making that marque the crown jewel in his growing automotive empire. Willys-Knight production ended in November 1932 (model year 1933) when the company, in receivership, stopped building higher priced cars, and instead focused on the manufacture of the inexpensive but durable Willys 77.  Seven Willys-Knight vehicles including two large trucks and a touring car were used on the Martin and Osa Johnson photographic safari in the remotest areas of Africa. "

She received religious Islamic teachings in Persian at home. Career. Suraiya made her debut as a child artist in ""Usne Kya Socha"" (1937). She got a prominent role as a child artist with the help of her uncle Zahoor, who was then a popular villain actor. During a holiday from school in 1941, she accompanied him to Mohan Studios to see the shooting of the film ""Taj Mahal"" which was being directed by Nanubhai Vakil. Vakil noticed Suraiya and not having in his mind at that time any particular young girl to play the role of young Mumtaz Mahal in ""Taj mahal"", selected Suraiya to play that role. Music director Naushad once heard Suraiya's voice on All India Radio while she sang for a children's program, and chose her to sing as a 13 year old for Mehtaab in Kardar's film ""Sharda"" (1942). He was Suraiya’s mentor and she sang some of the best songs of her career under his baton. Later he gave hits after hits when Suraiya became full fledged singing star in ""Anmol Ghadi"" (1946), ""Dard"" (1947), ""Dillagi"" (1949) and ""Dastaan"" (1950). Naushad composed approximately 51 songs for Suraiya, coming at 2nd place after Husnlal Bhagatram for composing the highest number of songs for Suraiya. As an adult, Suraiya initially played secondary roles in K. Asif's ""Phool"" (1944), Mehboob Khan's ""Anmol Ghadi"" (1946), which was written by Aghajani Kashmeri also Kashmiri, and ""Dard"" (1947). She got a break as a heroine for the film ""Tadbir"" (1945) at the recommendation of K. L. Saigal, who liked her voice during a rehearsal. She went on to costar with Saigal in ""Omar Khayyam"" (1946) and ""Parwana"" (1947). Although by then she had a couple of hit songs, but the four solo songs which she sang in ""Parwana"" made her a genuine singer star. She considered Composer of these songs, Khawaja Khurshid Anwar as her favorite Music Director for whom she sang just thirteen songs during 1943 to 1949. More opportunities arose for Suraiya after reigning actresses Noor Jehan and Khursheed Bano migrated to Pakistan following the 1947 partition of British India.  As an actress, Suraiya had an edge over her contemporaries Kamini Kaushal and Nargis because she could sing her own songs. After three hits ""Pyar ki jeet"" (1948), ""Badi Behen"", and ""Dillagi"" (1949), she became the highest paid female star. But her reign at the top was brief; her films started flopping in the 1950s. She made a comeback in ""Waaris"" and ""Mirza Ghalib"" (1954). ""Rustom Sohrab"" (1963) was her last film. In the late 1940s, she worked with Dev Anand. While shooting during the film Vidya, she became romantically involved with Dev Anand. The two of them were paired in seven films together: Vidya (1948), Jeet (1949), Shair (1949), Afsar (1950), Nili (1950), Do Sitare (1951) and Sanam (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Anand. She fell in love with him during the shooting of the song Kinare kinare chale jayen ge from the film Vidya—while shooting the scene, the boat they were in capsized, and Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. Their entire affair was conducted in a clandestine manner, with friends like Durga Khote and Kamini Kaushal going out of their way to engineer secret rendezvous. On the sets of the film Jeet, Anand finally proposed to Suraiya and gave her a diamond ring worth Rs 3,000. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship as they were Muslim and Anand was Hindu, and so, Suraiya remained unmarried. They stopped acting together after her grandmother opposed their partnership. Personal life. Suraiya was romantically involved with actor Dev Anand. The two of them costarred in six films between 1948 and 1951. During the shooting of the song ""Kinare kinare chale jayen ge"" of the film ""Vidya"" in 1948, a boat capsized and Dev Anand saved Suraiya from drowning.  Suraiya lived in her apartment Krishna Mahal Marine Drive in Mumbai until her death due to cancer in 2004 at age 74. She was interred at Badakabarastan in Marine Lines, Mumbai. Suraiya was declared the first Melody Queen (""Malika-e-Tarannum"") in the sub-continent and much later Noor Jehan was awarded with the same title. Her greatness can be judged by these comments. ""You have put life in the soul of ‘Mirza Ghalib’"", were the remarks of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Indian Prime Minister. The Hollywood legend Gregory Peck was keen to meet Suraiya. In connection with the shooting of some film he happened to visit Mumbai where he was honoured by the great actress by meeting him. "
wikipedia-372447," Raja  ""For other uses, see Raja (disambiguation) and Rajah (disambiguation)."" Raja (also spelled rajah, from Sanskrit ') is a term for a monarch or princely ruler. The female form, the word for ""queen"", mainly used for a raja's wife, is rani (sometimes spelled ranee), from Sanskrit ', or ratu, dato, datuk, or datu in Southeast Asia. The title has a long history in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, being attested from the Rigveda, where a """" is a ruler, see for example the (""), the ""battle of ten kings"". Etymology. Sanskrit ' is cognate to Latin ""rēx"" (genitive ""rēgis""), Gaulish ""rīx"", Gaelic ""rí"" (genitive ""ríg""), etc., originally denoting heads of petty kingdoms and city states. It is believed to be ultimately derived from a PIE ', a vrddhi formation to the root ' ""to straighten, to order, to rule"". The Sanskrit ""n""-stem is secondary in the male title, apparently adapted from the female counterpart ' which also has an ""-n-"" suffix in related languages, compare Old Irish ""rígain"" and Latin ""regina"". Cognates of the word ""Raja"" in other Indo-European languages include English ""reign"" and German ""reich"". www.dlis.du.ac.in Rather common variants in Rajasthani, Marathi and Hindi, used for the same royal rank in parts of India include Rana, Rao, Raol, Rawal and Rawat. Raja, the top title Thakore and many variations, compounds and derivations including either of these were used in and around South Asia by most Sinhalese Hindu, Muslim and some Buddhist and Sikh rulers, while Muslims also used Nawab or Sultan, and still is commonly used in India. Raja රජ the title means King in Sri Lanka and has entire power an island wide. Rajamanthri රාජමන්ත්රී is the Prince රජ කුමරැ lineage of King's generation in Sri Lanka. Rajamanthri title is aristocracy of the Kandiyan Kingdom මහනුවර in Sri Lanka. In Pakistan, Raja is still used by Muslim Rajput clans as hereditary titles. ""Raja"" is also used as a given name by Hindus and Sikhs. Most notably Raja is used in Hazara division of Pakistan for the descendants of Turk dynasty. These Rajas ruled that part of Pakistan for decades and they still possess huge land in Hazara division of Pakistan and actively participate in the politics of the region. Rajadharma. Rajadharma is the dharma which applies to the king, or the Raja. Dharma is that which upholds, supports, or maintains the order of the universe and is based on truth. It is of central importance in achieving order and balance within the world and does this by demanding certain necessary behaviors from people. The king served two main functions as the Raja: Secular and Religious. The religious functions involved certain acts for propitiating gods, removing dangers, and guarding dharma, among other things. The secular functions involved helping prosperity (such as during times of famine), dealing out even-handed justice, and protecting people and their property. Protection of his subjects was seen as the first and foremost duty of the king. This was achieved by punishing internal aggression, such as thieves among his people, and meeting external aggression, such as attacks by foreign entities. Moreover, the king possessed executive, judicial, and legislative dharmas, which he was responsible for carrying out. If he did so wisely, the king believed that he would be rewarded by reaching the pinnacle of the abode of the sun, or heaven. However, if the king carried out his office poorly, he feared that he would suffer hell or be struck down by a deity. As scholar Charles Drekmeier notes, ""dharma stood above the king, and his failure to preserve it must accordingly have disastrous consequences"". Because the king's power had to be employed subject to the requirements of the various castes' dharma, failure to ""enforce the code"" transferred guilt on to the ruler, and according to Drekmeier some texts went so far as to justify revolt against a ruler who abused his power or inadequately performed his dharma. In other words, Danda as both the king's tool of coercion and power, yet also his potential downfall, ""was a two-edged sword"". The executive duty of the king was primarily to carry out punishment, or Danda (Hindu Punishment). For instance, a judge who would give an incorrect verdict out of passion, ignorance, or greed is not worthy of the office, and the king should punish him harshly. Another executive dharma of the king is correcting the behavior of brahmanas that have strayed from their dharma, or duties, through the use of strict punishment. These two examples demonstrated how the king was responsible for enforcing the dharmas of his subjects, but also was in charge of enforcing rulings in more civil disputes. Such as if a man is able to repay a creditor but does not do so out of mean-spiritedness, the king should make him pay the money and take five percent for himself. The judicial duty of the king was deciding any disputes that arose in his kingdom and any conflicts that arose between dharmasastra and practices at the time or between dharmasastra and any secular transactions. When he took the judgment seat, the king was to abandon all selfishness and be neutral to all things. The king would hear cases, such as thefts, and would use dharma to come to a decision. He was also responsible for making sure that the witnesses were honest and truthful by way of testing them. If the king conducted these trials according to dharma, he would be rewarded with wealth, fame, respect, and an eternal place in heaven, among other things. However, not all cases fell upon the shoulders of the king. It was also the king's duty to appoint judges that would decide cases with the same integrity as the king. The king also had a legislative duty, which was utilized when he would enact different decrees, such as announcing a festival or a day of rest for the kingdom. Rajadharma largely portrayed the king as an administrator above all else. The main purpose for the king executing punishment, or danda, was to ensure that all of his subjects were carrying out their own particular dharmas. For this reason, rajadharma was often seen as the root of all dharma and was the highest goal. The whole purpose of the king was to make everything and everyone prosper. If they were not prospering, the king was not fulfilling his dharma. He had to carry out his duties as laid down in the science of government and ""not act at his sweet will."" Indeed, in the major writings on dharma (i.e. dharmasastra, etc.), the dharma of the king was regarded as the ""capstone"" of the other castes' dharma both due to the king's goal of securing the happiness and prosperity of his people as well as his ability to act as the ""guarantor"" of the whole social structure through the enforcement of Danda (Hindu Punishment).  In contemporary India, an idea pervades various levels of Hindu society: the ""Ramrajya"", or a kind of Hindu Golden Age in which through his strict adherence to rajadharma as outline in the Hindu epics and elsewhere, Rama serves as the ideal model of the perfect Hindu king. As Derrett put it, ""everyone lives at peace"" because ""everyone knows his place"" and could easily be forced into that place if necessary. Ram's actions with regards to his wife Sita at the end of the Ramayana arguably serve as the best example of his utmost regard for his dharma as king, although other actions of his both before and after his defeat of Ravana are equally revered.

wikipedia-1238476," Julio Arca  Julio Andrés Arca (born 31 January 1981 in Quilmes) is an Argentine footballer, he currently is a free agent after having his contract with Middlesbrough cancelled by mutual consent. Arca is also a former Argentina Under-20 captain. He is a left back or midfielder. An attack minded player, his key attributes include good long and short passing as well as hard work. Club career. Sunderland. Sunderland's manager, Peter Reid, signed Arca in 2000 from Argentinos Juniors with a £3.5 million five-year deal, while holding off competition from Newcastle United and Leeds United. He was an immediate success, scoring on his debut at the Stadium of Light against West Ham United. Peter Reid spotted him in an Under 21s match playing against England at Craven Cottage and tracked him until completing the signing in July 2000. Arca played for his previous club and national team at left back, but was successfully converted to left midfield by Reid. Arca was Reid's most expensive signing of that summer and was then second only behind Stefan Schwarz as the club's record buy. The youngster was tipped for the brightest of futures and full international honours in the near future. Arca scored three times for the Black Cats in his first season in the Premiership. However, like so many Sunderland players, Arca's 2001–02 campaign was disappointing as he was troubled by a series of niggling injuries. He did not manage to rediscover his form of the previous season, and was out of action from February. At the start of the 2002–03 campaign, Arca, who had then played 54 games for the club, stated his determination to get back to his best – both in fitness and form. He became a regular once again after Sunderland's relegation that season, and was arguably their best player as they returned to the Premiership under manager Mick McCarthy, winning the Football League Championship in 2004–05. Arca was also named in the PFA Team of the Year for First Division team in 2004 and Championship team in 2005. Sunderland were relegated in the 2005–06 season. As a result of relegation, Arca moved back to the Premiership joining North-East rivals Middlesbrough as a replacement for Franck Queudrue who moved to Fulham Middlesbrough. On 26 July 2006, Arca was Gareth Southgate's first senior player signing as manager of Middlesbrough, for a transfer fee of £1.75 million. He signed a five-year contract. Spanish club RCD Espanyol had also been interested in him. Arca played his first Premier League game for Middlesbrough against Reading on the opening day of the 2006-07 season. He broke his foot and was substituted at half-time for Andrew Davies. After regaining fitness he proved a revelation. With the progress of Andrew Taylor at left-back, Arca has been utilised as central attacking midfielder. His performances have earned rave reviews with many suggesting an international call-up would be just rewards. He scored his first goal for the club against Charlton in December 2006.. After that, Arca has established himself in the centre of the midfield. Some excellent performances, most notably in the 2–2 draw with Manchester United F.C. in the FA Cup, have led to speculation by the English press, that he could soon be awarded full international honours with Argentina. He is still liked strongly by most Sunderland fans despite moving to their local rivals, and in the 2007 Tees-Wear derby at the Riverside when he went off injured after scoring against them, he was cheered by the visiting Sunderland supporters. Unfortunately, following this injury Arca struggled to regain his excellent form in the months prior to it. In January 2008, Arca was named the new Middlesbrough captain by manager Gareth Southgate, replacing fellow midfielder George Boateng as skipper. His first game as captain was against Blackburn Rovers F.C. in the Premier League, the match ended 1–1. After only a few games leading the team he was replaced by Austrian left back Emanuel Pogatetz. Arca regained fine form towards the end of 2010, scoring in Middlesbrough's 2-1 win over Chesterfield in the League Cup and scoring his first league goal for over three years from a penalty kick, to give Middlesbrough a 1-0 victory over Cardiff. He scored his second of the season against Hull City, and later that week, he scored his third of the campaign on a 2-1 win over Coventry City. His contract ended at the end of the 2010-2011 season, in which he was voted the club's Player of the Year by both the fans and his team-mates. Arca re-signed with a two-year contract on 12 August 2011. Two days after signing the contract, Arca came on as a substitute in an away league match at Leeds United and passed to Marvin Emnes to score the only goal of the game. International career. Arca was the captain of the Argentina Youth Team which featured players like Javier Saviola, Nicolás Burdisso and Maxi Rodríguez in the same squad. After his successful first season in the Premier League with Sunderland, Arca captained the Argentina Under-20 team which won the FIFA U-20 World Cup tournament in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They beat the Ghana U-20 team 3-0 in the final to win their fourth title. "

wikipedia-20820474," CAF 5-Year Ranking  The Confederation of African Football football CAF 5-Year Ranking is used to determine the number of clubs that each CAF member association may enter in the region's club competitions. At present, those associations ranked in the top twelve (or tied for twelfth) may enter two sides into each of the two continental tournaments, while the remaining associations are limited to a single side in each competition. Introduction of the ranking. Prior to 2004, CAF organised three club tournaments (the CAF Champions League, the African Cup Winners' Cup, and the CAF Cup) with each association allowed to enter a single side in each tournament. Starting from the 2004 season, the Cup Winners' Cup and CAF Cup were combined into a new tournament, the CAF Confederation Cup. Rather than limiting all associations to just two positions in CAF tournaments, CAF decided to allow the leading nations two entries into the new tournament, and also allow them a second entry in the Champions League. As with the UEFA ranking used for their club tournaments, the CAF ranking is based on the results obtained in each of the past five completed club seasons (each weighted equally). There are some differences, notably: The initial ranking system. The initial classification (for 2004 tournaments) was made according to the performance of the associations in the previous 5 years (1998 to 2002) in club competitions held by the Confederation of African Football. According to this system the associations selected were Tunisia (36 points), Egypt (31 points), Côte d'Ivoire (27 points), Morocco (24 points), South Africa (17 points), Algeria (17 points), Cameroon (14 points), Ghana (12 points), Angola (12 points), Nigeria (10 points), Congo DR (8 points), and Senegal (6 points). Season 2005 controversy. In July 2004 the Confederation of African Football informed its members that the ranking system for admission to the various cups for the 2005 season would be done according to the same 1998-2002 ranking used for the 2004 season. It is unknown why CAF did not calculate a 1999-2003 ranking (following UEFA's practice of updating its rankings each season), as there would seem to have been enough time to do this. Since then, it has become CAF's policy to adopt a year older ranking for the competitions of the new season. So, for the 2012 season, rankings were based on results from 2006 to 2010. Season 2011 change. In December 2010 CAF altered the ranking system, removing the components from the Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, and weighting more recent results more highly. For 2011 competitions, results from seasons 2005 to 2009 were still used, but the points from 2009 were multiplied by 5, from 2008 by 4 and so on.  Criteria for awarding points. CAF approved its basic criteria, based on the criteria used in the election of the CAF Clubs of the 20th Century on 2000, for awarding points in 2003. Since then the only change (added in 2005) has been the addition of criteria that rewards clubs that advance to the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup. This methodology has also been used to create an all-time ranking for CAF clubs (adding the points that would have been obtained by each club based on its results since 1965). The table below shows the years during which the tournament was run (although for the CAF 5-year rankings only results since 1998 have counted). Since 2011 the Super Cup and FIFA World Cup Club have been excluded. Rankings. Legend Ranking for 2011 CAF Competitions. Ranking for 2011 CAF Competitions was based on results from the Champions League and Confederation Cup tournaments from 2005 to 2009. Associations in green were entitled to enter two teams in each of the CAF Champions League and the CAF Confederation Cup, although Zimbabwe only entered a single side in the Confederation Cup and Morocco had three entries to that competition. All other nations were only allowed to enter a single team in each. The published rankings from CAF showed different totals to those shown here - namely Tunisia 96, Egypt 87, Sudan 54, Côte d'Ivoire 18. Ranking for 2012 CAF Competitions. Ranking for 2012 CAF Competitions was based on results from the Champions League and Confederation Cup tournaments from 2006 to 2010. Associations in green were entitled to enter two teams in each of the CAF Champions League and the CAF Confederation Cup, although Libya did not enter either competition and there was only a single entrant to the Confederation Cup from both Egypt and Algeria. All other nations were only allowed to enter a single team in each. CAF did not publish any tiebreaking criteria, but Côte d'Ivoire received two entries in each of the 2012 tournaments, with only a single team from each of Angola and Zambia appearing in each. Provisional ranking for 2013 CAF Competitions. Ranking for 2013 CAF Competitions is based on results from the Champions League and Confederation Cup tournaments from 2007 to 2011. These tournaments concluded on 5 December 2011 with the final of the 2011 CAF Confederation Cup. The following shows the provisional ranking for 2013. The ranking may change as the published rankings from CAF in 2011 showed different totals. Associations above the green line are entitled to enter two teams in each of the CAF Champions League and the CAF Confederation Cup. All other nations may only enter a single team in each. Those associations shaded green should receive the larger allocations based on past practice. As CAF has not published any tiebreaking criteria, it is not possible to determine which of the associations shaded in blue would receive additional spots. Provisional ranking for 2014 CAF Competitions. Ranking for 2014 CAF Competitions is based on results from the Champions League and Confederation Cup tournaments from 2008 to 2012. These tournaments concluded on 25 November 2012 with the final of the 2012 CAF Confederation Cup. The following shows the provisional ranking for 2014.

wikipedia-208750," Tubeway Army  Tubeway Army were a London-based punk rock and new wave band led by lead singer Gary Numan. They were the first band of the post-punk era to have a synthesizer-based hit, with their single ""Are 'Friends' Electric?"" and its parent album ""Replicas"" both topping the UK Album Chart in mid-1979. ""Are 'Friends' Electric?"" was also the only song released by Tubeway Army to be a hit single, making the band technically a one-hit wonder; however, the success of Gary Numan often overshadows the band, leaving them off most one-hit lists. History. Aged 19 years, Gary Webb had fronted London band Mean Street in 1976 (their song ""Bunch of Stiffs"" appeared on the ""Live at the Vortex"" compilation, and was the B-side of the ""Vortex"" 7""). Leaving this band acrimoniously, he auditioned as lead guitarist for another band called The Lasers, where he met bass-player Paul Gardiner. The pair left The Lasers soon after and formed Tubeway Army, initially with Webb's uncle Jess Lidyard on drums. Webb rechristened himself ""Valerian"", Gardiner ""Scarlett"" and Lidyard ""Rael"". Webb was a prolific song-writer and ambitious for commercial success. The band began playing gigs on the punk scene in London and managed to secure a record deal with the independent Beggars Banquet label. They released two guitar-heavy, punk-style singles in the first half of 1978 (""That's Too Bad""/""Oh! Didn't I Say"", and ""Bombers""/""Blue Eyes""/""OD Receiver""). These failed to chart. Soon afterwards, the ""Tubeway Army"" album was released on blue vinyl, at which point Webb adopted the name ""Gary Numan"". Allegedly, Numan actually took his new pseudonym from a local Yellow Pages where a plumber called ""Arthur Neumann"" was listed, the singer abandoning the German spelling, to become Numan. Whilst still largely guitar/bass/drums-based, the album saw his first tentative use of the Minimoog synthesizer, which he had come across by accident in the recording studio during the album sessions. Lyrically the record touched on dystopian and sci-fi themes similar to those employed by authors such as Philip K. Dick, of whom Numan was a fan (the opening lines of the song ""Listen to the Sirens"" are a direct lift from the title of Dick's book ""Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said""). Whilst the album's modest initial pressing (which included a large batch of warped editions) sold out, it did not enter the album charts at that time, and no singles were lifted from it. By this time Tubeway Army had decided to abandon live shows – Numan was unhappy with pub-venue gigs on the often violent London punk scene (the only known recording of a Tubeway Army concert – a London show from February 1978 – was released as a bootleg album in the early 1980s. It was later officially included under the title ""Living Ornaments '78"" as bonus tracks on the 1998 CD re-release of the ""Tubeway Army"" album). Following swiftly on in early 1979, excited by the possibilities of synthesizers, Numan took Tubeway Army back into the studio to record a follow-up album, ""Replicas"". The result was more synth and science fiction orientated than the last album. The first single from the album, the bleak, slow-paced keyboard-driven song ""Down in the Park"", failed to chart. However, the next single, ""Are 'Friends' Electric?"" was more successful. A special picture-disc helped boost sales but what particularly grabbed the British public's imagination was Tubeway Army's appearance on the BBC show ""The Old Grey Whistle Test"", followed soon after by a slot on ""Top of the Pops"". The band appeared all dressed in black and near-motionless, Numan in particular giving a performance often referred to as being ""like an android"" (a style that was later reported to have been a means of covering stage nerves but which then became his trademark). The single climbed steadily to stay at number one in the UK charts for 4 weeks, with ""Replicas"" following suit in the album charts. With Tubeway Army still avoiding live shows, Numan recruited some additional musicians to make these television appearances (see above). Numan became the first synth-based artist in Britain to break through into major commercial success. At this point, he dropped the Tubeway Army name and subsequent releases were made under the artist name Gary Numan. Line-up. The only constant members were: Other musicians included: Numan was the driving force of the band, writing the material and producing the recordings. Subsequent albums were issued under his own name once the album ""Replicas"" became successful. Gardiner, Sharpley, and Payne continued as his backing band for some years. Gardiner died from a drug overdose in February 1984. Numan's personal tribute to his former cohort was the song ""A Child with the Ghost"", on the album ""Berserker"" (1984). Ced Sharpley born Cedric Sharpley, 31 December 1952; died from a heart attack on 13 March 2012. Discography. Studio albums. 1 The demos were recorded in 1978 but not released until 1984. Beggars Banquet have re-released and re-mastered these recordings numerous times. Current CD editions supplement the original album tracks with all single A- and B-sides, 12"" bonus tracks, studio out-takes, and recovered bootleg live material. "
wikipedia-9575279," Brand engagement  Brand engagement is a term loosely used to describe the process of forming an attachment (emotional and rational) between a person and a brand. It comprises one aspect of brand management. What makes the topic complex is that brand engagement is partly created by institutions and organizations, but is equally created by the perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of those with whom these institutions and organizations are communicating or engaging with.  There is still lack of clarity and debate about whether this is a “soft” or hard measure, and whether it can be linked to any consumer or employee behavior change – e.g. sales activity, trial, or recommendation. External. Brand engagement between a brand and its consumers/potential consumers is a key objective of a brand marketing effort. In general, the ways a brand connects to its consumer is via a range of ""touchpoints"" -- that is, a sequence or list of potential ways the brand makes contact with the individual. Examples include retail environments, advertising, word of mouth, online, and the product/service itself. Internal (""close stakeholder""). There are two broad areas where brand engagement is relevant within an organization (employees and close stakeholders such as franchise staff, call centers, suppliers or intermediaries). The first area is ensuring that the employer brand promised to employees is delivered upon once employees join the firm. If the employee experience is not what is promised, this could result in increased employee turnover and/or decreased performance. The second area is ensuring employees and close stakeholders of an organization completely understand the organization's brand, and what it stands for—and to make sure that their activities on a day to day basis are contributing to expressing that brand through the customer experience. In general, this requires an ongoing effort on the part of the organization to ensure that its employees and close stakeholders understand what the brand is promising to its customers, and to help all employees clearly understand how their actions and behaviors, on a day to day basis, either support or undermine the effort.  This often raises the issue of the value of investment in ""brand engagement."" It is a discretionary expense on the part of the organization. Proponents of brand engagement would argue that this is an investment—that is, the benefits to the organization outweigh the cost of the program. Within any organization there is competition for resources, so there is a significant need to demonstrate return on investment in employee engagement/internal communications. While it is generally accepted that it is important for internal communications professionals to demonstrate the value this function delivers to the organization, it is difficult to place a discrete figure on this contribution.  Best practice in internal communications generally adheres to certain principles: An aspect of internal brand engagement is brand orientation which refers to ""the degree to which the organization values brands and its practices are oriented towards building brand capabilities."" Thought leaders are increasingly placing employee engagement at the forefront of the fight for greater authenticity in the workplace, increased employee satisfaction and ultimately greater retention and improved customer service. They are passionate about the link to bottom line benefits and strongly advocate working on brands from the inside out. There are a range of experts and service providers who have created offers to bring the brand to life—all agree that the employee side of the equation is far more important than has been historically acknowledged.  Brand engagement among employees is, according to experts, becoming increasingly important as the speed and volume of customer word of mouth is greater than ever. Several major brands - including United Airlines, Comcast, and FedEx - have seen negative customer experiences spark viral videos that are seen by millions of people. Building an understanding of the brand among employees is seen as a way to avoid these incidents and, within this environment, as a way to drive positive reviews and word of mouth.  The measurement angle. Much internal communication and employee engagement practice is based on measurement of effectiveness or business contribution. The key elements in creating a model of employee engagement is the measurement of ""engagement drivers"" -- that is, what are the factors or combinations of factors which have an impact on productivity and commitment and can be monitored and addressed through people, process or technology changes? Many of the “engagement drivers” currently in use internally are HR focused, and in many cases do not delve deeply into the employee’s role in delivering the brand/customer experience as a distinct element. Example. Probably the most compelling example of this is the service-profit chain. The first real case study of this appeared in ""The Service Profit Chain"" (the so-called Sears Model, Harvard Business Review, 1997). This statistical model tracks increases in employee “engagement drivers” to correlated increases in customer satisfaction and loyalty, and then correlates this to increases in total shareholder return (TSR), revenue and other financial performance measures.  Since the service-profit chain emerged, it’s been developed, and criticized, but the general consensus is that employee engagement can contribute roughly 20% to an organization’s TSR (various Vivaldi, Watson Wyatt, Towers Perrin studies 2004, 2005, 2006). Collaboration and connectivity vs. content management. While some organizations are realizing the benefits of collaboration and work flow online, there appears to be significant focus on publishing and managing content, generally via content management systems. There is an emerging school of thought that organizational perspectives on technology are frequently misaligned with the actual requirements and desires of the users of the technology. That is, the nature (or intention) of a technology may not always determine the nature of its use – the telephone, for example, was originally intended as a broadcast medium . Its designers were focused on delivering content, while its users sought – and still value – connectivity(1). The social media phenomenon presents emerging evidence that this quest for connectivity is rapidly becoming a core focus of communication technology within organizations. This potentially creates a disconnect with more traditional content-driven models of internal communication—delivering (or making easily available) the right content at the right time to the right people using the right media. Therefore, there could be a great deal of potential within organisations, using their existing technologies, to derive cultural and performance benefits from re-thinking how they communicate, make decisions and work virtually.

wikipedia-7537925," Don't Say No  ""Don't Say No"" was the second album by Billy Squier, released on April 13, 1981. It was one of Squier's biggest albums, including the hits ""In the Dark"", ""Lonely Is the Night"", ""My Kinda Lover"" and ""The Stroke"". The album peaked at #5 on the ""Billboard"" album chart, and it remained on those charts for 111 weeks. ""The Stroke"" was the first single, reaching #17 on the Hot 100, and an even bigger hit at rock radio, hitting #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song even dented the British pop charts, rising to #52. The video for ""The Stroke"" — as most of the videos from both ""Don't Say No"" and its follow-up, ""Emotions In Motion"" — is a straight-ahead performance piece, featuring Squier on an arena stage. Squier's videos were staples on the then brand-new channel known as MTV which brought him more popularity. ""In The Dark"" followed ""The Stroke"" into the Top 40 on the pop chart, and the Top 10 at rock radio. ""Lonely Is The Night"" was released only to rock radio, where it hit #28 nationally. The fourth single was ""My Kinda Lover"", which narrowly missed the pop Top 40 and peaked at #31 at rock radio. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA for 500,000 sales in July 1981 and Platinum two months later.

wikipedia-215371," FBI Academy  The FBI Academy, located on Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia, is the training site for new Special Agents of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was first opened for use in 1972 on 385 acres (1.6 km²) of woodland. It is a relatively small government academy, housing three dormitory buildings and associated facilities. Federal law enforcement officers from the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration undergo training courses here. FBI agents currently have a 20-week long training course. Facilities. The main training complex has three dormitory buildings, a dining hall, library, a classroom building, a Forensic Science Research and Training Center, a 1,000-seat auditorium, a chapel, administrative offices, a large gymnasium and outside track, along with a fully equipped garage. In addition to the main complex, there is a mock city known as Hogan's Alley, which consists of facades replicating a small town. The Hogan's Alley facades are primarily used for FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration New Agent Training, while behind the facades are fully functioning classrooms, audio-visual facilities, storage areas, and administrative and maintenance offices. Just beyond Hogan's Alley is a 1.1-mile pursuit driving/defensive driving training track. The extensive firearms training provided to all FBI/DEA and other law enforcement officers is conducted at the indoor firing range, the eight outdoor firing ranges, four skeet ranges, or the 200-yard rifle range. The FBI Academy is a secured facility and, as such, is not open to the public for tours. Units. The units that reside here are the ""Field and Police Training Unit"", ""Firearms Training Unit"", ""Forensic Science Research and Training Center"", ""Technology Services Unit"" (TSU), ""Investigative Training Unit"", ""Law Enforcement Communication Unit"", ""Leadership and Management Science Unit's"" (LSMU), ""Outreach and Communications Unit"" (OCU), ""Physical Training Unit"", ""New Agents' Training Unit"" (NATU), ""Practical Applications Unit"" (PAU), and the ""Investigative Computer Training Unit"" (ICTU). Most of these are ""training"" units for developing new field agents, but they are also used to help get other agents up to date on new techniques through in-service training. Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). The Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) is a component of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) that uses behavioral sciences to assist in criminal investigations. The mission of the NCAVC and the BAUs is to provide behavioral based investigative and/or operational support by applying case experience, research, and training to complex and time-sensitive crimes, typically involving acts or threats of violence. Technology Services Unit (TSU).

wikipedia-3483766," Kalalau Valley  The Kalalau Valley is located on the northwest side of the island of Kauai in the state of Hawaii. The valley is located in the Nā Pali Coast State Park and houses the beautiful Kalalau Beach. The Nā Pali Coast is very rugged and is inaccessible to automobiles. The only legal ways to access the valley are by kayak or by hiking the Kalalau Trail.  The valley is renowned for its natural beauty; it is surrounded by lush cliffs more than high. The valley bottom is broad and relatively flat, with an accessible region about long and wide. The abundant sun and rain provides an ideal environment for flora and fauna. Many native Hawaiians lived in the valley into the 20th century, farming taro from a vast complex of terraced fields. Today, its designation as a state park forbids anyone from residing there. Access to Kalalau Valley. Since the Nā Pali Coast is too steep for any motorized vehicles, all access to the valley is by boat or foot, with the exception of emergency helicopter landings. Kayaks are a popular way of visiting the valley, although sea conditions can make this dangerous during the winter. Hiking the Kalalau Trail is also popular, but the trail is about long, quite strenuous, and can be dangerous at parts. Access to the Kalalau Valley is controlled in the name of conservation. A limited number of permits are issued for camping in Kalalau Valley every year by the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). Anyone wishing to hike beyond Hanakāpīai valley must have a permit for staying in Kalalau Valley overnight. A total of sixty overnight permits are issued for each night. Permits must generally be sought as early as 6 months in advance of travel. The valley is visible from the Kōkee State Park, which is accessible by road from the west side of the island. It is rumored that there is a trail accessing the valley from Kōkee, however all possible routes appear to be very dangerous and some people are suspected to have fallen to their deaths trying to find them. Ecology. The valley is home to many rare species, including the endangered plant ""Dubautia kalalauensis"" which was named for the valley and is found nowhere else in the world. Other endemics include the endangered ""Schiedea attenuata"". Life in Kalalau Valley. The natural beauty and relative isolation are the major attractions of the valley. Legal campers stay in the designated camping area within roughly of the beach. There is a small waterfall in this area that is used for bathing and washing dishes.  At one end of the beach is a stream that is also used for fresh water. All the streams are contaminated with leptospirosis, a bacteria that is transmitted from the urine of infected rodents. It is transmitted from the water into open cuts or mucous membranes. Symptoms occur from 5 days to 2 weeks after exposure and include sudden onset of fever, body aches, malaise. Treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg twice day. It is recommended that you treat water with iodine, and the story that stomach acid kills the leptospirosis does not take into account the fact that the bacteria is contracted via the membranes of the mouth and throat. Residents. In spite of the efforts of the state of Hawaii, many people illegally hike the Kalalau Trail and even live in the valley. These long-term campers live the lifestyle of Naturalists and are suspected by some to cause serious harm to the ecological balance of the valley by their waste and propagation of introduced species.  Some of these inhabitants contribute to the health of the valley by collecting waste, practicing leave no trace ethics, and tending to the trails which require constant maintenance. These stewards of the Nā Pali believe that the valley can return to a state of self sufficiency with careful and sustainable use of the valley's abundant resources. Some of these people argue that since permits are only available for 5 nights, there is not enough time to fully enjoy the valley. It takes at least 1 day for the rigorous , leaving only 3 days to explore the valley and beaches. There are stories of people who hike in and decide to stay indefinitely, due to the beauty and serenity that they find in the Kalalau Valley. The residents of the valley sometimes come into conflict with authorities charged with enforcing the law. The DOCARE officials make biannual raids of the valley, sometimes slashing and burning camp sites and illegal farms. Visitors who do not have a permit are issued citations that require a court appearance and a fine of up to $500 for a first offense. Destruction of terraced gardens. The magnificent and historical terraced gardens in the Kalalau Valley are being threatened and destroyed by the introduced and invasive trees. These trees created an extensive underground root network which quickly invaded the traditional rock walls of the terraces. Also, since these trees are introduced species, they are not suitable for the heavy Pacific Ocean winds that frequent the valley on a daily basis. The trees then fall and topple the rock walls causing permanent damage. The origin of the trees is disputed. Some argue that they were planted by the DLNR after the Hawaiian people abandoned the valley and it was decided to turn the valley into a popular tourist destination. The DLNR felt that tourists would like a forested canopy instead of bare land which was previously used as cattle pasture and taro plots. However, others note that the last private owners of the valley, the Robinson family, likely planted some of the trees there to provide shade for cattle kept there after the Hawaiians left.  Still others contend that the terraces were initially destroyed by the Robinson's cattle after the last Hawaiians left the valley in the early 1900s. The foraging cattle destroyed many terraces causing heavy erosion. The DLNR drop-seeded Java Plum trees (""Syzygium cumini"") to prevent erosion of the valley's topsoil. The roots grow around the stone terraces and when they fall, dislodge the rocks. Helicopters. There is also concern among visitors that the use of helicopters in the area is disturbing. Helicopters cause noise pollution that can be heard for miles. After reaching the end of the trail, hikers expect a quiet place to reflect on the majesty of the Nā Pali. Instead, they are faced with constant helicopter buzz from sun up to sun down. Many helicopters fly below legal limitations to ""get a closer view."" This practice causes considerable disturbance to those wishing to enjoy the Nā Pali, and contributes to erosion of the land and rock fall. Management of Kalalau Valley. Since the valley is a part of the Nā Pali Coast State Park, the DLNR is responsible for its maintenance and preservation. Some have criticized the DLNR for their inability to manage the Nā Pali Coast, although others note that many Hawaii parks suffer from a chronic lack of funding. "
wikipedia-358019," WNYC  WNYC is a set of call letters shared by a pair of co-owned, non-profit, public radio stations located in New York City. WNYC (AM) broadcasts on the AM band at 820 kHz, and WNYC-FM is at 93.9 MHz. Both stations are members of NPR and carry distinct, but similar news/talk programs. The stations are known for their nationally syndicated news and culture programming and Internet radio broadcasts. WNYC reaches more than one million listeners each week and has the largest public radio audience in the United States. The WNYC stations are co-owned with Newark, New Jersey-licensed classical music outlet WQXR-FM (105.9 MHz), and all three broadcast from studios and offices in the TriBeCa section of Manhattan. WNYC's AM transmitter is located in Kearny, New Jersey, and WNYC-FM's transmitter is located on the Empire State Building in New York City. WNYC also owns and operates New Jersey Public Radio, a group of four northern New Jersey noncommercial FM stations acquired by WNYC from the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority on July 1, 2011. History. Early years. WNYC is one of the oldest radio stations in the United States. Funds for the establishment of the station were approved on June 2, 1922 by the New York City Board of Estimate and Apportionment. WNYC made its first official broadcast two years later on July 8, 1924, at 570 AM with a second-hand transmitter shipped from Brazil. With the commencement of WNYC's operations, the City of New York became one of the first American municipalities to be directly involved in broadcasting. In 1928 WNYC was forced into a time-sharing arrangement on 570 AM with WMCA, another pioneering New York radio outlet. This situation lasted until 1931, when the Federal Radio Commission (a forerunner to today's FCC) moved WNYC to 810 AM. The frequency move did not help WNYC from an operational standpoint as it now shared its frequency with the more-powerful WCCO in Minneapolis, over 1,200 miles to the west. WNYC was now limited to daytime-only operations, broadcasting from sunrise to sunset. Great Depression and World War II. WNYC's transmitter was moved in 1937 from the top of the Municipal Building to City-owned land at 10 Kent Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as part of a Works Progress Administration project. In 1938 the Municipal Broadcasting System was established by the City of New York to run the station. For its first 14 years, WNYC had been run by the New York City Commissioner for Bridges, Plant and Structures. Now, under an agency devoted singularly to its function and with the leadership of new director Morris S. Novik, appointed by Mayor LaGuardia, WNYC became a model public broadcaster. Among its many landmark programs was the annual ""American Music Festival"". In 1941 the North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement shifted WNYC's dial position a second time, to 830 kHz. WCCO was moved to 830 as well, and was given clear-channel authority. WNYC would remain a 1,000-watt, daytime-only outlet for the next 48 years (it actually broadcast until 11:00 pm, which was 10:00 pm in Minneapolis, for many of those years). Later that year, on December 7, WNYC was the first radio station in the United States to announce the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. WNYC began regularly scheduled broadcasts on the FM band March 13, 1943 at 43.9 megacycles. Known originally as W39NY, the FM outlet adopted its present WNYC-FM identity and its present frequency of 93.9 MHz within a few years. In 1961 the pair were joined by a television operation, as WUHF (channel 31) took the air in an experimental format. The following year the station was renamed WNYC-TV.  The Municipal Broadcasting System (which was renamed the WNYC Communications Group in 1989) helped to form National Public Radio in 1971, and the WNYC stations were among the 90 stations that carried the inaugural broadcast of ""All Things Considered"" later that year. In 1990 WNYC (AM) moved from 830 kHz to 820 kHz, commenced around-the-clock operations, and increased its daytime power to 10,000 watts while maintaining 1,000 watts at night, to protect WBAP in Fort Worth, Texas, which is much farther from New York City than Minneapolis. The Brooklyn transmitter site was decommissioned, and their AM signal moved to Belleville Turnpike in Kearny, New Jersey, sharing three towers with WMCA. [http://www.nyradioguide.com/cgi-bin/infoam.cgi/WNYC-AM] The station's ownership by the City meant that it was occasionally subject to the whims of various mayors. As part of a crackdown on prostitution in 1979, then-Mayor Ed Koch tried to use WNYC to broadcast the names of ""johns"" arrested for soliciting. Announcers threatened a walkout and station management refused to comply with the idea; after one broadcast the idea was abandoned. ""See John Hour."" Independence from the City. Shortly after assuming the mayoralty in 1994, Rudolph W. Giuliani announced he was considering selling the WNYC stations. Giuliani believed that broadcasting was no longer essential as a municipal entity, and that any financial compensation would be used to help the City cover budget shortfalls. The final decision was made in March 1995: While the City opted to divest WNYC-TV (now WPXN-TV) through a blind auction, WNYC-AM-FM was sold to the WNYC Foundation for $20 million over a six-year period–far less than what the stations could have been sold for if they were placed on the open market. While this potential sale put an end to the occasional political intrusions of the past, it required the WNYC Foundation to embark on a major appeal towards listeners, other foundations, and private benefactors. The station's audience and budget have since continued to grow since the split from the City. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 destroyed WNYC-FM's transmitter atop the World Trade Center. The station's studios, in the nearby Municipal Building, had to be evacuated and station staff was unable to return to its offices for three weeks. The FM signal was knocked off the air for a time. WNYC temporarily moved its offices to the studios at National Public Radio's New York bureau in midtown Manhattan, where it broadcast on its still operating AM signal transmitting from towers in Kearny, New Jersey and by a live Internet stream. The station eventually returned to the Municipal Building. Move to new studios. On June 16, 2008 WNYC moved from its of rent-free space scattered on eight floors of the Manhattan Municipal Building to a new location on Varick Street, near the Holland Tunnel. The station now occupies two and a half floors of a 12-story former printing building. The new offices have ceilings and of space. The number of recording studios and booths has doubled, to 31. There is a new 140-seat, street-level studio for live broadcasts, concerts and public forums and an expansion of the newsroom for a capacity of up to 40 journalists. In the Municipal Building, the journalists were not in a centralized newsroom, but scattered over many offices throughout the building. Renovation, construction, rent and operating costs for the new Varick Street location amounted to $45 million. In addition to raising these funds, WNYC has been raising money for a one-time fund of $12.5 million to cover the cost of creating 40 more hours of new programming and three new shows. The total cost of $57.5 million for both the move and programming is nearly three times the $20 million the station had to raise over seven years to buy its licenses from the City in 1997. Acquisition of WQXR. On October 8, 2009 WNYC took control of classical music station WQXR-FM. WQXR's intellectual property (call letters and format) was acquired from the New York Times Company as part of a three-way transaction with Univision Radio. WNYC also purchased the 105.9 FM frequency of Univision's WCAA (now WXNY-FM), and moved WQXR-FM there. The deal resulted in WQXR becoming a non-commercial educational station, and WNYC-FM dropped its remaining classical music programming to become a full-time news/talk station. New Jersey expansion. On June 6, 2011, the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority agreed to sell four FM stations in northern New Jersey to New York Public Radio. The transaction was announced by Governor Chris Christie, as part of his long-term goal to end State-subsidized public broadcasting. The four stations were previously the northern half of New Jersey Network's statewide radio service. Upon taking control of the four stations on July 1, 2011, they were rebranded as New Jersey Public Radio. Past personalities. Past WNYC radio personalities include H. V. Kaltenborn, who hosted radio's first quiz program on WNYC in 1926, the ""Brooklyn Daily Eagle""'s ""Current Events Bee"", a forerunner to shows like National Public Radio's ""Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!"" In its early years the station lacked funds for a record library and would borrow albums from record stores around the Manhattan Municipal Building, where its studios were located. Legend has it, a listener began lending classical records to the station and in 1929, WNYC began broadcast of ""Masterwork Hour"", radio's first program of recorded classical music. Following the U.S. entry into World War II, New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia made use of the station every Sunday in his ""Talk to the People"" program. Margaret Juntwait, an announcer and classical music host at WNYC for 15 years who left for the Metropolitan Opera in September 2006, is now the announcer for the Met's Saturday Afternoon Radio Broadcasts and is only the third regular announcer of the long-standing broadcast series launched in 1931, and is also the first woman to hold the position. John Schaefer, a music show host at WNYC for 20 years, has written liner notes for more than 100 albums, for everyone from Yo-Yo Ma to Terry Riley and was named a ""New York influential"" by ""New York Magazine"". Programming. WNYC produces 100 hours a week of its own programming, including nationally-syndicated shows like ""Studio 360"", ""On the Media"" and ""Radiolab"", as well as local news and interview shows that include ""The Leonard Lopate Show"", ""Soundcheck"" and ""The Brian Lehrer Show"". The entire schedule is streamed live over the internet (and several shows also air over XM Satellite Radio); as a result the station receives listener calls from far-flung states and even has international listeners. WNYC-FM offers a diverse format of NPR news and cultural programs, while WNYC-AM focuses mostly on news programming. WNYC has a local news team of 18 journalists. ""Studio 360"" is a weekly one-hour program about arts and culture hosted by Kurt Andersen, the former editor of ""Spy Magazine"". Taking current issues and trends as jumping-off points, the show explores a broad range of cultural ideas. Each program begins with a topical section of stories about the arts and culture from around the United States and around the world. ""On the Media"" is a weekly nationally-syndicated one-hour program hosted by Brooke Gladstone and Bob Garfield of Advertising Age covering the media and its effect on American culture and society. Many stories investigate how events of the past week were covered by the press. Stories also regularly cover such topics as video news releases, net neutrality, media consolidation, censorship, freedom of the press, spin, and how the media is changing with technology. ""The Brian Lehrer Show"" is a two-hour weekday talk show covering local and national current events and social issues hosted by Brian Lehrer, a former anchor and reporter for NBC Radio Network.

wikipedia-3342099," Silicone rubber  Silicone rubber is an elastomer (rubber-like material) composed of silicone—itself a polymer—containing silicon together with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Silicone rubbers are widely used in industry, and there are multiple formulations. Silicone rubbers are often one- or two-part polymers, and may contain fillers to improve properties or reduce cost. Silicone rubber is generally non-reactive, stable, and resistant to extreme environments and temperatures from -55 °C to +300 °C while still maintaining its useful properties. Due to these properties and its ease of manufacturing and shaping, silicone rubber can be found in a wide variety of products, including: automotive applications; cooking, baking, and food storage products; apparel such as undergarments, sportswear, and footwear; electronics; medical devices and implants; and in home repair and hardware with products such as silicone sealants. Curing. In its uncured state, silicone rubber is a highly-adhesive gel or liquid. In order to convert to a solid, it must be cured, vulcanized, or catalyzed. This is normally carried out in a two stage process at the point of manufacture into the desired shape, and then in a prolonged post-cure process. It can also be injection molded. Silicone rubber may be cured by a platinum-catalyzed cure system, a condensation cure system, a peroxide cure system, or an oxime cure system. Addition cure system. In a platinum-based system, also called an ""addition"" system (because platinum is ""added"" to the system as a catalyst and there are no byproducts) two separate components must be mixed to catalyze the polymers: the one component contains a platinum complex which must be mixed with the second, a hydride- and a vinyl-functional siloxane polymer, creating an ethyl bridge between the two. Such silicone rubbers cure quickly, though the rate of or even ability to cure is easily inhibited in the presence of elemental tin, sulphur, and many amine compounds. Dow Corning produced a product called Silastic Rx which is a platinum-cured tubing used in the medical industry. This platinum-based system has many merits, such as almost nil shrinkage(not more than 0.1%), high chemical resistance to aggressive components of some types of resins, good tear strength, high degree of precision in reproduction, high demensional stability over time and non-deformability, high resistance to high temperatures and aging, excellent non-stick effect and good grade(environmental, odorless and nontoxic). Condensation-based system. In a ""condensation"" system, also called an ""RTV"" (room-temperature vulcanizing) system, an alcoxy crosslinker exposed to ambient humidity (i.e., water) experiences a hydrolysis step and is left with a hydroxyl group. This group then participates in a condensation reaction with another hydroxyl group attached to the actual polymer. A tin catalyst is not necessary for the reaction to occur, though it increases the rate of the reaction and therefore decreases the cure time. No mixing is required for the reaction to take place. Such a system will cure on its own at room temperature and (unlike the platinum-based system) is not easily inhibited by contact with other chemicals, though it may take as long as a week for the system to fully cure. Acetoxy tin condensation is one of the oldest cure chemistries used for curing silicone rubber, and is the one used in household bathroom caulk. The smell of vinegar in the form of acetic acid is the usual indicator that the reaction is incomplete. Non-acid-producing formulations also exist which have a shorter shelf-life, however, and reduced adhesion when finally cured. Peroxide-based system. Saint-Gobain produces medical products made of what it calls Silmedic, a peroxide-based silicone. History. The first silicone elastomers were developed in the search for better insulating materials for electric motors and generators. Resin-impregnated glass fibers were the state-of-the-art materials at the time. The glass was very heat resistant, but the phenolic resins would not withstand the higher temperatures that were being encountered in new smaller electric motors. Chemists at Corning Glass and General Electric were investigating heat-resistant materials for use as resinous binders when they synthesized the first silicone polymers, demonstrated that they worked well and found a route to produce it commercially. The term ""silicone"" is actually a misnomer. The suffix ""-one"" is used by chemists to denote a substance with a double-bonded atom of oxygen in its backbone. When first discovered, silicone was erroneously believed to have oxygen atoms bonded in this way. In fact, silicone is an inorganic polymer, and the technically correct term for the various silicone rubbers is polysiloxanes or polydimethylsiloxanes. Corning Glass in a joint venture with Dow Chemical formed Dow Corning in 1943 to produce this new class of materials. As the unique properties of the new silicone products were studied in more detail, their potential for broader usage was envisioned, and GE opened its own plant to produce silicones in 1947. Wacker Chemie also started production of silicones in Europe in 1947. The Japanese company Shin-Etsu Chemical began mass production of silicone in 1953. The companies mentioned above are now still the main competitors in the oligopoly that comprises the silicone industry. Properties. Silicone rubber offers good resistance to extreme temperatures, being able to operate normally from -100 °C to +300 °C. Some properties such as elongation, creep, cyclic flexing, tear strength, compression set, dielectric strength(at high voltage), thermal conductivity, fire resistance and in some cases tensile strength can be—at extreme temperatures—far superior to organic rubbers in general, although a few of these properties are still lower than for some specialty materials. Silicone rubber is a material of choice in industry when retention of initial shape and mechanical strength are desired under heavy thermal stress or sub-zero temperatures. Organic rubber has a carbon-to-carbon backbone which can leave it susceptible to ozone, UV, heat and other ageing factors that silicone rubber can withstand well. This makes silicone rubber one of the elastomers of choice in many extreme environments. Silicone rubber is highly inert and does not react with most chemicals. Due to its inertness, it is used in many medical applications including medical implants. Structure. Polysiloxanes differ from other polymers in that their backbones consist of Si-O-Si units unlike many other polymers that contain carbon backbones. Polysiloxane is very flexible due to large bond angles and bond lengths when compared to those found in more basic polymers such as polyethylene. For example, a C-C backbone unit has a bond length of 1.54 Å and a bond angle of 112˚, whereas the siloxane backbone unit Si-O has a bond length of 1.63 Å and a bond angle of 130˚. The siloxane backbone differs greatly from the basic polyethylene backbone, yielding a much more flexible polymer. Because the bond lengths are longer, they can move farther and change conformation easily, making for a flexible material. Polysiloxanes also tend to be chemically inert, due to the strength of the silicon-oxygen bond. Despite silicon being a congener of carbon, silicon analogues of carbonaceous compounds generally exhibit different properties, due to the differences in electronic structure and electronegativity between the two elements; the silicon-oxygen bond in polysiloxanes is significantly more stable than the carbon-oxygen bond in polyoxymethylene (a structurally similar polymer) due to its higher bond energy. Special grades. There are many special grades and forms of silicone rubber, including: steam resistant, metal detectable, high tear strength, extreme high temperature, extreme low temperature, electrically conductive, chemical/oil/acid/gas resistant, low smoke emitting, and flame-retardant. A variety of fillers can be used in silicone rubber, although most are non-reinforcing and lower the tensile strength. Silicone rubber is available in a range or hardness levels, expressed as Shore A or IRHD between 10 and 100, the higher number being the harder compound. It is also available in virtually any colour, and can be colour matched. Applications. Once mixed and coloured, silicone rubber can be extruded into tubes, strips, solid cord or custom profiles according to the size specifications of the manufacturer. Cord can be joined to make O-rings and extruded profiles can be joined to make seals. Silicone rubber can be moulded into custom shapes and designs. Manufacturers work to set industry tolerances when extruding, cutting or joining silicone rubber profiles. In the UK this is BS3734, for extrusions the tightest level is E1 and the widest is E3. Becoming more and more common at the consumer level, silicone rubber products can be found in every room of a typical home. It is used in automotive applications, many cooking, baking, and food storage products, apparel including undergarments, sportswear, and footwear, electronics, to home repair and hardware, and a host of unseen applications. Freeze-tolerant solar water-heating panels exploit the elasticity of silicone to repeatedly accommodate the expansion of water on freezing, while its extreme temperature tolerance maintain a lack of brittleness below freezing and excellent tolerance of temperatures in excess of 150 °C. Its property of not having a carbon backbone, but a chemically robust silicon backbone instead, reduces its potential as a food source for dangerous waterborne bacteria such as Legionella. Non-dyed silicone rubber tape with an iron-oxide additive (making the tape a red-orange colour) is used extensively in aviation and aerospace wiring applications as a splice or wrapping tape due to its non-flammable nature. The iron-oxide additive adds high thermal conductivity but does not change the high electrical insulation property of the silicone rubber. This type of self-amalgamating tape amalgamates or fuses to itself, so that when stretched and wrapped around cables, electrical joints, hoses and pipes it bonds into a strong seamless rubbery electrically insulating and waterproof layer, although not adhesive. With the addition of carbon or another conductive substance as a powdered filler, silicone rubber can be made electrically conductive while retaining most of its other mechanical properties. As such it is used for flexible contacts which close on being pressed, used in many devices such as computer keyboards and remote control handsets. Self-healing. Recently, silicone rubber formed the matrix of the first autonomic self-healing elastomer. The microcapsule-based material was capable of recovering almost all of the original tear strength. Additionally, this material had improved fatigue properties as evaluated using a torsion-fatigue test. "
wikipedia-192108," Radio direction finder  A radio direction finder (RDF) is a device for finding the direction to a radio source. Due to low frequency propagation characteristic to travel very long distances and ""over the horizon"", it makes a particularly good navigation system for ships, small boats, and aircraft that might be some distance from their destination (see Radio navigation). The distinct technology ""Range and Direction Finding"" was the abbreviation used to describe the predecessor to radar. History. John Stone Stone patented the first direction finding system in 1902 (U.S. Patent 716,134). Alternate and improved direction finding systems were invented by Lee de Forest in 1904 (U.S. Patent 771,819), and by Italian engineers Ettore Bellini and Alessandro Tosi in 1909 (U.S. Patent 943,960). In 1919, British Army Officer Frank Adcock proposed an improved direction finding antenna design Adcock antenna (UK Patent 130,490). The US Army Air Corps in 1931 tested a primitive radio compass that used commercial stations as the beacon. Operation. ""Radio Direction Finding"" works by comparing the signal strength of a directional antenna pointing in different directions. At first, this system was used by land and marine-based radio operators, using a simple rotatable loop antenna linked to a degree indicator. This system was later adopted for both ships and aircraft, and was widely used in the 1930s and 1940s. On pre-World War II aircraft, RDF antennas are easy to identify as the circular loops mounted above or below the fuselage. Later loop antenna designs were enclosed in an aerodynamic, teardrop-shaped fairing. In ships and small boats, RDF receivers first employed large metal loop antennas, similar to aircraft, but usually mounted atop a portable battery-powered receiver. In use, the RDF operator would first tune the receiver to the correct frequency, then manually turn the loop, either listening or watching an S meter to determine the direction of the ""null"" (the direction at which a given signal is weakest) of a long wave (LW) or medium wave (AM) broadcast beacon or station (listening for the null is easier than listening for a peak signal, and normally produces a more accurate result). This null was symmetrical, and thus identified both the correct degree heading marked on the radio's compass rose as well as its 180-degree opposite. While this information provided a baseline from the station to the ship or aircraft, the navigator still needed to know beforehand if he was to the east or west of the station in order to avoid plotting a course 180-degrees in the wrong direction. By taking bearings to two or more broadcast stations and plotting the intersecting bearings, the navigator could locate the relative position of his ship or aircraft. Later, RDF sets were equipped with rotatable ferrite loopstick antennas, which made the sets more portable and less bulky. Some were later partially automated by means of a motorized antenna (ADF). A key breakthrough was the introduction of a secondary vertical whip or 'sense' antenna that substantiated the correct bearing and allowed the navigator to avoid plotting a bearings 180 degrees opposite the actual heading. After World War II, there many small and large firms making direction finding equipment for mariners, including Apelco, Aqua Guide, Bendix, Gladding (and its marine division, Pearce-Simpson), Ray Jefferson, Raytheon, and Sperry. By the 1960s, many of these radios were actually made by Japanese electronics manufacturers, such as Panasonic, Fuji Onkyo, and Koden Electronics Co., Ltd. In aircraft equipment, Bendix and Sperry-Rand were two of the larger manufacturers of RDF radios and navigation instruments. Usage in maritime and aircraft navigation. Radio transmitters for air and sea navigation are known as ""beacons"" and are the radio equivalent to a lighthouse. The transmitter sends a Morse Code transmission on a Long wave (150 – 400 kHz) or Medium wave (520 – 1720 kHz) frequency incorporating the station's identifier that is used to confirm the station and its operational status. Since these radio signals are broadcast in all directions (omnidirectional) during the day, the signal itself does not include direction information, and these beacons are therefore referred to as non-directional beacons, or NDBs. As the commercial medium wave broadcast band lies within the frequency capability of most RDF units, these stations and their transmitters can also be used for navigational fixes. While these commercial radio stations can be useful due to their high power and location near major cities, there may be several miles between the location of the station and its transmitter, which can reduce the accuracy of the 'fix' when approaching the broadcast city. A second factor is that some AM radio stations are omnidirectional during the day, and switch to a reduced power, directional signal at night. RDF was once the primary form of aircraft and marine navigation. Strings of beacons formed ""airways"" from airport to airport, while marine NDBs and commercial AM broadcast stations provided navigational assistance to small watercraft approaching a landfall. In the United States, commercial AM radio stations were required to broadcast their station identifier once per hour for use by pilots and mariners as an aid to navigation. In the 1950s, aviation NDBs were augmented by the VOR system, in which the direction to the beacon can be extracted from the signal itself, hence the distinction with non-directional beacons. Use of marine NDBs was largerly supplanted in North America by the development of LORAN in the 1970s. Today many NDBs have been decommissioned in favor of faster and far more accurate GPS navigational systems. However the low cost of ADF and RDF systems, and the continued existence of AM broadcast stations (as well as navigational beacons in countries outside North America) has allowed these devices to continue to function, primarily for use in small boats, as an adjunct or backup to GPS. Automatic direction finder (ADF). An automatic direction finder (ADF) is a marine or aircraft radio-navigation instrument that automatically and continuously displays the relative bearing from the ship or aircraft to a suitable radio station. ADF receivers are normally tuned to aviation or marine NDBs operating in the LW band between 190 – 535 kHz. Like RDF units, most ADF receivers can also receive medium wave (AM) broadcast stations, though as mentioned, these are less reliable for navigational purposes. The operator tunes the ADF receiver to the correct frequency and verifies the identity of the beacon by listening to the Morse code signal transmitted by the NDB. On marine ADF receivers, the motorized ferrite-bar antenna atop the unit (or remotely mounted on the masthead) would rotate and lock when reaching the null of the desired station. A centerline on the antenna unit moving atop a compass rose indicated in degrees the bearing of the station. On aviation ADFs, the unit automatically moves a compass-like pointer (RMI) to show the direction of the beacon. The pilot may use this pointer to ""home"" directly towards the beacon, or may also use the magnetic compass and calculate the direction from the beacon (the ""radial"") at which their aircraft is located. Unlike the RDF, the ADF operates without direct intervention, and continuously displays the direction of the tuned beacon. Initially, all ADF receivers, both marine and aircraft versions, contained a rotating loop or ferrite loopstick aerial driven by a motor which was controlled by the receiver. Like the RDF, a sense antenna verified the correct direction from its 180-degree opposite. More modern aviation ADFs contain a small array of fixed aerials and use electronic sensors to deduce the direction using the strength and phase of the signals from each aerial. The electronic sensors listen for the ""trough"" that occurs when the antenna is at right angles to the signal, and provide the heading to the station using a direction indicator. In flight, the ADF's RMI or direction indicator will always point to the broadcast station regardless of aircraft heading, however a banked attitude can have a slight effect on the reading, the needle will still generally indicate towards the beacon, however it suffers from DIP error where the needle dips down in the direction of the turn. Such receivers can be used to determine current position, track inbound and outbound flight path, and intercept a desired bearing. These procedures are also used to execute holding patterns and non-precision instrument approaches. Station passage. As an aircraft nears an NDB station, the ADF becomes increasingly sensitive, small lateral deviations result in large deflections of the needle which sometimes shows erratic left/right oscillations. Ideally, as the aircraft overflies the beacon, the needle swings rapidly from directly ahead to directly behind. This indicates ""station passage"" and provides an accurate position fix for the navigator. Less accurate station passage, passing slightly to one side or another, is shown by slower (but still rapid) swinging of the needle. The time interval from the first indications of station proximity to positive station passage varies with altitude — a few moments at low levels to several minutes at high altitude. Homing. The ADF may be used to ""home"" in on a station. Homing is flying the aircraft on the heading required to keep the needle pointing directly to the 0° (straight ahead) position. To home into a station, tune the station, identify the Morse code signal, then turn the aircraft to bring the ADF azimuth needle to the 0° position. Turn to keep the ADF heading indicator pointing directly ahead. Homing is regarded as poor piloting technique because the aircraft may be blown significantly or dangerously off-course by a cross-wind, and will have to fly further and for longer than the direct track. Tracking. The ADF may also be used to ""track"" a desired course using an ADF and allowing for winds aloft, winds which may blow the aircraft off-course. Good pilotage technique has the pilot calculate a correction angle that exactly balances the expected crosswind. As the flight progresses, the pilot monitors the direction to or from the NDB using the ADF, adjusts the correction as required. A direct track will yield the shortest distance and time to the ADF location. Radio-magnetic indicator (RMI). A radio-magnetic indicator (RMI) is an alternate ADF display providing more information than a standard ADF. While the ADF shows relative angle of the transmitter with respect to the aircraft, an RMI display incorporates a compass card, actuated by the aircraft's compass system, and permits the operator to read the magnetic bearing to or from the transmitting station, without resorting to arithmetic. Most RMI incorporate two direction needles. Often one needle (thicker or double-barred) is connected to an ADF and the other (generally the thin, single-barred needle) is connected to a VOR. Using multiple indicators a navigator can accurately fix the position of their aircraft without requiring station passage. There is great variation between models and the operator must take care that their selection displays information from the appropriate ADF and VOR. References.

wikipedia-19456," Max Horkheimer  Max Horkheimer (February 14, 1895 – July 7, 1973) was a German philosopher and sociologist, famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the 'Frankfurt School' of social research. His most important works include ""The Eclipse of Reason"" (1947), ""Between Philosophy and Social Science"" (1930-1938) and, in collaboration with Theodor Adorno, ""The Dialectic of Enlightenment"" (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible. Biography. Early life. Horkheimer was born in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart, which at the time was the capital of the Kingdom of Württemberg within the German Empire, the only son of a wealthy orthodox Jewish family on February 14, 1895. Due to pressure from his father who wanted Max to take over the family business, Horkheimer left secondary school at the age of sixteen to work in his father's factory. In 1916, his manufacturing career ended when he was drafted into World War I. Education. After World War I, he enrolled at Munich University, where he studied philosophy and psychology. After university, Horkheimer moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he studied under Hans Cornelius. There, he met Theodor Adorno, several years his junior, with whom he would strike a lasting friendship and a fruitful collaborative relationship. In 1925, Horkheimer was habilitated with a dissertation entitled ""Kant's Critique of Judgement as Mediation between Practical and Theoretical Philosophy"", written under Hans Cornelius. Here, he met Pollock who would be his colleague at the Institute of Social Research. He was appointed ""Privatdozent"" the following year. Work with the Institute of Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung). When the Institute for Social Research's directorship became vacant in 1930 after the departure of Karl Grunberg, Horkheimer was elected to the position. In the same year, Horkheimer took over the chair of social philosophy at Frankfurt University. The following year publication of the Institute's ""Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung"" began, with Horkheimer as its editor. Horkheimer intellectually reoriented the Institute, proposing a programme of collective research aimed at specific social groups (namely the working class) that would highlight the problem of the relationship of history and reason. The Institute aimed to integrate the thought of Marx and Freud. The Frankfurt School attempted this by systematically hitching together the different conceptual structures of historical materialism and psychoanalysis. Horkheimer worked to make the Institute a purely academic enterprise. Horkheimer's ""venia legendi"" was revoked by the new Nazi government because of the Marxian nature of the Institute's ideas as well as its prominent Jewish association. The Institute thus closed its location in Germany in 1933. He emigrated to Switzerland, and then to the USA the following year, where Horkheimer met with the president of Columbia University to discuss hosting the Institute. To Horkheimer's surprise, the president agreed to host the Institute in exile as well as offer Horkheimer a building for the Institute. In 1940, Horkheimer received American citizenship and moved to the Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles, California, where his collaboration with Adorno would yield the ""Dialectic of Enlightenment."" In the years that followed, Horkheimer did not publish much, although he continued to edit ""Studies in Philosophy and Social Science"" as a continuation of the ""Zeitschrift."" In 1949, he returned to Frankfurt where the Institute for Social Research reopened in 1950. Between 1951 and 1953 Horkheimer was rector of the University of Frankfurt. In 1953, Horkheimer stepped down from director of the Institute and took on a smaller role in the Institute, while Adorno became director. Horkheimer, however, was seen as the most influential director of the Institute. Later years. Horkheimer continued to teach at the University until his retirement in the mid-1960s. In 1953, he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt, and would later be named honorary citizen of Frankfurt for life. He returned to America in 1954 and 1959 to lecture as a frequent visiting professor at the University of Chicago. He remained an important figure until his death in Nuremberg in 1973. He is buried at the Jewish cemetery in Bern, Switzerland. Thought. Horkheimer's work is marked by a concern to show the relation between affect (especially suffering) and concepts (understood as action-guiding expressions of reason). In this, he responded critically to what he saw as the one-sidedness of both neo-Kantianism (with its focus on concepts) and ""Lebensphilosophie"" (with its focus on expression and world-disclosure). Horkheimer did not think either was wrong, but insisted that the insights of each school on their own could not adequately contribute to the repair of social problems. Horkheimer focused on the connections between social structures, networks/subcultures, and individual realities, concluding that we are affected and shaped by the proliferation of products on the market place. It is also important to note that Horkheimer collaborated with Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. Critical theory. Through critical theory, Horkheimer ""attempted to revitalize radical social, and cultural criticism"" and discussed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis and the poverty of mass culture. Horkheimer helped to create Critical Theory through a mix of radical and conservative lenses that stem from radical Marxism and end up in ""pessimistic Jewish transcendentalism"". Horkheimer developed his critical theory by examining his own wealth while witnessing the juxtaposition of the bourgeois and the impoverished. This critical theory embraced the future possibilities of society and was preoccupied with forces which moved society toward rational institutions that would ensure a true, free, and just life. He was convinced of the need to ""examine the entire material and spiritual culture of mankind"" in order to transform society as a whole. Horkheimer sought to enable the working class to reclaim their power in order to resist the lure of fascism. Horkheimer stated himself that ""the rationally organized society that regulates its own existence"" was necessary along with a society that could ""satisfy common needs"". To satisfy these needs, it would need to engage with the social conditions within which people lived and in which their concepts and actions were formed. It reached out for a total understanding of history and knowledge. Through this, critical theory develops a ""critique of bourgeois society through which 'ideology critique' attempted to locate the 'utopian content' of dominant systems of thought"" Above all, critical theory sought to develop a critical perspective in the discussion of all social practices Writing. Eclipse of Reason. In 1941, Horkheimer outlined how the Nazis had been able to make their agenda appear ""reasonable"", but also issued a warning about the possibility of a similar occurrence happening again. Horkheimer believed that the ills of modern society are caused by misunderstanding of reason: if people use true reason to critique their societies, they will be able to solve problems they may have. Despite the explicit common referrals to ""subjective"" reason in the book, his frequent connecting of it with relativism could be an indication that by ""subjective reason"" Horkheimer also means ""relativist reason"". Between philosophy and social science. ""Between Philosophy and Social Science"" appeared between 1930–1938, during the time the Frankfurt school moved from Frankfurt to Geneva to Columbia University. It included: ""Materialism and Morality"", ""The Present Situation of Moral Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research"", ""On the Problem of Truth"", ""Egoism and the Freedom Movement"", ""History and Psychology"", ""A New Concept of Ideology"", ""Remarks on Philosophical Anthropology"", and ""The Rationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy"". It also included ""The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research"", ""Egoism and Freedom Movements"" and ""Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History"". These essays within ""Between Philosophy and Social Science"" were Horkheimer’s attempts to “remove the individual from mass culture, a function for philosophy from the commodification of everything”. Horkheimer was extremely invested in the individual. ""The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research"" was not only included in this volume, but it was also used as Horkheimer’s inaugural speech as director of the Frankfurt School. In this speech he related economic groups to the struggles and challenges of real life. Horkheimer often referenced human struggle and used this example in his speech because it was a topic he understood well. ""Egoism and Freedom Movements"" and ""Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History"" are the longest of the essays. The first is an evaluation of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Vico; the latter discusses the bourgeois control. In Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History, Horkheimer explained “what he learned from the bourgeois rise to power and what of the bourgeois he thought was worth preserving. The volume also looks at the individual as the “troubled center of philosophy.” Horkheimer expressed that “there is no formula that defines the relationship among individuals, society and nature for all time”. To understand the problem of the individual further, Horkheimer included two case studies on the individual: one on Montaigne and one on himself. Dialectic of Enlightenment. ""Dialectic of Enlightenment"", originally published in 1947, was an extremely influential work that Horkheimer collaborated with his colleague Theodor Adorno. Its main argument was to serve as a wide-ranging critique of the ""self-destruction of enlightenment"". The work criticized popular culture as ""the product of a culture industry whose goal was to stupefy the masses with endless mass produced copies of the same thing"" (Lembert). They argued that these mass-produced things only appear to change over time. They argue that these products are so standardized in order to help consumers comprehend and appreciate the products with little attention given to them. They state, ""the result is a constant reproduction of the same thing"" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1993 ). However, they also explain how pseudo-individuality is encouraged among these products in order to keep the consumers coming back for more. They argue that small differences in products in the same area are acceptable. Criticisms. Horkheimer's work has been largely debated over time. It has been said that after he moved to Los Angeles, his view that ""money is the best protection"" made him manipulate other members of the Institute by keeping them on low salary or dropping them and played Adorno and Marcuse off against each other, creating enemies out of them. Perry Anderson sees Horkheimers attempt to make institute purely academic as “symptomatic of a more universal process, the emergence of a ‘Western Marxism’ divorced from the workingclass movement and dominated by academic philosophers and the 'product of defeat’” because of the isolation of the Russian Revolution. Rolf Wiggerhaus, author of ""The Frankfurt School"" believed Horkheimer lacked the audacious theoretical construction produced by those like Marx and Lukács and that his main argument was that those living in misery had the right to material egoism. In his book, ""Social Theory"", Alex Callinicos claims that ""Dialectic of Enlightenment"" offers no systematic account of conception of rationality, but rather professes objective reason intransigently to an extent. Charles Lemert discusses in his book ""Social Theory"" that in writing '""Dialectic of Enlightenment"", Horkheimer and Adorno lack sufficient sympathy for the cultural plight of the average working person, unfair to criticize the tastes of ordinary people, and that popular culture does not really buttress social conformity and stabilize capitalism as much as the Frankfurt school thinks.

wikipedia-204310," Xuanzang  Xuanzang ( Sanskrit: ह्वेनसांग) (c. 602–664), born Chen Hui () or Chen Yi (), was a Chinese Buddhist monk, scholar, traveler, and translator who described the interaction between China and India in the early Tang Dynasty. Born in what is now Henan province in 602, from boyhood he took to reading religious books, including the Chinese classics and the writings of ancient sages. While residing in the city of Luoyang, Xuanzang entered Buddhist monkhood at the age of thirteen. Due to the political and social unrest caused by the fall of the Sui Dynasty, he went to Chengdu in Sichuan (Szechuan), where he was ordained at the age of twenty. He later traveled throughout China in search of sacred books of Buddhism. At length, he came to Chang'an, then under the peaceful rule of Emperor Taizong of Tang, Xuanzang developed the desire to visit India. He knew about Faxian's visit to India and, like him, was concerned about the incomplete and misinterpreted nature of the Buddhist scriptures that had reached China.  He became famous for his seventeen-year overland journey to India, which is recorded in detail in the classic Chinese text ""Great Tang Records on the Western Regions"", which in turn provided the inspiration for the classical novel ""Journey to the West"", written by Wu Cheng'en during the Ming Dynasty, around nine centuries after Xuanzang's death.  Nomenclature, orthography and etymology. Less common romanizations of ""Xuanzang"" include ""Hhuen Kwan, Hiouen Thsang, Hiuen Tsang, Hiuen Tsiang, Hsien-tsang, Hsyan-tsang, Hsuan Chwang, Hsuan Tsiang, Hwen Thsang, Xuan Cang, Xuan Zang, Shuen Shang, Yuan Chang, Yuan Chwang,"" and ""Yuen Chwang"". ""Hsüan, Hüan, Huan"" and ""Chuang"" are also found. ""Sanzang"" is the Chinese term for the Buddhist canon, or Tripiṭaka, and in some English-language fiction and English translations of ""Journey to the West"", Xuanzang is addressed as ""Tripitaka."" Early life. Xuanzang was born Chen Hui (or Chen Yi) in 602 in Chenhe Village, Goushi Town (緱氏鎮), Luozhou (near present-day Luoyang, Henan) and died on 5 February 664 in Yuhua Palace (玉華宮, in present-day Tongchuan, Shaanxi). His family was noted for its erudition for generations, and Xuanzang was the youngest of four children. His ancestor was Chen Shi (陳寔, 104-186), a minister of the Eastern Han Dynasty. His great-grandfather Chen Qin (陳欽) served as the prefect of Shangdang (上黨; present-day Changzhi, Shanxi) during the Eastern Wei Dynasty; his grandfather Chen Kang (陳康) was a professor in the Taixue (Imperial Academy) during the Northern Qi Dynasty. His father Chen Hui (陳惠) was a conservative Confucianist who served as the magistrate of Jiangling County (江陵縣) during the Sui Dynasty, but later gave up office and withdrew into seclusion to escape the political turmoil that gripped China towards the end of the Sui. According to traditional biographies, Xuanzang displayed a superb intelligence and earnestness, amazing his father by his careful observance of the Confucian rituals at the age of eight. Along with his brothers and sister, he received an early education from his father, who instructed him in classical works on filial piety and several other canonical treatises of orthodox Confucianism. Although his household was essentially Confucian, at a young age, Xuanzang expressed interest in becoming a Buddhist monk as one of his elder brothers had done. After the death of his father in 611, he lived with his older brother Chen Su (陳素) (later known as Changjie 長捷) for five years at Jingtu Monastery (淨土寺) in Luoyang, supported by the Sui Dynasty state. During this time he studied Mahayana Buddhism and various early Buddhist schools, preferring Mahayana. In 618, the Sui Dynasty collapsed and Xuanzang and his brother fled to Chang'an, which had been proclaimed as the capital of the Tang Dynasty, and thence southward to Chengdu, Sichuan. Here the two brothers spent two or three years in further study in the monastery of Kong Hui, including the ""Abhidharmakosa-sastra"" (Abhidharma Storehouse Treatise). When Xuanzang requested to take Buddhist orders at the age of thirteen, the abbot Zheng Shanguo made an exception in his case because of his precocious knowledge. Xuanzang was fully ordained as a monk in 622, at the age of twenty. The myriad contradictions and discrepancies in the texts at that time prompted Xuanzang to decide to go to India and study in the cradle of Buddhism. He subsequently left his brother and returned to Chang'an to study foreign languages and to continue his study of Buddhism. He began his mastery of Sanskrit in 626, and probably also studied Tocharian. During this time, Xuanzang also became interested in the metaphysical Yogacara school of Buddhism. Pilgrimage. In 629, Xuanzang reportedly had a dream that convinced him to journey to India. The Tang Dynasty and Eastern Türk Göktürks were waging war at the time; therefore Emperor Taizong of Tang prohibited foreign travel. Xuanzang persuaded some Buddhist guards at the gates of Yumen and slipped out of the empire via Liangzhou (Gansu), and Qinghai province in 629. He subsequently travelled across the Gobi Desert to Kumul (Hami), thence following the Tian Shan westward, arriving in Turpan in 630. Here he met the king of Turpan, a Buddhist who equipped him further for his travels with letters of introduction and valuables to serve as funds. Moving further westward, Xuanzang escaped robbers to reach Yanqi, then toured the non-Mahayana monasteries of Kucha. Further west he passed Aksu before turning northwest to cross the Tian Shan's Bedel Pass into modern Kyrgyzstan. He skirted Issyk Kul before visiting Tokmak on its northwest, and met the great Khan of the Western Türk, whose relationship to the Tang emperor was friendly at the time. After a feast, Xuanzang continued west then southwest to Tashkent (Chach/Che-Shih), capital of modern Uzbekistan. From here, he crossed the desert further west to Samarkand. In Samarkand, which was under Persian influence, the party came across some abandoned Buddhist temples and Xuanzang impressed the local king with his preaching. Setting out again to the south, Xuanzang crossed a spur of the Pamirs and passed through the famous Iron Gates. Continuing southward, he reached the Amu Darya and Termez, where he encountered a community of more than a thousand Buddhist monks. Further east he passed through Kunduz, where he stayed for some time to witness the funeral rites of Prince Tardu, who had been poisoned. Here he met the monk Dharmasimha, and on the advice of the late Tardu made the trip westward to Balkh (modern day Afghanistan), to see the Buddhist sites and relics, especially the Nava Vihara, or Nawbahar, which he described as the westernmost monastic institution in the world. Here Xuanzang also found over 3,000 non-Mahayana monks, including Prajnakara (般若羯羅 or 慧性), a monk with whom Xuanzang studied early Buddhist scriptures. He acquired the important Mahāvibhāṣa (大毗婆沙論) text here, which he later translated into Chinese. Prajnakara then accompanied the party southward to Bamyan, where Xuanzang met the king and saw tens of non-Mahayana monasteries, in addition to the two large Bamyan Buddhas carved out of the rockface. The party then resumed their travel eastward, crossing the Shibar Pass and descending to the regional capital of Kapisi (about 60 km north of modern Kabul), which sported over 100 monasteries and 6,000 monks, mostly Mahayana. This was part of the fabled old land of Gandhara. Xuanzang took part in a religious debate here, and demonstrated his knowledge of many Buddhist schools. Here he also met the first Jains and Hindus of his journey. He pushed on to Adinapur (later named Jalalabad) and Laghman, where he considered himself to have reached India. The year was 630. India. Xuanzang left Adinapur, which had few Buddhist monks, but many stupas and monasteries. His travels included, passing through Hunza and the Khyber Pass to the east, reaching the former capital of Gandhara, Purushapura (Peshawar), on the other side. Peshawar was nothing compared to its former glory, and Buddhism was declining in the region. Xuanzang visited a number of stupas around Peshawar, notably the Kanishka Stupa. This stupa was built just southeast of Peshawar, by a former king of the city. In 1908, it was rediscovered by D.B. Spooner with the help of Xuanzang's account. Xuanzang left Peshawar and travelled northeast to the Swat Valley (the location of Oḍḍiyāna is disputed between Swat valley and Odisha). Reaching Oḍḍiyāna, he found 1,400 old monasteries, that had previously supported 18,000 monks. The remnant monks were of the Mahayana school. Xuanzang continued northward and into the Buner Valley, before doubling back via Shabaz Gharni to cross the Indus river at Hund. Thereafter he headed to Taxila (呾叉始羅), a Mahayana Buddhist kingdom that was a vassal of Kashmir, which is precisely where he headed next. Here he found 5,000 more Buddhist monks in 100 monasteries. He went to Kashmir in 631, met a talented monk Samghayasas (僧伽耶舍), and studied there. Between 632 and early 633, he studied with various monks, including 14 months with Vinītaprabha (毘膩多缽臘婆 or 調伏光), 4 months with Candravarman (旃達羅伐摩 or 月胃), and ""a winter and half a spring"" with Jayagupta (闍耶毱多). During this time, Xuanzang writes about the Fourth Buddhist council that took place nearby, ca. 100 AD, under the order of King Kanishka of Kushana. He visited Chiniot and Lahore as well and provided the earliest writings available on the ancient cities. In 634, Xuanzang arrived in Matipura (秣底補羅), nowadays known as Mandawar. In 634, he went east to Jalandhar in eastern Punjab, before climbing up to visit predominantly non-Mahayana monasteries in the Kulu valley and turning southward again to Bairat and then Mathura, on the Yamuna river. Mathura had 2,000 monks of both major Buddhist branches, despite being Hindu-dominated. Xuanzang travelled up the river to Srughna before crossing eastward to Matipura, where he arrived in 635, having crossed the river Ganges. At Matipura Monastery, Xuanzang studied under Mitrasena. From here, he headed south to Sankasya (Kapitha), said to be where Buddha descended from heaven, then onward to the northern Indian emperor Harsha's grand capital of Kanyakubja (Kannauj). It is believed he also visited Govishan present day Kashipur in the Harsha era, in 636, Xuanzang encountered 100 monasteries of 10,000 monks (both Mahayana and non-Mahayana), and was impressed by the king's patronage of both scholarship and Buddhism. Xuanzang spent time in the city studying early Buddhist scriptures, before setting off eastward again for Ayodhya (Saketa), homeland of the Yogacara school. Xuanzang now moved south to Kausambi (Kosam), where he had a copy made from an important local image of the Buddha. Xuanzang now returned northward to Sravasti, travelled through Terai in the southern part of modern Nepal (here he found deserted Buddhist monasteries) and thence to Kapilavastu, his last stop before Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha. In 637, Xuanzang set out from Lumbini to Kusinagara, the site of Buddha's death, before heading southwest to the deer park at Sarnath where Buddha gave his first sermon, and where Xuanzang found 1,500 resident monks. Travelling eastward, at first via Varanasi, Xuanzang reached Vaisali, Pataliputra (Patna) and Bodh Gaya. He was then accompanied by local monks to Nalanda, the great Buddhist university of Indian state of Bihar, where he spent at least the next two years. He was in the company of several thousand scholar-monks, whom he praised. Xuanzang studied logic, grammar, Sanskrit, and the Yogacara school of Buddhism during his time at Nalanda. René Grousset notes that it was at Nalanda (where an ""azure pool winds around the monasteries, adorned with the full-blown cups of the blue lotus; the dazzling red flowers of the lovely kanaka hang here and there, and outside groves of mango trees offer the inhabitants their dense and protective shade"") that Xuanzang met the venerable Silabhadra, the monastery's superior. Silabhadra had dreamt of Xuanzang's arrival and that it would help spread far and wide the Holy Law. Grousset writes: ""The Chinese pilgrim had finally found the omniscient master, the incomparable metaphysician who was to make known to him the ultimate secrets of the idealist systems...The founders of Mahayana idealism, Asanga and Vasubandhu...Dignaga...Dharmapala had in turn trained Silabhadra. Siladhadra was thus in a position to make available to the Sino-Japanese world the entire heritage of Buddhist idealism, and the ""Siddhi"" Hiuan Tsang's great philosophical treatise...is none other than the ""Summa"" of this doctrine, the fruit of seven centuries of Indian thought."" From Nalanda, Xuanzang travelled through several countries, including Campā, to the capital of Pundravardhana, identified with modern Mahasthangarh, in Bangladesh. There Xuanzang found 20 monasteries with over 3,000 monks studying both the Hinayana and the Mahayana. One of them was the Vāśibhã Monastery (Po Shi Po), where he found over 700 Mahayana monks from all over East India. He also visited Somapura Mahavihara at Paharpur in the district of Naogaon,Bangladesh. After crossing the Karatoya, he went east to the ancient city of Pragjyotishpur (modern Guwahati) in the kingdom of Kamarupa (modern Assam) at the invitation of its Buddhist king Kumar Bhaskaravarman. Later, the king escorted Xuanzang back to the Kannauj at the request of king Harshavardhana, who was an ally of Kumar Bhaskaravarman, to attend a great Buddhist council there which was attended by both the kings. Xuanzang turned southward and travelled to Andhradesa to visit the famous Viharas at Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda. He stayed at Amaravati and studied 'Abhidhammapitakam'. He observed that there were many Viharas at Amaravati and some of them were deserted. He later proceeded to Kanchi, the imperial capital of Pallavas and a strong centre of Buddhism. Traveling through the Khyber Pass of the Hindu Kush, Xuanzang passed through Kashgar, Khotan, and Dunhuang on his way back to China. He arrived in the capital, Chang'an, on the seventh day of the first month of 645, and a great procession celebrated his return. Return to China. On his return to China in AD 645, Xuanzang was greeted with much honor but he refused all high civil appointments offered by the still-reigning emperor, Emperor Taizong of Tang. Instead, he retired to a monastery and devoted his energy to translating Buddhist texts until his death in AD 664. Chinese Buddhism (influence). During Xuanzang's travels, he studied with many famous Buddhist masters, especially at the famous center of Buddhist learning at Nālanda University. When he returned, he brought with him some 657 Sanskrit texts. With the emperor's support, he set up a large translation bureau in Chang'an (present-day Xi'an), drawing students and collaborators from all over East Asia. He is credited with the translation of some 1,330 fascicles of scriptures into Chinese. His strongest personal interest in Buddhism was in the field of Yogācāra (瑜伽行派), or ""Consciousness-only"" (唯識). The force of his own study, translation and commentary of the texts of these traditions initiated the development of the Faxiang school (法相宗) in East Asia. Although the school itself did not thrive for a long time, its theories regarding perception, consciousness, karma, rebirth, etc. found their way into the doctrines of other more successful schools. Xuanzang's closest and most eminent student was Kuiji (窺基) who became recognized as the first patriarch of the Faxiang school. Xuanzang's logic, as described by Kuiji, was often misunderstood by scholars of Chinese Buddhism because they lack the necessary background in Indian logic. Another important disciple was the Korean monk Woncheuk. Xuanzang was known for his extensive but careful translations of Indian Buddhist texts to Chinese, which have enabled subsequent recoveries of lost Indian Buddhist texts from the translated Chinese copies. He is credited with writing or compiling the ""Cheng Weishi Lun"" as a commentary on these texts. His translation of the Heart Sutra became and remains the standard in all East Asian Buddhist sects. He also founded the short-lived but influential Faxiang school of Buddhism. Additionally, he was known for recording the events of the reign of the northern Indian emperor, Harsha. The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. Xuanzang returned to China with three copies of the ""Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra"". Xuanzang, with a team of disciple translators, commenced translating the voluminous work in 660 CE, using all three versions to ensure the integrity of the source documentation. Xuanzang was being encouraged by a number of his disciple translators to render an abridged version. After a suite of dreams quickened his decision, Xuanzang determined to render an unabridged, complete volume, faithful to the original of 600 chapters. Autobiography and biography. In 646, under the Emperor's request, Xuanzang completed his book ""Great Tang Records on the Western Regions"" (大唐西域記), which has become one of the primary sources for the study of medieval Central Asia and India. This book was first translated into French by the Sinologist Stanislas Julien in 1857. There was also a biography of Xuanzang written by the monk Huili (慧立). Both books were first translated into English by Samuel Beal, in 1884 and 1911 respectively. An English translation with copious notes by Thomas Watters was edited by T.W. Rhys Davids and S.W. Bushell, and published posthumously in London in 1905. Legacy. Xuanzang's work, the ""Great Tang Records on the Western Regions"", is the longest and most detailed account of the countries of Central and South Asia that has been bestowed upon posterity by a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim. While his main purpose was to obtain Buddhist books and to receive instruction on Buddhism while in India, he ended up doing much more. He has preserved the records of political and social aspects of the lands he visited. His record of the places visited by him in Bengal — mainly Raktamrittika near Karnasuvarna, Pundranagara and its environs, Samatata and Tamralipti — have been very helpful in the recording of the archaeological history of Bengal. His account has also shed welcome light on the history of 7th century Bengal, especially the Gauda kingdom under Shashanka, although at times he can be quite partisan. Xuanzang obtained and translated 657 Sanskrit Buddhist works. He received the best education on Buddhism he could find throughout India. Much of this activity is detailed in the companion volume to Xiyu Ji, the Biography of Xuanzang written by Huili, entitled the Life of Xuanzang. His version of the Heart Sutra is the basis for all Chinese commentaries on the sutra, and recitations throughout China, Korea and Japan. His style was, by Chinese standards, cumbersome and overly literal, and marked by scholarly innovations in terminology; usually, where another version by the earlier translator Kumārajīva exists, Kumārajīva's is more popular. Xuanzang's journey along the so-called Silk Road, and the legends that grew up around it, inspired the Ming novel ""Journey to the West"", one of the great classics of Chinese literature. The Xuanzang of the novel is the reincarnation of a disciple of Gautama Buddha, and is protected on his journey by three powerful disciples. One of them, the monkey, was a popular favourite and profoundly influenced Chinese culture and contemporary Japanese manga and anime (including the popular ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Saiyuki"" series), and became well known in the West by Arthur Waley's translation and later the cult TV series ""Monkey"". In the Yuan Dynasty, there was also a play by Wu Changling (吳昌齡) about Xuanzang obtaining scriptures. Relics. A skull relic purported to be that of Xuanzang was held in the Temple of Great Compassion, Tianjin until 1956 when it was taken to Nalanda - allegedly by the Dalai Lama - and presented to India. The relic is now in the Patna museum. The Wenshu Monastery in Chengdu, Sichuan province also claims to have part of Xuanzang's skull. Part of Xuanzang's remains were taken from Nanjing by soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army in 1942, and are now enshrined at Yakushi-ji in Nara, Japan. "

Football career. Manchester City. He was the top-scorer for the Manchester City reserve team in the season 2003–04. On 6 December 2004, he scored his first Premier League goal within minutes of making his league debut against Middlesbrough. Southampton. After many frustrating appearances for Manchester City, with few goals, he was sold to Championship team Southampton for £500,000 in the summer of 2006. The fee was partly funded by a prize from Coca-Cola won in a competition amongst fans. He made an immediate impact at Southampton, scoring on his debut against Derby County at Pride Park, and scoring an impressive goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 2–0 win at St. Mary's. He scored a total of 11 goals in the 2006–07 season. In 2007–08 he started the season with goals against Burnley and Queens Park Rangers. Plymouth Argyle. At the end of the 2008–09 season following Southampton's relegation to League One, Wright-Phillips was released from his contract at the club. On 15 July 2009, he signed a two-year deal with Plymouth Argyle. After he recovered from a knee injury, Wright-Phillips made his debut for the club on 15 September 2009 against Watford. The knee injury re-occurred once again and he was sidelined for another long-term spell. In January 2010, Plymouth Argyle's manager, Paul Mariner, declared that Wright-Phillips wasn't far away from full fitness and he made his long awaited return for Argyle in the FA Cup against Newcastle United that month. He made his first start for the club against Coventry City in March 2010. He scored his first goal for Plymouth against Bristol City on 16 March 2010. On 11 December 2010, Wright-Phillips scored both goals against Exeter City in the Devon derby in a 2–0 Plymouth win, the second marked his 12th of the season. Charlton Athletic. On 24 January 2011, it was announced that Wright-Phillips was moving to fellow League One club Charlton Athletic for an undisclosed fee. He scored the only goal on his debut against Colchester United on 1 February 2011. On 28 February 2012, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win at Chesterfield. He was released by Charlton at the end of the 2012–13 season. Brentford. On 19 February 2013, he joined Brentford on loan until the end of the season. He was man of the match on 13 April 2013 against Portsmouth. He scored two crucial goals and provided the winning assist for Clayton Donaldson. However, it wasn't enough to see Brentford promoted to the Championship. New York Red Bulls. On 24 July 2013, Wright-Phillips joined New York Red Bulls. Personal life. On 9 March 2008, Wright-Phillips, along with team-mate Nathan Dyer, was accused of stealing money, mobile phones and other items from bar staff at Bar Bluu in Southsea in the early hours of 28 February 2008. CCTV footage taken at the time appeared to show a theft taking place. On 25 March 2008, Dyer and Wright-Phillips were both arrested over the theft and were questioned at a Portsmouth police station. They were formally charged with burglary on 17 June. They appeared before Portsmouth magistrates on 8 July 2008. Dyer was convicted of burglary and sentenced to community service and made to pay compensation and costs. Wright-Phillips pleaded not guilty, and opted to be tried at Crown Court. He was due to appear before Portsmouth magistrates again on 2 September 2008. However, the case was dismissed by the District Judge following legal argument from Wright-Phillips' barrister, Rupert Bowers, that there was insufficient evidence. A year later he and team-mate David McGoldrick were arrested on suspicion of assaulting a Southampton supporter while on a night out. The 21-year-old Saints fan told police that he was attacked by the two footballers in a Southampton street as he made his way home from a night out. The incident is alleged to have happened on Saturday, 7 February after players went drinking in the city. On 13 March, the club announced: ""After a thorough police investigation the Crown Prosecution Service has decided not to press any charges against either Bradley Wright-Phillips or David McGoldrick, and no further action will be taken against them.""

History of the development of AERMOD. AERMOD was developed by the AERMIC (American Meteorological Society (AMS)/United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulatory Model Improvement Committee), a collaborative working group of scientists from the AMS and the EPA. The AERMIC was initially formed in 1991.  The AERMIC developed AERMOD in seven steps: On April 21 of 2000, the EPA proposed that AERMOD be adopted as the EPA's preferred regulatory model for both simple and complex terrain. On November 9 of 2005, AERMOD was adopted by the EPA and promulgated as their preferred regulatory model, effective as of December 9 of 2005. The entire developmental and adoption process took 14 years (from 1991 to 2005). Features and capabilities of AERMOD. Some of the primary features and capabilities of AERMOD are: Further reading.

wikipedia-417758," Knowlton Nash  Cyril Knowlton Nash, OC, OOnt (born November 18, 1927) is a Canadian journalist, author, and former long-serving senior anchorman of CBC Television's flagship news program, """". He began his career in journalism by selling newspapers on the streets of Toronto during World War II. Before age 20, he was a professional journalist for British United Press. After some time as a freelance foreign correspondent, he became the CBC Washington correspondent during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, also covering stories in South and Central America and Vietnam. He moved back to Toronto in 1968 to join management as head of CBC's news and information programming, then stepped back in front of the camera in 1978 as anchor of CBC's late evening news program, ""The National"". He stepped down from that position in 1988 to make way for Peter Mansbridge. Nash has written several books about Canadian journalism and television, including his own memoirs as a foreign correspondent. Early life. Nash was born in Toronto in 1927, and named Cyril after his father, a racetrack betting manager. However, the young boy didn't like being called ""Cyril Junior"", and at age five, Nash asked his parents to instead call him by his middle name, Knowlton. From an early age, Nash was fascinated with the world of journalism: by age 8, he was writing his own news sheet, by age 9 he was writing letters to the editors of Toronto newspapers, and by age 10 he was operating a newsstand. In 1940, at age 12, Nash was a newspaper boy on the streets of Toronto selling the ""Toronto Star"" and ""Toronto Telegram"" for three cents a copy. Career. Print journalism. In his early teens, Nash reported on weekly high school sports for ""The Globe and Mail"". In 1944, he dropped out of high school to become editor of ""Canadian High News"", a small weekly tabloid distributed to most high schools in southern Ontario. His fellow staff members included Keith Davey and Robert McMichael. The following year, he spent some time editing a couple of crime magazines, then reported for a Toronto neighbourhood newspaper for a few months. Nash and some former staff members from ""Canadian High News"" then bought up a two neighbourhood newspapers, but with little advertising revenue, both papers quickly ran out of money and went out of business. Wire service reporter. In 1947, at age 19, Nash was hired as night editor in the Toronto office of British United Press (BUP), a wire news service affiliated with United Press. This mainly involved ""scalping"" news stories from the Toronto newspapers—rewriting stories covered by the newspapers, then filing them via teletype. After a few months, Nash also started to write original feature articles, and was also sent to cover the Ontario provincial legislature as well as professional sports events in Toronto. The following year, Nash was assigned to BUP's Halifax office as bureau manager, responsible for news coverage in the Canadian Maritimes and Newfoundland. In 1949, he was promoted to manager of BUP's Vancouver office, where he covered the protests by the ""Sons of Freedom"" sect of Doukhobors, and interviewed various celebrities, including Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. In 1951, at age 23, Nash returned to BUP's Toronto office, this time as bureau manager. Among other stories, he covered the death of William “Red” Hill Jr., who was trying to emulate his daredevil father by going over Niagara Falls in a floating contraption; and the 1951 Canadian royal tour of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip. IFAP editor and researcher. In 1951, Nash was hired by the Washington, D.C.-based International Federation of Agricultural Producers (IFAP) to gather information and edit their monthly newsletter. His office was right across the street from the White House—he would often see President Harry S Truman walking by with his Secret Service detail on noon-hour walks. Research for his work brought him in touch with many officials, and he quickly developed a network of contacts within Washington power circles. His work with IFAP made Nash a world traveller, with a dozen trips to Europ via steamship, plus visits to Mexico and Central America as well as Africa. It also brought him in contact with many notables, including Pope Pius XII, Dag Hammerskjold, Lord Boyd Orr, Dwight Eisenhower and future Dutch prime minister Barend Biesheuvel.  It was on a trip to Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising in 1954 that Nash also became a freelance foreign correspondent, sending several radio reports on the unrest to the CBC and BBC while he attended an IFAP conference in Nairobi. He continued to file freelance stories for the CBC and the ""Financial Post"" while travelling abroad, and became a stringer for the ""Windsor Star"". He also occasionally wrote for the ""Family Herald"", ""Maclean's"", ""Chatelaine"" and the ""Star Weekly"". Freelance journalist. Having developed a strong network of contacts in the Washington area, Nash left IFAP to become a freelance journalist in 1958. Politics had always been a passion, and in order to write and file stories for many media outlets, he now had the opportunity to meet many American politicians, including Joseph McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Adlai Stevenson, Lyndon B. Johnson, and the up-and-coming John F. Kennedy and his brothers Bob and Ted Kennedy. His first major political event was the 1960 Democratic National Convention, where he was an eyewitness to many of the backroom and convention floor deals that resulted in the nomination of John F. Kennedy.  Nash's first television news assignment was covering the funeral of John Foster Dulles for the CBC on May 27, 1959. Nash initially was not that interested in doing television reports, which only earned him the same fee as radio reports but took much longer to prepare; however, he soon realized that the future of news reportage lay in television, and did all he could to learn about the new medium.  In addition to covering political news in Washington, Nash also travelled around the United States and internationally. His many assignments included Nash also travelled back to Canada to cover Canadian political events for CBC, including television coverage of election night for the federal elections of 1962, 1963 and 1965; the 1965 Saskatchewan Doctors' Strike; and the Gerda Munsinger sex scandal of 1966.  Freelance correspondents were not well paid by CBC, and in 1965, Nash helped to form the CBC Foreign Correspondents Association in order to negotiate a better wage for members, and became its first vice-president.  Nash also made extended trips abroad, including a half-dozen visits to Central and South America, and two trips to Southeast Asia to provide a Canadian perspective to the Vietnam War. He also interviewed many prominent newsmakers of the time, including Pierre Salinger, George Lincoln Rockwell, Allen Dulles, Dick Gregory, Ronald Reagan, Columbian president Guillermo León Valencia, Venezuelan president Romulo Betancourt and Dean Rusk. CBC management and chief correspondent. Nash joined the CBC's management as head of news and information programming in 1968, moving back to Toronto, and became anchor of ""The National"" following the departure of Peter Kent in 1978. During his tenure, the program expanded from 15 minutes to the first segment of an hour long news package with ""The National"" being followed by ""The Journal"", which featured interviews and documentaries. Retirement. In 1988, Nash offered to retire from his duties at ""The National"" in order to keep Peter Mansbridge from accepting an offer to host the morning news at the American network CBS. Nash left his position as CBC News' senior anchor and chief correspondent in 1988, but still anchored the broadcast on Saturday evenings and filled-in for Mansbridge until he officially retired from CBC News on November 28, 1992. He also hosted various programs on CBC Newsworld in the 1990s, and from 1990 to 2004 was host of the CBC's educational series ""News in Review"". Personal. (Nash was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 2002.) He lives in Toronto with his wife, former CBC personality Lorraine Thomson, and his family. "
wikipedia-1667096," Bolton Castle  Bolton Castle is a 14th-century castle located in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire (). The nearby village Castle Bolton takes its name from the castle. The castle is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The castle was damaged in the English Civil War, but much of it remains. It has never been sold and is still in the ownership of the descendants of the Scrope family. History. The castle was built between 1378 and 1399 by Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton and Chancellor of England, and is an example of a quadrangular castle. The licence to build it was granted in July 1379 and a contract with the mason Johan Lewyn was made in September 1378. Construction was reputed to cost 18,000 Marks. The 16th century writer John Leland described 'An Astronomical Clock' in the courtyard and how smoke was conveyed from the hearth in the hall through tunnels. Bolton Castle was described by Sir Francis Knollys as having 'The highest walls of any house he had seen'. In 1536 Sir John Scrope, 8th Baron Scrope of Bolton supported the Pilgrimage of Grace rebellion against the religious reforms of King Henry VIII and gave Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx sanctuary in the castle. In consequence John Scrope had to flee to Skipton pursued by the King's men but Abbot Sedbar was caught and executed. In retribution the king ordered Bolton castle to be torched, causing extensive damage. Within a few years the damage had been repaired and Sir John had regained his seat in Parliament. Mary, Queen of Scots, at Bolton. Mary, Queen of Scots stayed at Bolton for six months. After her defeat in Scotland at the Battle of Langside in 1568 she fled to England, posing a threat to the position of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I. Mary was initially held at Carlisle Castle under the watch of Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton, but Carlisle proved unsuitable and in July 1568 Mary was moved to Bolton. Mary was given Henry Scrope's own apartments in the South-West tower. Of her retinue of 51 knights, servants and ladies-in-waiting only 30 of her men and six ladies-in-waiting were able to stay in the castle, the rest taking lodgings nearby. Her household included cooks, grooms, hairdresser, embroiderer, apothecary, physician and surgeon. Bolton Castle was not initially suitable for housing a Queen, so tapestries, rugs and furniture were borrowed from local houses and nearby Barnard Castle in County Durham. Queen Elizabeth herself loaned some pewter vessels as well as a copper kettle. Mary was allowed to wander the surrounding lands and often went hunting. Her prime occupation while at the castle was having her hair done by her friend Mary Seton. Sir Francis Knollys, whom Mary nicknamed 'Schoolmaster', taught her English, as she only spoke French, Latin and the Scots language. She even met with local Catholics, something for which Knollys and Scrope were severely reprimanded. In January 1569 Mary left Bolton Castle for the last time, being taken to Tutbury in Staffordshire where she spent much of the 18 years before her execution in 1587. Later history. After the death in 1630 of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland, without any legitimate children, Bolton Castle was inherited by Mary the eldest of his three illegitimate daughters. She married Charles Powlett, 6th Marquess of Winchester and 1st Duke of Bolton.  The castle is currently owned by their descendant, Harry, the eighth Lord Bolton, who resides at nearby Bolton Hall, which was originally built in 1675. Bolton Castle is run by his son and daughter-in-law, Tom and Katie Orde-Powlett. There is a garden including a maze, herb garden, wild flower meadow, rose garden and a vineyard on the site in addition to the castle. Film location. Several movies and television productions have used the castle as a location including; "
wikipedia-253441," Leo VI the Wise  Leo VI, surnamed the Wise or the Philosopher (, ""Leōn VI ho Sophos"", 19 September 866 – 11 May 912), was Byzantine Emperor from 886 to 912. The second ruler of the Macedonian dynasty (although his parentage is unclear), he was very well-read, leading to his surname. During his reign, the renaissance of letters, begun by his predecessor Basil I, continued; but the Empire also saw several military defeats in the Balkans against Bulgaria and against the Arabs in Sicily and the Aegean. Early life. Born to the empress Eudokia Ingerina, Leo was either the illegitimate son of Emperor Michael III or the second son of his successor, Basil I the Macedonian. Eudokia was both Michael III's mistress and Basil’s wife. In 867, Michael was assassinated by Basil, who succeeded him as Emperor. As the second eldest son of the Emperor, Leo was associated on the throne in 870 and became the direct heir on the death of his older half-brother Constantine in 879. However, Leo and Basil did not like each other; a relationship that only deteriorated after Eudokia's death, when Leo, unhappy with his marriage to Theophano Martiniake, took up a mistress in the person of Zoe Zaoutzaina. Basil married Zoe off to an insignificant official, and later almost had Leo blinded when he was accused of conspiring against him. On August 29, 886, Basil died in a hunting accident, though he claimed on his deathbed that there was an assassination attempt in which Leo was possibly involved. Domestic policy. One of the first actions of Leo VI after his succession was the reburial, with great ceremony, of the remains of Michael III in the imperial mausoleum within the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. This contributed to the suspicion that Leo was (or at least believed himself to be) in truth Michael's son. Seeking political reconciliation, the new Emperor secured the support of the officials in the capital, and surrounded himself with bureaucrats like Stylianos Zaoutzes (the father of his mistress, Zoe Zaoutzaina) and the eunuch Samonas, an Arab defector whom Leo raised to the rank of ""patrikios"" and who stood in as godfather to Leo’s son, Constantine VII. His attempts to control the great aristocratic families (e.g., the Phokadai and the Doukai) occasionally led to serious conflicts, the most significant being the revolt of Andronikos Doukas in 906. Leo also attempted to control the church through his appointments to the patriarchate. He dismissed the Patriarch Photios, who had been his tutor, and replaced him with his own 19-year-old brother Stephen in December 886. On Stephen's death in 893, Leo replaced him with Zaoutzes' nominee, Antony II Kauleas, who died in 901. Leo then promoted his own Imperial secretary (""mystikos"") Nicholas, but suspicions that he was involved in the failed assassination attempt against Leo in 903 as well as his opposition to Leo’s fourth marriage saw Nicholas replaced with Leo’s spiritual father Euthymios in 907. The magnificent Church of Ayios Lazaros in Larnaca was constructed during the rule of Leo VI in the late 9th century, and it was built after the relics of St. Lazaros were transported from Crete to Constantinople. The church is one of the best examples of Byzantine architecture. Leo also completed work on the ""Basilika"", the Greek translation and update of the law code issued by Justinian I, which had been started during the reign of Basil. Bishop Liutprand of Cremona gives an account similar to those about Caliph Harun al-Rashid, to the effect that Leo would sometimes disguise himself and go about Constantinople looking for injustice or corruption. According to one story, he was even captured by the city guards during one of his investigations. Late in the evening, he was walking alone and disguised. Though he bribed two patrols with 12 ""nomismata"" and moved on, a third city patrol arrested him. When a terrified guardian recognized the jailed ruler in the morning, the arresting officer was rewarded for doing his duty, while the other patrols were dismissed and punished severely. Foreign policy. Leo VI's fortune in war was more mixed than Basil's had been. In indulging his chief counselor Stylianos Zaoutzes, Leo provoked a war with Simeon I of Bulgaria in 894, but he was defeated. Bribing the Magyars to attack the Bulgarians from the north, Leo scored an indirect success in 895. However, deprived of his new allies, he lost the major Battle of Boulgarophygon in 896 and had to make the required commercial concessions and to pay annual tribute. Although he won a victory in 900 against the Emirate of Tarsus, in which the Arab army was destroyed and the Emir himself captured, in the west the Emirate of Sicily took Taormina, the last Byzantine outpost on the island of Sicily, in 902. Nevertheless, Leo continued to apply pressure on his eastern frontier through the creation of the new ""thema"" of Mesopotamia, a Byzantine invasion of Armenia in 902, and the sacking of Theodosiopolis, as well as successful raids in the Arab ""Thughur"". Then, in 904 the renegade Leo of Tripolis sacked Thessalonica with his pirates – an event described in ""The Capture of Thessalonica"" by John Kaminiates – while a large-scale expedition to recover Crete under Himerios in 911–912 failed disastrously. Nevertheless, the same period also saw the establishment of the important frontier provinces (""kleisourai"") of Lykandos and Leontokome on territory recently taken from the Arabs. In 907 Constantinople was attacked by the Kievan Rus' under Oleg of Novgorod, who was seeking favourable trading rights with the empire. Leo paid them off, but they attacked again in 911, and a trade treaty was finally signed. The Moechian Controversy. Leo VI caused a major scandal with his numerous marriages which failed to produce a legitimate heir to the throne. His first wife Theophano, whom Basil had forced him to marry on account of her family connections to the Martinakioi, and whom Leo hated, died in 897, and Leo married Zoe Zaoutzaina, the daughter of his adviser Stylianos Zaoutzes, though she died as well in 899. Upon this marriage Leo created the title of ""basileopatōr"" (""father of the emperor"") for his father-in-law. After Zoe's death a third marriage was technically illegal, but he married again, only to have his third wife Eudokia Baïana die in 901. Instead of marrying a fourth time, which would have been an even greater sin than a third marriage (according to the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos) Leo took as mistress Zoe Karbonopsina. He married her only after she had given birth to a son in 905, but incurred the opposition of the patriarch. Replacing Nicholas Mystikos with Euthymios, Leo got his marriage recognized by the church (albeit with a long penance attached, and with an assurance that Leo would outlaw all future fourth marriages) but opened up a conflict (the so-called ""Moechian Controversy"" from the Greek ""moichos"", ""adulterer"")) within it and allowed new grounds for papal intervention into Byzantine affairs when he sought and obtained papal consent. Succession. The future Constantine VII was the illegitimate son born before Leo's uncanonical fourth marriage to Zoe Karbonopsina. To strengthen his son's position as heir, Leo had him crowned as co-emperor on May 15, 908, when he was only two years old. Leo VI died on May 11, 912. He was succeeded by his younger brother Alexander, who had reigned as Emperor alongside his father and brother since 879. Works. Leo VI was a prolific writer, and he produced works on many different topics and in many styles, including political orations, liturgical poems, and theological treatises. On many occasions he would personally deliver highly wrought and convoluted sermons in the churches of Constantinople. In the subject matter of legal works and treatises, he established a legal commission that carried out his father's original intent of codifying all of existing Byzantine law. The end result was a six-volume work consisting of 60 books, entitled the ""Basilika"". Written in Greek, the ""Basilika"" translated and systematically arranged practically all of the laws preserved in the ""Corpus Juris Civilis"", thereby providing a foundation upon which all later Byzantine laws could be built. Leo then began integrating new laws issued during his reign into the ""Basilika"". Called ""Novels"", or ""New Laws"", these were codes that dealt with current problems and issues, such as the prohibition on fourth marriages. Both the ""Basilika"" and the Novels were concerned with ecclesiastical law (canon law) as well as secular law. Most importantly, from a historical perspective, they finally did away with much of the remaining legal and constitutional architecture that the Byzantine Empire had inherited from the Roman Empire, and even from the days of the Roman Republic. Obsolete institutions such as the Curiae, the Roman Senate, even the Consulate, were finally removed from a legal perspective, even though these still continued in a lesser, decorative form. The supposed ""Book of the Eparch"" and the ""Kletorologion"" of Philotheos were also issued under Leo's name and testify to his government’s interest in organization and the maintenance of public order. The ""Book of the Eparch"" described the rules and regulations for trade and trade organizations in Constantinople, while the ""Kletorologion"" was an attempt to standardize officials and ranks at the Byzantine court. Leo is also the author, or at least sponsor, of the ""Tactica"", a notable treatise on military operations. Succeeding generations saw Leo as a prophet and a magician, and soon a collection of oracular poems and some short divinatory texts, the so-called ""Oracles of Leo the Wise"", at least in part based on earlier Greek sources, were attached to the Emperor's name in later centuries and were believed to foretell the future of the world. Finally, Leo is credited with translating the relics of St. Lazarus to Constantinople in the year 890. There are several stichera (hymns) attributed to him that are chanted on Lazarus Saturday in the Eastern Orthodox Church. He also composed hymns that are sung on the Great Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. Family. By his first wife Theophano, Leo VI had one daughter: By his second wife, Zoe Zaoutzaina, Leo had one daughter: By his third wife, Eudokia Baïana, Leo had one son: By his fourth wife, Zoe Karbonopsina, Leo had two children: "
wikipedia-1223603," Sisowath Sirik Matak  Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak ( : January 22, 1914 — April 21, 1975) was a member of the Cambodian royal family, the Varman dynasty, under the House of Sisowath.  Sirik Matak was mainly notable for his involvement in Cambodian politics, particularly for his involvement in the 1970 right-wing coup against his cousin, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and for his subsequent establishment, along with Lon Nol, of the Khmer Republic. Involvement in Politics in Cambodia. Sirik Matak was born in Phnom Penh, and was a member of the Sisowath branch of the Varman Dynasty, being the great-grandson of Sisowath of Cambodia. He was recruited into the colonial civil service in 1930. Under the colonial French-imposed constitution, any member of the Norodom or Sisowath branches of the family could be selected as king, and Sirik Matak was therefore one of the possible contenders to the Cambodian throne. In 1941, after the death of King Sisowath Monivong, the French authorities selected Sirik Matak's cousin Norodom Sihanouk to be King, believing him to be relatively pliant. Sihanouk later accused Sirik Matak of harbouring a deep resentment against him, stating that he ""hated me from childhood days because he thought his uncle, Prince Sisowath Monireth, should have been placed on the throne instead of myself. He even had a notion that he himself should have been chosen"".  After the Second World War, Sirik Matak became increasingly involved in Cambodian politics. As a part of the right-wing Khmer Renovation party headed by Lon Nol, he took part in the National Assembly elections in 1947, though the party failed to win any seats. Sihanouk, then acting as Prime Minister, placed him in charge of defence in 1952, formally appointing him Minister of Defence in the interim government set up after independence in 1954; Sihanouk's Sangkum movement absorbed the Khmer Renovation Party prior to the Sangkum victory in the 1955 elections. Despite the incorporation of much of the right-wing opposition into the Sangkum, Sirik Matak remained an implacable opponent of Sihanouk, and especially of the latter's toleration of North Vietnamese activity within Cambodia's borders. Throughout the 1960s, Sihanouk attempted to minimize Sirik Matak's leverage on domestic politics by successively appointing him as Ambassador to China, the Philippines, and Japan. Cambodian coup of 1970. Sirik Matak's power increased substantially after Lon Nol became Prime Minister in August 1969. Appointed Lon Nol's deputy, he proceeded to organise a series of economic denationalisation and deregulation measures in opposition to Sihanouk's previous policy of state control of import and export, banking, and production of pharmaceuticals and alcohol. Sirik Matak even visited Hanoi secretly to find out what could be done to remove Vietnamese troops from Cambodian soil. He was infuriated when he was shown documents signed by Sihanouk agreeing to the establishment of Vietnamese bases and the transport of Vietnamese supplies through Cambodian ports. On March 12, 1970, while Sihanouk was on a trip abroad, Sirik Matak canceled Sihanouk's trade agreements and Lon Nol demanded that all North Vietnamese and NLF troops leave Cambodia by dawn on March 15 (the deadline passed without any response from the Vietnamese). On March 18, Sirik Matak assisted Lon Nol in organising a vote of the National Assembly to depose Sihanouk as head of state. The pretext was given by a series of anti-Vietnamese riots - likely encouraged by the Prime Minister and his deputy - in front of the North Vietnamese embassy. Foreign media subsequently suggested that Sirik Matak, who continued as Lon Nol's deputy in the new government, was the real organisational force behind the coup; it was claimed that in order to finally convince Lon Nol, Sirik Matak had played him a tape-recorded press conference from Paris, in which Sihanouk threatened to execute them both on his return to Phnom Penh. It was even reported that Sirik Matak compelled Lon Nol at gunpoint to commit to deposing Sihanouk. Sihanouk also assumed his cousin to be the main force behind the coup, claiming that Sirik Matak (backed by the CIA, and in contact with long-time Sihanouk opponent Son Ngoc Thanh) had already suggested the plan to Lon Nol as early as 1969. Sihanouk's suspicions seem to have rooted in fact: Prom Thos, one of Lon Nol's ministers, later told the historian Ben Kiernan that in around March 1969 Sirik Matak had argued that Sihanouk should be assassinated, Lon Nol rejecting the plan as ""criminal insanity"". With the declaration of the Khmer Republic subsequent to the coup, Sirik Matak renounced his royal title, although he had initially planned in secret that his own son, or another member of the Sisowath family, possibly his son-in-law Prince Sisowath Duongchivin, should take the throne.  Lon Nol's regime was complicit the massacre of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese residents in the period immediately after the takeover . There is evidence that Sirik Matak may have privately made efforts to halt these killings. In the government of the Khmer Republic. For the first year of the Republic, during which Lon Nol was often in poor health, Sirik Matak - as acting Premier - retained the most prominent role in the government. It had an overtly military character, Sirik Matak usually appearing in his full uniform as a Major-General and carrying a swagger stick. Whereas Lon Nol was particularly popular amongst anti-Sihanouk students in Cambodian cities, Sirik Matak had the support of the Westernised urban 'elite'; rural Cambodians remained overwhelmingly pro-Sihanouk. Sirik Matak also had relatively little personal support within the Cambodian political establishment; his power was gradually undermined by the Prime Minister's brother, Lon Non, and he resigned in 1972 after the latter had organised a series of demonstrations against him. Despite pressure from the United States, who were strong supporters of Sirik Matak, Lon Nol kept him under effective house arrest, and he became an increasingly vocal critic of the Khmer Republic regime. By April 1973, Lon Nol had been compelled to remove Lon Non and suspended the National Assembly, appointing a ""High Political Council"" composed of himself, Sirik Matak, Cheng Heng and In Tam. Privately, however, Sirik Matak stated that under the circumstances it would be preferable to allow Sihanouk to return, due to his levels of popular support, stating ""if the people wanted him, I would accept"". On being informed of this, an enraged Sihanouk called Sirik Matak ""one of the worst reactionaries and traitors of the history of Cambodia [...] we are going to hang him, quite simply hang him, hang him"". The fall of Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge communists initiated their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on January 1, 1975. On April 1, 1975, President Lon Nol resigned and fled the country into exile in Hawaii; the Khmer Rouge had published a 'death list' with his name at the top, and their forces had now surrounded the capital.  On April 12, 1975, United States's Ambassador to Cambodia John Gunther Dean, offered high officials of the Khmer Republic political asylum in the United States, but Sirik Matak, Long Boret and Lon Non, along with other members of Lon Nol's cabinet, declined - despite the names of Boret and Sirik Matak being published by the Khmer Rouge in a list of ""Seven Traitors"" marked down for execution. Sirik Matak's written response to the ambassador stated:  The letter was reproduced and added to the book Autrefois, Maison Privée.  Shortly after the official surrender of the Lon Nol government to the Khmer Rouge was announced, Sirik Matak sought refuge at the Hotel Le Phnom, where the International Red Cross was attempting to create a safe zone. He was turned away once the Red Cross learned that his name was on the list of ""Seven Traitors"". Outside the hotel, Sirik Matak talked to reporters and distributed copies of his letter to Ambassador Dean. Bizot reported that Sirik Matak sought political asylum at the French Embassy and that the Khmer Rouge threatened to come into the compound and remove certain individuals by force if they did not go voluntarily. Accompanied by the French Vice-Consul Jean Dyrac and journalist Jon Swain, Bizot took responsibility for informing Sirik Matak that he was to be handed over to the Khmer Rouge. Sirik Matak and the officials that remained along with him were likely executed by the Khmer Rouge on April 21, 1975.  The exact details of his death are unclear, but Sihanouk received confirmation that Sirik Matak, along with Long Boret, had been summarily executed by firing squad at the Phnom Penh ""Cercle Sportif"" on April 21; other reports state he was beheaded. Henry Kissinger and others, however, note a report that Sirik Matak was shot in the stomach and left without medical aid to die over three days. Sirik Matak was married to Princess Norodom Kethneari; his son Prince Sisowath Sirirath (1946-) is currently one of the leaders of the royalist FUNCINPEC political party. "
wikipedia-867736," Anatolian beyliks  Anatolian beyliks, or Turkmen beyliks (, Ottoman Turkish: ""Tevâif-i mülûk"", ""Beylik"" ) were small Turkish principalities governed by Beys, which were founded across Anatolia at the end of the 11th century in a first period, and more extensively during the decline of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm during the second half of the 13th century.  The word ""beylik"" denotes the territory under the jurisdiction of a Bey, roughly translated ""Lord"". Aside from its Anatolian context, the term is also used with reference to the 16th century Ottoman governmental institutions in the largely autonomous regencies along the coastline of present-day Tunisia and Algeria. History. Following the 1071 Seljuq victory over the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Manzikert and the subsequent conquest of Anatolia, Oghuz clans began settling in present-day Turkey. The Seljuq Sultanate's central power established in Konya employed these clans especially in border areas, in order to ensure safety against the Byzantines, under Beys called ""uç beyi"" or ""uj begi"" (""uç"" is a Turkish term for a border territory; cf. marches) (Thus ""uç beyi"" is similar to margrave in Europe). These clans, led by beys, would receive military and financial aid from the Seljuqs in return for their services, and acted as if owing full allegiance to their sovereignty.  However, with the Mongol invasions from the east, the Seljuq power deteriorated and instead Ilkhanate commanders in Anatolia gained strength and authority, which encouraged the beys to declare sovereignty openly. Following the fall of the centralized power in Konya, many Beys joined forces with the atabegs (former Seljuq leaders) and other religious Muslim leaders and warriors from Persia and Turkistan fleeing the Mongols, invading the Byzantine empire where they established emirates. To maintain control of their new territory, these reestablished emirs employed Ghazi warriors from Persia and Turkistan who also fled the Mongols. The ghazis fought under the inspiration of either a mullah or a general, trying to assert Islamic power, their assaults of the reestablished emirs upon the Byzantine Empire reaching even further expanded the power sphere of the beyliks.  When the Byzantine empire weakened, their cities in Asia Minor could resist the assaults of the beyliks less and less, and eventually many Turks settled in western parts of Anatolia. As a result, many more beyliks were founded in these newly conquered western regions who entered into power struggles with the Byzantines, the Genoese, the Knights Templar as well as between each other. By 1300, Turks had reached the Aegean coastline, held momentarily two centuries before. In the beginning, the most powerful states were the Karamanids and the Germiyanids in the central area. The Beylik of Osmanoğlu Dynasty who were later to found the Ottoman Empire was situated to the northwest, around Söğüt, and was a small and at that stage, insignificant power. Along the Aegean coast, from north to south, stretched Karasids, Sarukhanids, Aydinids, Menteşe and Teke principalities. The Jandarids (later called Isfendiyarids) controlled the Black Sea region round Kastamonu and Sinop. Under its eponymous founder, Osman I, the Beylik of Osmanoğlu expanded at Byzantine expense south and west of the Sea of Marmara in the first decades of the 14th century. With their annexation of the neighboring Beylik of Karasi and their advance into Roumelia as of 1354, they soon became strong enough to emerge as the main rivals of Karamanids, who at that time were thought to be the strongest. Towards the end of the 14th century, the Ottomans advanced further into Anatolia by acquiring towns, either by buying them off or through marriage alliances. Meanwhile the Karamanids assaulted the Ottomans many times with the help of other beyliks, Mamluks, Aq Qoyunlu (White Sheep Turkomans) (""White Sheep"") Turkmens, Byzantines, Pontics and Hungarians, failing and losing power every time. By the close of the century, the early Ottoman leaders had conquered large parts of land from Karamanids and other less prominent beyliks. These had a short respite when their territories were restored to them after the Ottoman defeat suffered against Tamerlane in 1402 in the Battle of Ankara.  But the Ottoman state quickly collected itself under Mehmed I and his son Murad II re-incorporated most of these beyliks into Ottoman territory in a space of around 25 years. The final blow for the Karamanids was struck by Mehmed II who conquered their lands and re-assured a homogeneous rule in Anatolia. The further steps towards a single rule by the Ottomans were taken by Selim I who conquered territories of Ramadanids and Dulkadirids in 1515 during his campaign against the Mamluks, and his son Süleyman the Magnificent who more or less completely united the present territories of Turkey (and much more) in his 1534 campaign. Many of the former Anatolian beyliks became the basis for administrative subdivisions in the Ottoman Empire. List of the Anatolian beyliks founded after the Battle of Manzikert. In the list below, only the beyliks that were founded immediately after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, mostly situated towards the Eastern Anatolia, and who were vassals (or sometimes at war) to the centralized power of Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm based in Konya are listed. Founded after the Battle of Malazgirt: List of the Anatolian beyliks founded after the Battle of Köse Dağ. A second group beyliks that emerged as a result of the weakening of this central state under the Mongol blow with the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243 which had the indirect consequence of extending the Turkish aire in Western Anatolia toward the end of the 13th century. Founded after the Battle of Köse Dağ: Language and legacy. Combined with the Seljuqs and the immigration of Turkic tribes into the Anatolian mainland the Anatolian Beyliks spread Turkish and Islamic influence in Anatolia. Unlike the Seljuqs, whose language of administration was Persian, the Anatolian emirates adopted spoken Turkish as their formal literary language.  The Turkish language achieved widespread use in these principalities and reached its highest sophistication during the Ottoman era. Art. In spite of their limited sources and the political climate of their era, art during the Anatolian beyliks flourished, probably building the basis for Ottoman art. Although the artistic style of the Anatolian beyliks can be considered as representatives of a transition period between Seljuks and Ottomans, new trends were also acquired. Especially wandering traditional crafts artists and architects helped spread these new trends and localized styles to several beyliks across Anatolia, which resulted in innovative and original works particularly in architectur]. Wood and stone carving, clay tiles and other similar decorative arts of the Seljuqs were still used, however with the influence of the pursuit for new spaces and its reflections in other arts as well. Some representative examples of the Anatolian beyliks' architecture are İlyas Bey Mosque at Balat (Milet) (1404), ""İsabey Mosque"" at Selçuk (1375), ""Ulucami Mosque"" at Birgi (1312) built by the Aydın beylik. The above mosques, although being successors of Seljuq architecture, differ greatly in the increase of decorations in the interior and exterior spaces and the different placement of the courtyards and minarets. Karaman beylik also left noteworthy architectural works, such as ""Ulucami Mosque"" in Ermenek (1302), ""Hatuniye Madrassa"" in Karaman (1382), ""Akmedrese Madrassa"" in Niğde (1409), all of which respect a new style that considers and incorporates the exterior surroundings also. One of the first examples of the Anatolian beylik architecture hinting at the forming of the Ottoman architecture that aims at uniting the interior space beneath one big dome and forming a monumental architectural structure is ""Ulucami Mosque"" in Manisa (1374) built by the Saruhan beylik. Also worth noting is the increase in constructions of madrassas that points at the beyliks' attaching greater importance to sciences. "

wikipedia-171272," East Coast hip hop  East Coast hip hop is a regional subgenre of hip hop music that originated in New York City, USA during the 1970s. Hip hop is recognized to have originated and evolved first in the East Coast. The style in the East Coast emerged as a definitive subgenre after artists from other regions of the United States emerged with different styles. Musical style. In contrast to the simplistic rhyme pattern and scheme utilized in old school hip hop, East Coast hip hop has been noted for its emphasis on lyrical dexterity. It has also been characterized by multi-syllabic rhymes, complex wordplay, a continuous free-flowing delivery and intricate metaphors. While East Coast hip hop does not have a uniform sound or standard style, it tends to gravitate to aggressive beats and sample collages. The aggressive and hard-hitting beats of the form were emphasized by such acts as EPMD and Public Enemy, while artists such as Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions, Big Daddy Kane and Slick Rick were noted for their lyrical skill. Lyrical themes throughout the history of East Coast hip hop have ranged from lyrical consciousness by such artists as Public Enemy and A Tribe Called Quest to mafioso rap themes by rappers such as Raekwon and Kool G Rap. History. Emergence of hip hop on the East Coast (1970–1980s). East coast hip hop is occasionally referred to as New York rap due to its origins and development at block parties thrown in New York City during the 1970s. According to Allmusic, ""At the dawn of the hip-hop era, all rap was East Coast rap."" Early artists of the form, including DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, the Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, Jam Master Jay, and Run-D.M.C., pioneered East Coast hip hop during hip hop's development. As the genre developed, lyrical themes evolved through the work of East Coast artists such as the Native Tongues, a collective of hip hop artists associated with generally positive, Afrocentric themes, and assembled by Afrika Bambaataa. New York-based groups such as De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and the Jungle Brothers also earned recognition for their musical eclecticism. The East Coast Renaissance (early to mid–1990s). Although East Coast hip hop was more popular throughout the late 1980s, N.W.A's ""Straight Outta Compton"" presented the toughened sound of West Coast hip hop, which was accompanied by gritty, street-level subject matter. Later in 1992, Dr. Dre's G-Funk record ""The Chronic"" would introduce West Coast hip hop to the mainstream. Along with a combined ability to retain its primary function as party music, the West Coast form of hip hop became a dominant force during the early 1990s. Although G-Funk was the most popular variety of hip hop during the early 1990s, the East Coast hip hop scene remained an integral part of the music industry. During this period, several New York City rappers rising from the local underground scene, began releasing noteworthy albums in the early and mid nineties. Black Moon's 1993 debut, ""Enta Da Stage"", was one of the first major recordings to emerge out of New York's hardcore hip hop scene. The album has been credited with helping spark trends that would later come to characterize this period in East Coast hip hop, and marked an early appearance for the rap supergroup Boot Camp Clik .  Nas's 1994 debut album ""Illmatic"" has also been noted as a creative high point of the East Coast hip hop scene, and featured production from such renowned New York-based producers as Large Professor, Pete Rock and DJ Premier. Meanwhile, The Wu-Tang Clan and Mobb Deep became pillars in New York's hardcore hip hop scene, achieving widespread critical acclaim for their landmark albums, ""Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)"" (1993) and ""The Infamous"" (1995) and spawning legions of imitators . Adam Hemleich comments on the collective impact of these emerging artists: ""Along with Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Mobb Deep all but invented 90s New York rap [...] Those three...designed the manner and style in which New York artists would address...rap’s hottest topics: drugs and violence.""  The Notorious B.I.G. became the central figure in East Coast hip hop during most of the 1990s. His success on the music charts and rise to the mainstream drew more attention to New York at the time of West Coast hip hop's dominance. According to Allmusic editor Steve Huey, the success of his 1994 debut album ""Ready to Die"" ""reinvented East Coast rap for the gangsta age"" and ""turned the Notorious B.I.G. into a hip-hop sensation — the first major star the East Coast had produced since the rise of Dr. Dre's West Coast G-funk"". His commercial success helped pave the way for the success of other East Coast rappers such as Jay-Z and Nas. Legacy. Many hip hop aficionados look favorably upon this period as a time of creative growth and influential recordings, describing it as ""The East Coast Renaissance."" Music writer May Blaize of MVRemix Urban comments on the nostalgia felt among hip hop fans for records released during this time:  David Drake of Stylus Magazine writes of hip hop during 1994 and its contributions, stating: ""The beats were hot, the rhymes were hot - it really was an amazing time for hip-hop and music in general. This was the critical point for the East Coast, a time when rappers from the New York area were releasing bucketloads of thrilling work - Digable Planets, Gang Starr, Pete Rock, Jeru, O.C., Organized Konfusion - I mean, this was a year of serious music. Gabe Gloden of Stylus Magazine later wrote, ""From my perspective in the Midwest, the market was dominated by West Coast hip hop, and these albums didn’t make much of a dent in West Coast sales, but with time, these albums filtered their way into everyone’s collections.""

The intention of an electrical code is to provide standards to ensure electrical wiring systems that are safe and unlikely to produce either electric shock or fires. Ways in which electrical codes ensure safety include ways to prevent (or mitigate) short circuits, ground faults, and overheating from inadequate current-carrying capacity (ampacity). Appropriately rated fuses or circuit breakers are used to interrupt a circuit loop whose ampacity is exceeded to avoid overheating of wires or other fixtures. Electrical codes are usually devised by national or international technical organizations, and adopted as law to make them enforceable. Electrical codes differ based on geographic area.

wikipedia-4971453," Tigertailz  Tigertailz are a glam metal band hailing from Cardiff, Wales. They are most famous for their 1990 album, ""Bezerk"" which made the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart, with hit singles ""Love Bomb Baby"" and the ballad ""Heaven"", and spawned a couple of successful singles. The band reformed in 2005 to considerable popular acclaim. Formation and early years. Tigertailz (originally called Stagefright) formed in 1983 after bassist Pepsi Tate and drummer Ian Welch placed an advert in the Cardiff record store, Spillers Records, looking for a guitarist. Jay Pepper answered the advert. Local guitarist Phil Harling and singer Jim Dovey joined and the band began to write and record demos, although the demos were never released. The band began to get gigs and they started to amass a local following, however lead singer Jim Dovey soon left the band therefore Pepper and Tate placed an advert in the ""National Sounds"" magazine and vocalist Steevi Jaimz answered the call and joined the band. Welch left the band in 1984 and was finally replaced with Ace Finchum. Commercial success (1987-1995). Part of the nascent glam metal scene in the late 1980s, Tigertailz first line-up issued their debut album, ""Young And Crazy"", in 1987. The album featured vocalist Steevi Jaimz, guitarist Jay Pepper, bassist Pepsi Tate and drummer Ace Finchum. The debut album also provided their first single, ""Livin' Without You"". As the band toured, vocalist Steevi Jaimz was not fully committed to the band, and several instances of fighting were recorded. The band recruited Kim Hooker to replace Jaimz in time for follow-up album, ""Bezerk"" which was released in 1990 on the Music For Nations label. Prior to the release of ""Bezerk"", the band re-recorded ""Livin Without' You"" with Hooker as vocalist, and released it as a single. ""Bezerk"" saw the band breakthrough as a headline act, and delivering three singles, ""Love Bomb Baby"", ""Noise Level Critical"" and ""Heaven"". The album peaked at No. 36 in the UK Albums Chart. They released ""Banzai!"", a collection of B-sides and re-recorded tracks, in 1991 in Japan. They also issued ""Wazbones"" in 1995, by which time the Hooker-Pepper-Tate-Finchum line-up had fragmented, and was replaced by the Hooker-Danahar-Tate-Skinner line up. Touring proved successful, but there was insufficient record label interest to sustain the band. Reunion (2005-2009). In 2005, the band reformed their classic line-up, with the addition of former City Kidds drummer Matt Blakout, who replaced Andy Skinner. The band won a court order winning ownership of the Tigertailz name from a spin-off band fronted by Steevi Jaimz. This problem resolved, Tigertailz were able to work on ""Bezerk 2.0"".  They completed a short reunion tour of the UK, culminating in some festival dates in Sweden and Spain, playing to over 70,000 people with Whitesnake and Twisted Sister. ""Kerrang!"" magazine wrote in praise of the reunion; journalist Steve Beebee describing it as ""persistently entertaining, with monstrous melodies that reach delirious peaks"". ""Bezerk 2.0"" was released through Demolition Records on 7 August 2006. Bass player Pepsi Tate was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007. The band signed a new recording contract with Sanctuary Records, and released ""Thrill Pistol"" on 27 August 2007, barely a year after their previous album release. This release was a double album, packaged with the original 1992 version of the ""Wazbones"" album, that had never been officially released. Beebee again wrote in praise of the album in ""Kerrang!"", calling on fans to ""kindly hail this rejuvenated band for the time-defying devils they are"". Following Tate's death in September 2007, Tigertailz continued to tour with former City Kidds lead guitarist, Glenn 'Nailz' Quinn, playing bass. As well as numerous European festival shows, they supported ex-Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley in the UK, and performed at the UK's Hard Rock Hell Festival in both 2008 and 2009. Bezerk anniversary (2010). In January 2010, Tigertailz recruited Sarah Firebrand as their new bass player. They also announced that they would be playing ""Bezerk"", originally released in 1990, in its entirety and in sequence at some subsequent live shows. Some of these performances were recorded for use as a future live album. After playing a show at the Fuel Rock Club in Cardiff on 17 April to raise money for the Amser Justin Time charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory, the band headlined the Stockholm Rock Out Festival in Sweden on May 1. Following further 'Bezerk Live' dates, Tigertailz replaced drummer Matt Blakout with former Rachel Stamp sticksman Robin Guy. Tigertailz headlined the first night of 2010's Hard Rock Hell and released ""Bezerk Live - Burnin' Fuel"" on 6 December. In June 2011, it was announced, via the band's website, that Ace Finchum had re-joined the band.  They were expected to record their next studio album in 2011, but on November 23 in an interview with Queens Of Steel webzine [ Queens Of Steel - Tigertailz interview ] Jay Pepper cast doubt on the future of the band, stating that it was ""facing a crossroads as to its survival. I don't know if we can survive the latest troubles."" Suggesting that Tigertailz might still continue ""with a different line-up"" the band officially parted company with Sarah Firebrand on January 9, 2012 [ ]. Frontman Kim Hooker went the same way on March 28, 2012, the remaining members citing 'a total breakdown of relationship resulting from the singer's unprofessional conduct'[ ]. They further described themselves as ""relieved"". New Line-up (2012). On June 26, 2012, Tigertailz announced its new line-up, and a European tour for September and October. Joining original members Jay Pepper and Ace Finchum were Jules Millis (vocals), Rob Wylde (guitar) and Jason Sims (bass). The band re-recorded an old song, Fall In Love Again, and filmed a video for it - with all proceeds going towards a charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory.  After a tour and an appearance at the Hard Rock Hell festival, this line-up fragmented in 2013. In a statement on the band's website, Jay Pepper confirmed that there would be no reunion but that he would continue to perform as Tigertailz, and in June 2013 it was confirmed that drummer Matthew Blakout had re-joined the band, with a new EP 'Knives' being prepared for release.

wikipedia-951941," Great Britain national rugby league team  The Great Britain national rugby league team represents the United Kingdom in rugby league football. Administered by the Rugby Football League (RFL), the team is nicknamed ""The Lions"" or ""Great Britain Lions"". In 2006, the RFL announced that after the 2007 All Golds Tour the Great Britain team would no longer compete on a regular basis, and that players would be able to represent England, Wales and Scotland at Test level. It is planned that the Great Britain team will come together in future only for occasional tours. Competitions. Great Britain were one of the strongest teams in rugby league, though usually playing second fiddle to Australia. They won the Rugby League World Cup on three occasions: 1954, 1960 and 1972. Since 1995 the RFL have preferred to send the home nations as separate teams for World Cup purposes. Great Britain continued to compete as a test playing nation both home and away (unlike the British and Irish Lions rugby union team, who are a touring team that play every four years). They competed against Australia for the Ashes, and New Zealand for the Baskerville Shield, as well the Tri-Nations series with both Australia and New Zealand. Great Britain also played in series and tours against other nations such as France, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. Titles, selection and identity. The team was originally known as the ""Northern Union XIII"" in reference to the name of the sport's governing body. After 1922 the name ""the Lions"" was first used. In 1948 the team became known as ""Great Britain"" for the Ashes Series. During the 1990s the Rugby Football League expanded this to ""Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", and the jersey bore the name ""British Isles XIII"". In 2004 the words """"...and Northern Ireland"""" were dropped from the title, though the Irish shamrock continued to form part of the RFL's crest and ""British Isles XIII"" remained on the jersey. At matches, the team was represented by the Union Flag and the singing of God Save the Queen, both symbols of the United Kingdom. The practice of a UK-wide team being called ""Great Britain"" has a precedent with the Great British Olympic team, though the formal name of the Olympic team includes ""and Northern Ireland"". The team continued to compete until the 2007 All Golds Tour: henceforth, the Great Britain team will now be reserved for Lions tours of the Southern Hemisphere. According to Richard Lewis, chairman of the Rugby Football League: History. Initially Great Britain were represented by a team made up of players from the Northern Rugby Football Union, known simply as the ""Northern Union"" side. Their first ever match was a win against a touring New Zealand side in January, 1908. The following season Great Bitain played host to the Australian side. The Northern Union's first match against the Kangaroos was a 22-all draw. In June, 1910 the Northern Union embarked on its successful first tour of Australasia. Great Britain defeated a touring Australian side 2-1 in the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. The team travelled to Australia again on the HMS Indomitable in 1946 for the first post-war tour. In 1954 the first ever Rugby League World Cup was held in France and Great Britain were the winners. They came second in the 1957 World Cup in Australia and history was made when the returning French and British squads visited South Africa and played a series of exhibition matches in Benoni, Durban and East London, all of which were won by the British. The Lions won the next World Cup in 1960. In 2002 Great Britain suffered their worst-ever defeat at the hands of the Australians when they went down 64-10 in Sydney. More recently, Great Britain enjoyed a three nil series whitewash of the touring New Zealand side in the 2007 All Golds tour. "
wikipedia-563579," Choking Victim  Choking Victim was a United States punk rock band formed in New York City, which lasted from 1992 to 1999. They played a mix of hardcore punk and ska (known as ska-core). Following the breakup of the band, which occurred the same day as the recording of their only studio album ""No Gods, No Managers"", members went on to form Leftöver Crack. Background. The band became well-known at the C-Squat in the Lower East Side of Manhattan for their innovative music and politically charged lyrics. They also became infamous for their Satanic imagery and references to the vagrant lifestyle, including smoking both crack cocaine and marijuana, shoplifting, and squatting. The band prides itself on its atheism, making reference to Satan for the purpose of being offensive, rather than any actual worship of the deity. On the album ""No Gods, No Managers"", they use excerpts from the lectures of political scientist Michael Parenti. Breakup. Choking Victim broke up after the first day of recording for their first full-length LP, ""No Gods, No Managers"", but the recordings from that one day were enough to make a full album. After they broke up, (Stza and Ezra Crack) formed the band Leftöver Crack, and Skwert and Ezra formed INDK. Skwert is currently the front man for the NJ based ska punk band Public Serpents. Sascha has spent the last several years organically farming in upstate NY, and is a founding member of Icarus Project, a radical mental health network. Choking Victim and Leftöver Crack are anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic and anti-fascist. Reunions. On November 11, 2000, Choking Victim reunited to play a show in Tompkins Square Park with the lineup from their album, substituting former bassist Alec for Shayne. Later, in late 2005, Choking Victim reunited a second time, performing four shows. On June 11, 2006, they played a show at the Lower East Side's Tompkins Square Park, which featured various political speakers, including members of the Mislead Youth Project. At the end of July 2006, they toured the Dominican Republic, before Leftöver Crack embarked on their European Tour. In the Summer of 2012, lead singer Stza enlisted the help of Irish Ska/Punk band Chewing on Tinfoil and formed ""The Choking Victim Show"". This band, playing the songs of Choking Victim, toured throughout the UK, Ireland and France Legacy. In addition to Leftöver Crack and INDK, Choking Victim also spawned Morning Glory and the Crack Rock Steady 7. Choking Victim have reformed for a few dates in the UK and Europe as The Choking Victim Show with Stza, Sascha, Alec and Ezra. Discography. EP's (Vinyl): Albums: Demos: Compilation Releases: Live: "

Tavernier was born in Lyon, the son of Geneviève (née Dumond) and René Tavernier, a publicist and writer, several years president of the French PEN club. He says that his father's publishing of a wartime resistance journal and aid to anti-Nazi intellectuals shaped his moral outlook as an artist. According to Tavernier, his father believed that words were ""as important and as lethal as bullets”. Tavernier wanted to become a filmmaker since the age of 13 or 14 years. He claims that his cinematic influences include filmmakers John Ford, William Wellman, Jean Renoir, Jean Vigo and Jacques Becker. Tavernier was influenced by the 1968 general strike in France. He associated with the OCI between 1973 and 1975, and was particularly struck by the writing of Leon Trotsky. The first film director with whom he worked was Jean-Pierre Melville. Later, his first film (""The Clockmaker"", 1974) won the Prix Louis Delluc and the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize award at the 24th Berlin International Film Festival. His early work was dominated by mysteries, but his later work is characterized by a more overt social commentary, highlighting his left-wing views (""Life and Nothing But"", ""Capitaine Conan"") and presenting a critical picture of contemporary French society (""Ça commence aujourd'hui"", """").

Their daughter, Tiffany Tavernier (born in 1967), is a novelist, screenwriter and assistant director. "
wikipedia-970642," Portuguese people  The Portuguese () are a Western Romance nation and ethnic group native to the country of Portugal, in the west of the Iberian Peninsula of Southwestern Europe. Their language is Portuguese, and Roman Catholicism is their predominant religion. Historically, the Portuguese descend from the Pre-Celts who inhabited the Iberian Peninsula with the Lusitanians forming the manifold identity of the country, followed by the Romans. Other major segments include the Suebi, the Visigoths and the Gallaeci. Due to the large historical extent of the Portuguese Empire and the colonization of territories in Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as historical and recent emigration, Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe, and a large Portuguese diaspora exists. Ancestry. Historical origins. The Portuguese are a Southwestern European population, with origins predominantly from Atlantic Europe, Western Europe and the Western Mediterranean. At foundation, the Portuguese, like other population groups from the western and central regions of the Iberian Peninsula, are an Atlantic Celtic people who have been very substantially ""Romanized"" over time. The earliest modern humans inhabiting Portugal are believed to have been Paleolithic peoples that may have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula as early as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Current interpretation of Y-chromosome and mtDNA data suggests that modern-day Portuguese trace a significant amount of these lineages to the paleolithic peoples who began settling the European continent between the end of the last glaciation around 45,000 years ago. Northern Iberia is believed to have been a major Ice-age refuge from which Paleolithic humans later colonized Europe. Migrations from what is now Northern Iberia during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic, links modern Iberians to the populations of much of Western Europe and particularly the British Isles and Atlantic Europe. Recent books published by geneticists Bryan Sykes, Stephen Oppenheimer and Spencer Wells have argued the large Paleolithic and Mesolithic Iberian influence in the modern day Irish, Welsh and Scottish gene-pool as well as parts of the English. Indeed, Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b (of Paleolithic origin) is the most common haplogroup in practically all of the Iberian peninsula and western Europe. Within the R1b haplogroup there are modal haplotypes. One of the best-characterized of these haplotypes is the Atlantic Modal Haplotype (AMH). This haplotype reaches the highest frequencies in the Iberian Peninsula and in the British Isles. In Portugal it reckons generally 60% in the South summing 80% northwards, and in some regions 90%. The Neolithic colonization of Europe from Western Asia and the Middle East beginning around 10,000 years ago reached Iberia, as most of the rest of the continent although, according to the demic diffusion model, its impact was most in the southern and eastern regions of the European continent. Starting in the 3rd millennium BC as well as in the Bronze Age, the first wave of migrations into Iberia of speakers of Indo-European languages occurred. These were later (7th and 5th Centuries BC) followed by others that can be identified as Celts. Eventually, urban cultures developed in southern Iberia, such as Tartessos, influenced by the Phoenician colonization of coastal Mediterranean Iberia, with strong competition from the Greek colonization. These two processes defined Iberia's, and Portugal's, cultural landscape - Mediterranean towards the southeast and a Continental in the northwest, as historian José Mattoso describes it. Given the origins from Paleolithic and Neolithic settlers as well as Indo-European migrations, one can say that the Portuguese ethnic origin is mainly a mixture of pre-Roman Pre-Indo-Europeans (such as, in other parts of Iberia, the Iberians, Tartessians and Aquitanians), Pre-Celtic, Proto-Celtic and Celtic peoples, producing peoples such as the Lusitanians of Lusitania, the Calaicians or Gallaeci of Gallaecia, the Celtici and the Cynetes of the Alentejo and the Algarve. The Romans were also an important influence on Portuguese culture, from which Portuguese language itself derives from, Latin. Other minor influences included the Phoenicians/Carthaginians (small semi-permanent commercial coastal establishments in the south before 200 BC), the Vandals (Silingi and Hasdingi) and the Sarmatian Alans (both migrated to North Africa, while some were partially integrated by the Visigoths and Suebi), and the Visigoths and Suebi (including the Buri, permanently established in the early 5th century), Saqaliba (people of Slavic origin), who also settled in what is today Portuguese territory. The ancestry of modern Portuguese has been influenced by the many people which have passed on its territory throughout history. Overall, these people include the Pre-Roman People of the Iberian Peninsula (such as the Lusitanians, Calaicians, Celtici, Cynetes and other minor local tribes as the Bracari, Coelerni, Equaesi, Grovii, Interamici, Leuni, Luanqui, Limici, Narbasi, Nemetati, Paesuri, Quaquerni, Seurbi, Tamagani, Tapoli, Turduli, Turduli Veteres, Turdulorum Oppida, Turodi and Zoelae), and probably for some cases Romans, Vandals, Suebi and Buri, Visigoths, Vikings, Alans and Saqaliba. Most Berber/Arab Muslim, native Portuguese (Iberian) Muslims, and Jews were expelled from the Iberian Peninsula during the Reconquista, by the repression of persecutions of the Inquisition and the re-population of Christians, with many crusaders settling in Portugal. Settlers also came from Burgundy and Flanders, settling in mainland Portugal and later in the archipelagos of Azores and Madeira (Descobrimentos). For the Y-chromosome and MtDNA lineages of the Portuguese and other peoples see this map and this one. According to studies, more than 55% of the Portuguese population is straight descendant of Celts. Portuguese people have also maintained a certain degree of cultural and ethnic-specific characteristics ratio with the Basques, since ancient times. The results of the present HLA study in Portuguese populations show that they have features in common with Basques and Spaniards from Madrid: a high frequency of the HLA-haplotypes A29-B44-DR7 (ancient western Europeans) and A1-B8-DR3 are found as common characteristics. Portuguese and Basques do not show the Mediterranean A33-B14-DR1 haplotype, suggesting a lower admixture with Mediterraneans. The Portuguese have a characteristic unique among world populations: a high frequency of HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13, which may reflect a still detectable founder effect coming from ancient Portuguese, i.e., Oestriminis and Conii. The Lusitanians. The Lusitanians (or Lusitānus/Lusitani in Latin) were an Indo-European speaking people living in the Western Iberian Peninsula long before it became the Roman province of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca). They spoke the Lusitanian language, of which only a few short written fragments survive. Culturally, whether or not the Lusitanians should be classified as Celtic is disputed by scholars but their language contained many Celtic influences and they did share some major cultural elements with the neighboring Gallaecia to the north and the Celtiberians to the east. Most Portuguese consider the Lusitanians as their ancestors. The most notable Lusitanian was Viriathus. People from Portugal's northern regions (Minho, Douro, Tras-os-Montes) identify more with the Gallaecian Celts. It has been hypothesized that the Lusitanians may have originated in the Alps and settled in the region in the 6th century BC. Some modern scholars consider them to be indigenous and initially dominated by the Celts, before gaining full independence from them. The archeologist Scarlat Lambrino proposed that they were originally a tribal group of Celtic origin related to the Lusones. The first area settled by the Lusitanians was probably the Douro valley and the region of Beira Alta; then they moved south, and expanded on both sides of the Tagus river, before being conquered by the Romans. The original Roman province of Lusitania was extended north of the areas occupied by the Lusitanians to include the territories of Asturias and Gallaecia but these were soon ceded to the jurisdiction of the ""Provincia Tarraconensis"" in the north, while the south remained the ""Provincia Lusitania et Vettones"". After this, Lusitania's northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through ""Salmantica"" and ""Caesarobriga"" to the ""Anas"" (Guadiana) river. Pre-Roman groups. The Lusitanians were a single large tribe that lived between the rivers Douro and Tagus. As the Lusitanians fought fiercely against the Romans for independence, the name Lusitania was adopted by the Gallaeci, tribes living north of the Douro, and other closely surrounding tribes, eventually spreading as a label to all the nearby peoples fighting Roman rule in the west of Iberia. It was for this reason that the Romans came to name their original province in the area, that initially covered the entire western side of the Iberian peninsula, Lusitania. Tribes, often known by their Latin names, living in the area of modern Portugal, prior to Roman rule: Romanization. Since 193 BC, the Lusitanians had been fighting the Romans. In 150 BC, they were defeated by Praetor Servius Galba: springing a clever trap, he killed 9,000 Lusitanians and later sold 20,000 more as slaves in Gaul (modern France). Three years later (147 BC), Viriathus became the leader of the Lusitanians and severely damaged the Roman rule in Lusitania and beyond. In 139 BC Viriathus was betrayed and killed in his sleep by his companions (who had been sent as emissaries to the Romans), Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus, bribed by Marcus Popillius Laenas. However, when Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus returned to receive their reward by the Romans, the Consul Servilius Caepio ordered their execution, declaring, ""Rome does not pay traitors"". After Viriathus' rule, the Lusitanians became largely romanized, adopting Roman Culture and Language. The Lusitanian cities, in a manner similar to those of the rest of the Roman-Iberian peninsula, eventually gained the status of ""Citizens of Rome"". The Portuguese language itself is a local evolution of the Roman language, Latin. General traits. Modern Portuguese are an Iberian ethnic group and their ancestry is very similar to other western and southern European peoples, particularly from Spain, with whom they share ancestry and have some cultural proximity. It is largely consistent with the geographic position of the western part of the Iberian peninsula, located on the extreme southwest of continental Europe. There are clear connections with Atlantic Europe and Western Europe as well as parts of the Western Mediterranean. Dark to medium brown hair and brown and hazel eyes predominate in a majority of Portuguese people. However, light brown and blond hair and blue or green eyes are also found with some regular frequency. Chestnut and auburn-colored hair types occur generally. Light, true red hair (meaning red shades that are non-auburn) is seen on occasion. Well designed pigmentation field studies by Tamagnini (1916, 1936), Correa (1919) and others recorded national average fair hair (""blondism"") frequencies of between 18 and 20%. Approximately 11% are legitimate blond shades, mainly medium to ash blond, and the remainder (7-9%) light brown. True red hair (ginger) amounts to approximately 3%. However, there are higher percentages of individuals with auburn and dark red-brown shades. Light eyes run between 20-49% for the Portuguese, according to recently published pigmentation maps of Europe (see P. Frost, 2006). Nonetheless studies dating back from 1916 to 1936 are not likely to prove its relevance due to methodological scientific incongruencies and Eusébio Tamagnini being known for his stand on eugenics and phrenology. Demography. Demographics of Portugal. There are around 10.2 million native Portuguese in Portugal, out of a total population of 10.75 million (estimate). Native minority languages in Portugal. A small minority of about 15,000 speak the Mirandese language, close to Leonese in the municipalities of Miranda do Douro, Vimioso and Mogadouro. All of the speakers are bilingual with Portuguese. An even smaller minority of no more than 2,000 people speak Barranquenho, a dialect of Portuguese heavily influenced by Extremaduran, spoken in the Portuguese town of Barrancos (in the border between Extremadura and Andalusia, in Spain, and Portugal). Ethnic minorities in Portugal. People from the former colonies (namely Brazil, Africa - Afro-Portuguese, and parts of India) have, in the last two to three decades, migrated to Portugal. More recently, a great number of Slavs, especially Ukrainians (now the third biggest ethnic minority), are also migrating to Portugal. There is also a small Chinese minority. In addition, there is a small minority Gypsies (""Ciganos"") of about 40,000 people, Muslims about 34,000 people and an even smaller minority of Jews of about 5,000 persons (some Ashkenazi, the majority Sephardi, such as the Belmonte Jews). The Portuguese diaspora. In the whole world there are easily more than one hundred million people with recognizable Portuguese ancestors, due to the colonial expansion and worldwide immigration of Portuguese from the 16th century onwards to India, the Americas, Macau (see Macanese people), East-Timor, Malaysia, Indonesia and Africa. Between 1886 and 1966, Portugal lost to emigration more than any West European country except Ireland. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two million Portuguese left Europe to live in Brazil and the United States. About 40 million Brazilians have relatively recent Portuguese background, due to massive immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. About 1.2 million Brazilian citizens are native Portuguese. Significant verified Portuguese minorities exist in: (see table) Portuguese Sephardic Jews (mostly descendants) are also important in Israel, the Netherlands, the United States, France, Venezuela, Brazil and Turkey. In the United States, there are Portuguese communities in New Jersey, the New England states, and California. In the Pacific, Hawaii has a sizable Portuguese element that goes back 150 years (see Portuguese Americans and Luso Americans), Australia and New Zealand also have Portuguese communities (see Portuguese Australian, Portuguese New Zealander). Canada, particularly Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, has developed a significant Portuguese community since 1940 (see Portuguese Canadians). Argentina (See Portuguese Argentine and Cape Verdean Argentine) and Uruguay had Portuguese immigration in the early 20th century. So has Chile where an estimated 50,000 descendants live, as the country's maritime industries attracted a small number of Portuguese as well. . Portuguese fishermen, farmers and laborers dispersed across the Caribbean, especially Bermuda (3.75% to 10% of the population), Guyana (4.3% of the population in 1891), Trinidad, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the island of Barbados where there is high influence from the Portuguese community. In the early twentieth century the Portuguese government encouraged white emigration to Angola and Mozambique, and by the 1970s, there were up to 1 million Portuguese settlers living in their overseas African provinces. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975, after the Carnation Revolution, while others moved to Brazil and south to South Africa. As of 1989, some 4,000,000 Portuguese were living abroad, mainly in France, Germany, Brazil, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Venezuela, and the United States. Portuguese constitute 13% of the population of Luxembourg. In 2006 there were estimates to be over half a million people of Portuguese origin in the United Kingdom (see Portuguese in the United Kingdom), this is considerably larger than the around 88,000 Portuguese born people alone residing in the country in 2009 (estimation) (however this figure doesn't include British born people of Portuguese descent). In areas such as Thetford and the crown dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey, the Portuguese form the largest ethnic minority groups at 30% of the population, 20% and 3% respectively. The British capital London is home to the largest number of Portuguese people in the UK, with the majority being found in the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Westminster. As a result of interracial marriage and cultural influence, there are Portuguese influenced people with their own culture and Portuguese based dialects in parts of the world other than former Portuguese colonies, most notably in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia (see Kristang people), Barbados, Jamaica (see Portuguese immigration to Jamaica), Aruba, Curaçao, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana (see Portuguese immigrants in Guyana), Equatorial Guinea and Sri Lanka (see Burgher people and Portuguese Burghers). Portuguese ancestry in the Brazilian population. In colonial times, over 700,000 Portuguese settled in Brazil, and most of them went there during the gold rush of the 18th century. They managed to be the only significant European population to populate the country during colonization. The Portuguese migration was strongly marked by the predominance of men (colonial reports from the 16th and 17th centuries almost always report the absence or rarity of Portuguese women). The multiplication of descendants of Portuguese settlers happened to a large degree through miscegenation with black and amerindian women. In fact, in colonial Brazil the Portuguese men competed for the women, because among the African slaves the female component was also a small minority. This explains why the Portuguese men left more descendants in Brazil than the Amerindian or African men did. The Indian and African women were ""dominated"" by the Portuguese men, preventing men of color to find partners with whom they could have children. Added to this, White people had a much better quality of life and therefore a lower mortality rate than the black and indigenous population. Then, even though the Portuguese migration during colonial Brazil was smaller (5 million Indians estimated at the beginning of colonization and 3 to 4 million Africans brought since then, compared to the descendants of the over 700,000 Portuguese immigrants) the ""white"" population (whose ancestry was predominantly Portuguese) was as large as the ""non white"" population in the early 19th century, just before independence from Portugal. After independence from Portugal in 1822, around 1.7 million Portuguese immigrants settled in Brazil. Portuguese immigration into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The immigrants opted mostly for urban centers. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country. However, even among the more recent influx of Portuguese immigrants at the turn of the 20th century, there were 319 men to each 100 women among them. The Portuguese were different from other immigrants in Brazil, like the Germans, or Italians who brought many women along with them (even though the proportion of men was higher in any immigrant community). Despite the small female proportion, Portuguese men married mainly Portuguese women. Female immigrants rarely married Brazilian men. In this context, the Portuguese had a rate of endogamy which was higher than any other European immigrant community, and behind only the Japanese among all immigrants. Even with Portuguese heritage, many Portuguese-Brazilians identify themselves as being simply Brazilians, since Portuguese culture was a dominant cultural influence in the formation of Brazil (like many British Americans in the United States, who will never describe themselves as of British extraction, but only as ""Americans""). In 1872, there were 3.7 million Whites in Brazil (the vast majority of them of Portuguese ancestry), 4.1 million mixed-race people (mostly of Portuguese-African-Native American ancestry) and 1.9 million Blacks. These numbers give the percentage of 80% of people with total or partial Portuguese ancestry in Brazil in the 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a new large wave of immigrants from Portugal arrived. From 1881 to 1991, over 1.5 million Portuguese immigrated to Brazil. In 1906, for example, there were 133,393 Portuguese-born people living in Rio de Janeiro, comprising 16% of the city's population. Rio is, still today, considered the largest ""Portuguese city"" outside of Portugal itself,with 1% Portuguese-born people. Genetic studies also confirm the strong Portuguese genetic influence in Brazilians. According to a study, at least half of the Brazilian population's Y Chromosome comes from Portugal. Black Brazilians have an average of 48% non-African genes, most of them may come from Portuguese ancestors. On the other hand, 33% Amerindian and 28% African contribution to the total mtDNA of white Brazilians was found It was estimated that around five million or more Brazilians can acquire Portuguese citizenship, due to the last Portuguese nationality law that grants citizenship to grandchildren of Portuguese nationals.

It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah in June 2006. History. HubSpot co-founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah met at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2004. Both had backgrounds in the software industry and reportedly planned to launch new companies to create software for small businesses after earning their degrees. Shah invested the first $500,000 in HubSpot followed by Edward B. Roberts, founder and chair of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center. HubSpot’s co-founders were also semi-finalists in an MIT business plan competition for $50,000 in funding. Two years were spent in discussions before HubSpot incorporated in June 2006. A majority of HubSpot’s early customers, investors and employees were MIT classmates, professors, alumni and community members. The company was founded on the idea that traditional marketing was broken and the tools needed to do inbound marketing were too complex and disconnected. HubSpot’s investors include General Catalyst Partners, Matrix Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures and Salesforce.com. It raised $5 million in Series A funding in 2007 and $12 million in Series B funding in 2008 Another $16 million was raised in a C round in 2009, followed by an additional round of funding for $32 million in 2011 brought total funding to $65 million. In the summer of 2010, HubSpot moved its offices into the Davenport, in the Lechmere neighborhood of Cambridge.

Performable developed software for analyzing sales and marketing performance, which had triggers for sending email messages based on a visitors’ prior interaction with the company. On August 18, 2011 the company tweeted its acquisition of Laura Fitton's company oneforty. Oneforty began as an app store for Twitter, but evolved to also be a hub of guides, reviews and other information for marketers to learn how to use social media.

The company focuses its customer acquisition strategy on providing educational material that customers will value. Technology. HubSpot's Content Management System is written in C#, uses the ASP.Net framework, and runs on IIS web servers. The company's server-side code is in Java with Python and NodeJs. Web servers are hosted primarily in Nginx using Django for Python apps. Databases are a combination of MySQL and HBase. HubSpot runs the CentOS operating system on its Amazon EC2 servers with Windows Server for C# app servers. The dashboard uses an API to extract information about links primarily from Moz. HubSpot customers install a piece of JavaScript on their website, which tracks information about every page on the site. This creates data from customers' pages. To address the volume of data and keep queries fast, HubSpot uses a parallel Hadoop analytics cluster and Hive for some queries. HubSpot processes six million tweets per day. HubSpot's hosted products were considered in a private cloud until transitioning to a ""hybrid cloud"". The hybrid cloud keeps certain functions private, while tapping into the resources of a public cloud that can expand quickly as more resources are needed.

He is an angel investor in more than 30 startups and a speaker on inbound marketing, innovation and startups. Shah believes in making fast decisions and allows business owners to grow their business their own way. He supports the mantra of “watch your competitors, but don’t follow them,” meaning that becoming overly absorbed in what the competition is doing can dampen innovation. Dharmesh is an advisor to AngelList. He was named as one of the top innovators by the Boston Globe in May 2011 Dharmesh was quoted that he still writes software code, which he says isn’t work, but more like “a calling.” Corporate culture. HubSpot has documented 13 features of its “post-modern culture.” The company culture was inspired by the AMC television program MadMen. HubSpot created an unlimited vacation day policy on the basis that employees already work through weekends and evenings, so they shouldn’t have to ask for a weekday off. The CEO called the typical corporate vacation policy “a relic of an era when people worked 9 to 5 in an office.” The HubSpot culture has been described as “fun and fast-paced.” Teams are named after Boston sports teams with employees participating in playful viral videos. HubSpot favors cash perks, saying that ping pong tables and foosball tables only collect dust. For example, senior recruits coming from big companies are offered a “jailbreak” bonus of $1,000 per year they spent working for a big corporation. The company has a free beer fridge, which it says encourages employees to spend time together after work and foster camaraderie. HubSpot is aggressive about competing for talent. When HubSpot couldn’t find talent to implement HTML5, it offered a $10,000 bounty to anyone who referred a successful candidate. In 2008 HubSpot salesperson Pete Caputa came up with an idea to increase sales through a partner program, but CEO Brian Halligan didn’t agree with it. Pete spent evenings and weekends working on it until it was so successful, it became his full-time job. Now Pete oversees 30 employees and the partner program accounts for 20 percent of HubSpot’s revenue. This was the start of HubSpot’s startup within a startup program, which supports ideas from employees. HubSpot compares the program to being a venture investor. Most of the programs fail, but come at a low cost. "

wikipedia-1444275," Uwe Boll  Uwe Boll (; born June 22, 1965) is a German director, producer and screenwriter, whose work includes several films adapted from video games. He finances his own films through his Boll KG and Event Film Productions production companies. Many of his films are based on video game franchises, produced on a low budget and some are direct-to-video. He has been described as the ""Ed Wood of the 21st Century"" due to making one critically panned movie after another. Yet, he is notable for getting famous actors such as Oscar winner Ben Kingsley, Ray Liotta, Jason Statham and Dolph Lundgren to star in his movies. Early life. Boll was born in Wermelskirchen. He studied at the University of Cologne and the University of Siegen, and holds a doctorate in literature. He first decided to go into the movie business at ten years old, after seeing Marlon Brando's ""Mutiny on the Bounty"". Films. Boll's first two major releases were the horror movie ""Blackwoods"" and the drama ""Heart of America"", both of which he directed and co-wrote. Boll is best known for adapting video games into movies, having directed and produced a number of such adaptations, including ""House of the Dead"", ""Alone in the Dark"", ""Alone in the Dark II"", ""BloodRayne"", ', ', """", ""Postal"", and ""Far Cry"". In the opening credits to ""Seed"" (2007), Boll used footage of animal abuse and torture he acquired from PETA to underscore the film's nihilism. He has also promised to donate 2.5 percent of his net profits from ""Seed"" to PETA. Financing. Boll's movies have often performed poorly at the box office in the United States. ""House of the Dead"", which was budgeted at $12 million, made $5.73 million in its opening weekend, ""Alone in the Dark"", which was budgeted at $20 million, made $5.1 million, and ""BloodRayne"", which was made for $25 million, made $2.42 million. The least profitable commercial performance of his career was """", which made barely $10 million worldwide at the box office on a $60 million budget. Until the law was changed in 2005, Boll was able to acquire funding for his movies thanks to German tax laws that reward investments in film. The law allowed investors in German-owned films to write off 100% of their investment as a tax deduction; it also allowed them to invest borrowed money and write off any fees associated with the loan. The investor was then only required to pay taxes on the profits made by the movie; if the movie loses money, the investor would get a tax writeoff. In the DVD commentary of ""Alone in the Dark"", Boll explains how he funds his films: ""Maybe you know it but it's not so easy to finance movies in total. And the reason I am able to do these kind of movies is I have a tax shelter fund in Germany, and if you invest in a movie in Germany you get basically fifty percent back from the government."" Boll has received a lot of negative publicity regarding this funding method. Reception and reputation. As of May 2011, ""House of the Dead"" (for which ""VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever"" described Boll as a ""cinematic train wreck"") and ""Alone in the Dark"" appear on the Internet Movie Database's Bottom 100 films list. Three of his films (""Alone in the Dark"", ""House of the Dead"", and ""BloodRayne"") also appeared on GT Countdown's ""Top 10 Worst Video Game Movies""; all were in the top five, with only ""Super Mario Bros."" (at number 2) preventing them all from being in the top three; ""BloodRayne"" was ranked number one. In a review of ""Alone in the Dark"", Rob Vaux states that the movie makes other ""bad"" movie directors feel better in comparison: ""'It's okay,' they'll tell themselves, 'I didn't make ""Alone in the Dark"".'"" Another reviewer wrote that ""Alone in the Dark"" was ""so poorly built, so horribly acted and so sloppily stitched together that it's not even at the straight-to-DVD level."" For example, in one scene a character who was ""killed"" can be seen getting up as the actor prematurely made the move to get off the set. One critic has dubbed him as the ""Jonas Brothers of movie directors"". When rumors surfaced that Boll had expressed interest in a ""Metal Gear Solid"" movie, and claimed to have been given a script to read, ""Metal Gear"" creator Hideo Kojima responded in his audioblog HIDECHAN, ""Absolutely not! I don't know why Uwe Boll is even talking about this kind of thing. We've never talked to him. It's impossible that we'd ever do a movie with him."" Boll later stated that he only thought he was doing the film because he was tricked by someone named Scithe who claimed to work for Konami. Boll also made a bid to direct the upcoming ""World of Warcraft"" movie, but was turned away by the owners of the ""Warcraft"" franchise, ""Blizzard Entertainment"" who said: ""We will not sell the movie rights, not to you…especially not to you."" Boll responded ""Because it’s such a big online game suc­cess, maybe a bad movie would destroy that ongo­ing income, what the com­pany has with it."" Blair Erickson, a writer of a treatment for ""Alone in the Dark"", has written a critical account of his experience working with Boll, in which Erickson alleges that Boll stole ideas from prior movies and wanted to add elements to the story that were not true to the tone of the source material. Uwe chose to not use Erickson's script, citing reasons such as it having ""not enough car chases."" Boll has blamed the poor theatrical performance of his early video game adaptations on his distribution company, Romar, and has filed a lawsuit against them. Boll's films prior to the release of ""House of the Dead"" were more positively received. ""The New York Times"", for instance, gave ""Blackwoods"" a positive review, although most reactions to the film have been negative. On ""X-Play""'s ""Gphoria"" awards show, one of the categories was ""Game Most Deserving of an Uwe Boll Adaptation."" Boll received a rare ""Worst Career Achievement"" award at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards on February 21, 2009 for """", ""1968 Tunnel Rats"", and ""Postal"". Boll has been nominated for Razzies three times in total. Boll has begun to sue BitTorrent users for downloading his film, ""Far Cry"". Response to criticism. Boll does not shy away from his critics. In the ""Alone in the Dark"" DVD commentary, he responds to criticism that his adaptations make significant changes to the plot and style of the source material: ""Fans are always totally flipping out and I understand that the fan of a video game has his own agenda in his head and has his ideas about what is a good movie and what is a bad movie."" Referring to ""House of the Dead"", Boll said: ""I think I made a perfect ""House of the Dead"" movie, because it really shows how the game is. It's a lot of fun, it's over-the-top action."" Boll is especially critical of his Internet detractors. Referring to two Ain't It Cool News critics who negatively reviewed his work, Boll said, ""Harry (Knowles) and Quint (Eric Vespe) are retards."" Boll also criticizes the game companies themselves for providing zero support once the movie license is sold. He cites the cross-promotion and support which comic-book-based properties adapted for the screen receive, whereas video game companies often ""sell off the license and then forget about it."" He argues that this is the reason video game adaptations are not well received by critics and audiences. When ""Wired"" published a negative review of ""Postal"", Boll responded with an e-mail claiming that the critic didn't ""understand anything about movies and that you are an untalented wannabe filmmaker with no balls and no understanding what POSTAL is. You don't see courage because you are nothing. and go to your mom and fuck her ...because she cooks for you now since 30 years ..so she deserves it"" . Boll claims that this angry email was sparked not by the review, but because the ""Wired"" editor told Boll in person that the editor loved the movie then published a negative review. Critic boxing matches (Raging Boll). Boll made headlines by challenging his critics to ""put up or shut up"". In June 2006, his production company issued a press release stating that Boll would challenge his five harshest critics each to a 10-round boxing match. Invitations were also open to film directors Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary. To qualify, critics had to have written two extremely negative reviews of Boll, in print or on the Web. In 2005, footage from the fights were to be included on the DVD of his upcoming film ""Postal"". On June 20, 2006, Rich ""Lowtax"" Kyanka stated on Something Awful that he had been invited by Boll to be the first contestant, after Kyanka reviewed ""Alone in the Dark"". The online gambling site GoldenPalace.com decided to sponsor this event, dubbing it ""Raging Boll"" (a play on the 1980 Martin Scorsese film ""Raging Bull""). A lot was drawn up in late August 2006, featuring Kyanka, ""Rue Morgue"" magazine writer Chris Alexander, webmaster of ""Cinecutre"" Carlos Palencia Jimenez-Arguello, ""Ain't it Cool News"" writer Jeff Sneider and Chance Minter, amateur boxer and website critic. Boll fought and won against all five participants. The first match took place on September 5, 2006, in Estepona, Spain, against Carlos Palencia. The others battled on September 23, 2006, at the Plaza of Nations in Vancouver. After Kyanka lost his match, he would go on to make several allegations against Boll, including the fact that Boll refused to fight against Chance Minter who was an experienced amateur boxer. However, Boll fought Minter as his fourth opponent. He also claimed that Boll misled them by claiming it was a PR stunt when he actually intended to fight them and that Boll claimed that the participants would get training before the match (which no one did). Boll had seriously wounded Sneider, who had also believed Boll. Kyanka added in a post-match interview that, ""Half of us (the contenders) hadn't even seen his movies."" Sneider shared similar sentiments, stating ""I think he's a jerk. This might be PR but I don't want to keep getting punched in the head."" Boll has denied these claims in an interview, stating that he gave his opponents three months to prepare. Other contestants responded less negatively. Alexander, in a ""Toronto Star"" article, recounts being invited to Boll's beach house on the following day, where Boll asked him about the reasons for his universally negative reviews. Alexander bluntly told Boll that his movies were ""bloated, expensive and incoherent attempts at aping American genre pictures, sporting some of the most boneheaded casting choices in filmdom"". He also stated that Boll was an ""insane, two-fisted rogue, and a shockingly honest one at that, someone who absolutely adores film, knows its history and truly lives for what he does."" Alexander referred to the event as ""the weirdest pop culture bizarre journalism stunt I've ever been involved in."" Minter also praised what he had seen of Boll's upcoming production known as ""Seed"". Boll praised the contestants in a post fight press conference, stating ""I now like the critics... Everybody who was in the ring showed guts. Nobody dived."" Electronic Gaming Monthly's November 2006 edition's ""The Rest of the Crap"" section, written by critic Seanbaby, described Seanbaby's own involvement. Apparently Uwe was going to appear on G4's ""Attack of the Show!"" to promote this fight by sparring with one of the hosts. Seanbaby claims that, ""Again, he's a matchmaking genius, because everyone on TV is 3 feet tall. If you were watching Attack of the Show during the time I cohosted, you might have noticed that I could have leaned over and eaten host Kevin Pereira."" A producer of the show then asked if Seanbaby would come and spar in the host's place for the event. Seanbaby says that he trains in Muay Thai and jujutsu, stating that, ""boxing is to fighting what Hungry Hungry Hippos is to fighting."" When Uwe heard of this, he wanted to know Seanbaby's age, height, weight and fighting experience since he ""learned he wasn't fighting a midget."" Seanbaby claims he sent said information to Boll, after which Boll chose not to appear on the program. Canadian comedian Ron Sparks offered to fight Boll in Vancouver as part of the ""Postal"" publicity stunt but Boll declined due to Sparks's age and size advantage. Sparks defended Boll's decision in his MySpace blog, however, saying that because Boll was fighting several boxers back to back, and putting them in his movie, he had the right to choose any opponents willing to fight him. Petition to retire. In April 2008, ""The Guardian"" ran an article claiming Boll had promised to retire if an online petition at PetitionOnline.com asking him to do so received 1,000,000 signatures. On May 7, 2008, the makers of Stride gum announced they would give each signer a digital coupon for a pack of gum if the petition obtained the required 1 million signatures by May 14, 2008. As of July 22, 2012, there are around 353,835 signatures. In an interview with Mike Gencarelli of the ""Movie Mikes"" website on March 22, 2010, Boll stated that he would not retire, should the petition receive one million signatures, commenting: I think no, it has been too long. If they would have made it to a million in like 2 months, then they would have had something. They even got sponsored by that gum factory. I felt like it's three years later, forget it. I also felt that people signed numerous times on the petition so it is probably only like 150,000 people that actually signed it. Response. As part of a publicity stunt for ""Postal"", Uwe Boll released a video stating that he is ""the only genius in the whole fucking business"" and that other directors such as Michael Bay and Eli Roth are ""fucking retards."" He promised that his film ""Postal"" would be ""way better than all that social-critic George Clooney bullshit that you get every fucking weekend."" In response to an ""Anti-Uwe Boll"" online petition, Boll has also expressed hopes that somebody will start a Pro-Uwe Boll petition, which he would expect to hit a million signatures. As of July 22, 2012, the pro-Uwe Boll petition with the most signatures is the ""Long Live Uwe Boll"" poll with a total of 7,631 signatures. Bay responded to the ""fucking retards"" comment by calling Boll ""a sad being"" and stated that he did not care ""in the slightest"" about the remark, while Roth facetiously described Boll's comments as the ""greatest compliment ever."" Boll later noted that the comments were meant to be a generic picture over Hollywood, and that he has nothing against the people mentioned. Boll then appeared on Thursday, April 10's episode of G4's ""Attack of the Show"", where he was interviewed regarding his controversial online retort. In the interview, he said (in regard to Michael Bay and Eli Roth responding to his criticisms) that Roth ""has a sense of humor"" and that Bay ""has no sense of humor."" He also jokingly stated that he believes that his upcoming adaptation of ""Postal"" (from the video game of the same name) could beat ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" at the box office. On April 27, 2008, Boll responded to Bay's ""not caring about Boll"" comment. ""To prove who is the better director"", Boll offered to challenge Bay to a boxing match at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. If Bay accepted, the match would last for 12 rounds and would take place in September. In response to Boll's comments, Bay again posted a statement this time saying: I never even heard his name till last week when he made threats and rants. The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, says he has a doctorate — but uses the word 'retard' in his vocabulary, come on. When you look at his videos, what is interesting are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.  Writings. Boll has written two books, ""Wie man in Deutschland einen Film drehen muss"" (""How one must make a movie in Germany"") and ""Die Gattung Serie und ihre Genres"" (""Genus Series and its Genres""), on themes of serial television.  Upcoming projects. In September 2010, a trailer for his new film, titled ""Auschwitz"", about the concentration camp, was posted on YouTube. The trailer, in which Boll appears as an SS gas-chamber guard, contains explicit scenes of the brutalization and killing of concentration camp inmates. Boll has been quoted as saying that films such as ""Schindler's List"" ""no longer had the ability to reach young people and that it was his duty as a German to make the film as a way of confronting the past."" Boll is the subject of a documentary film titled ""Raging Boll"", directed by Dan Lee West, which premiered at the Austin Film Festival in October 2010. The upcoming Italian zombie film Eaters is presented by Uwe Boll. Boll will also be producing the upcoming film ""Zombie Massacre"" based on the Amiga video game by 1988 Games. In March 2012, it was announced he had created a short horror movie to add to a collective effort. His movie, inspired by Josef Fritzl, focuses on parents with a daughter locked in a room, where they can partake in immoral acts against her. Uwe Boll is also planning a fourth entry in the ""BloodRayne"" franchise in a contemporary setting involving her trying to live a normal life. Natassia Malthe is expected to return, and is expected to be loosely based on the video game ""Bloodrayne 2"". On August 29th, 2013, Boll announced plans to produce a sequel to ""Postal"" based on achieving $500,000 from a Kickstarter campaign. Personal life. He currently lives in Richmond Hill, Ontario, and currently holds both Canadian and German citizenship. His wife is native to Vancouver and he has one child with her. "

wikipedia-34414548," Night of the Owls  ""Night of the Owls"" is a comic book crossover story arc set in the DC Universe. Primarily written by Scott Snyder, the arc is the first major crossover event in the The New 52, and was published across the Batman family of titles in mid-2012. The story pits the Batman and his allies against the Court of Owls organization as they attempt to cement their control over Gotham City, which they have been manipulating in secret for centuries. As described by ""Nightwing"" writer Kyle Higgins, the series is the follow up to """" and divulges more of the history of the city before the turn of the century. The crossover has been described by writer Scott Snyder as the first story arc of a Batman trilogy that he is planning. According to Snyder, in terms of internal chronology, the story arc takes place in a single night within his full ""Batman"" arc ""The Court of Owls."" Plot summary. The story arc stretches across various comic books, each building the story for the ""Night of the Owls"" by following different Gotham characters as they deal with the onslaught of the Court of Owls. Upon hearing a distress call from Alfred, all the members of the ""Bat Family"" race to various targets in an attempt to save them from the Court's assassins, the Talons. In ""Batman"", the Talons descend upon Wayne Manor and infiltrate the Batcave, causing Bruce to defend his home and his base from the intruders before heading into the Court's siege on Gotham. In ""Detective Comics"", Batman quickly makes his way to Arkham Asylum after defending his home to stop the Court from assassinating Jeremiah Arkham. The ""Nightwing"" tie-in issues follow Dick Grayson's encounter with the Talons of the Court, and has more meaning since Dick was being groomed as a child to become a Talon himself while a member of Haley's Circus. In the ""Batman and Robin"" tie-in issue, Robin is tasked with confronting Talons threatening a high-ranking military General targeted for death by the Court. In ""Batgirl"", Barbara is racing to stop one of the Court's Talons from killing her father, Commissioner Gordon, due to his place in the power structure of Gotham that the Court is attempting to dismantle. To conclude the ""Night of the Owls"" crossover, ""Batman Annual"" #1 delved into The New 52 backstory of Mr. Freeze, which now has a tie to the Court. Backstory. The main backstory of the crossover comes from the 1880s during the period of the Wild West. After building the Old Wayne Tower, Alan Wayne removes the thirteenth floor; in its stead, he merges the twelfth and fourteenth floors together due to his superstitions.  Amadeus Arkham and Jonah Hex meet up with each other in Gotham City to investigate crimes committed by the Religion of Crime. Not long after solving the mystery, the duo end up on the case of missing children that eventually have Hex and Arkham arriving in the Batcave. In the Batcave, they are met by the hostile last remnants of the Miagani, the Native American tribe endemic to the Gotham region, but are permitted to leave into Wayne Manor after killing a giant prehistoric bat. Arriving outside Wayne Manor, the two are met by Alan Wayne who decides to help the two track down the leader behind the missing children. Soon after, Hex is met by a female Talon who kills Moody, somebody declared a liability by the Court of Owls. Hex notes the Talon as being an acrobat and reminisces about a wife he had who was an acrobat. The Court of Owls decides to wage war against the Crime Bible and decide to manipulate Hex into fighting their war for them. Alan, and his friends Edward Elliot, Theodore Cobblepot, and Burton Crowne later observe a street performer whose father died during the . The street performer, however, is not a child of Gotham and manages to stop a pickpocket who is doing his dirty business during the performance. The man getting robbed takes the boy in to Haley's Circus. At Haley's, the boy becomes a talented knife-thrower, but eventually returns to Gotham a hero and falls in love with Amelia Crowne. Burton disapproves of the two's relationship, though, and when Amelia is found to be pregnant, William is rebuffed. Feeling outcast, he believed himself to be ""gray""—his allusion to the boundary between the rich and the poor in Gotham society ( ""white"" as rich, ""black"" as poor). When Nathaniel Haley offers him to be a member of the Court, William accepts and within months becomes the greatest Talon to have ever lived. William steals back his son and entrusts him to Nathaniel, asking him to raise the boy as the ""Gray Son of Gotham""; giving the boy the surname, Grayson.  In the early 1920s an insane Alan Wayne believing himself to be chased by the Talon of the 20's ends up in the sewers, where he is attacked and tortured. As he did not put up a great fight, the Talon puts up Alan's picture and disposes of his corpse, which is found later. Around fifty-five years later, Jarvis Pennyworth is writing to his son, Alfred, to tell him not to come to serve the Wayne family. Jarvis is rushing into his car to try and escape Wayne Manor, blaming the downfall of the Waynes on Martha Wayne and himself, but is discovered by a Talon and is killed. Ten years later, a young Bruce Wayne murders a nest of owls in his manor rooftop, believing the Court of Owls to have hired Joe Chill to murder his parents. Alton Carver is put through the final test by the ringmaster of Haley's Circus, to escape a burning fire, which Alton manages to do, though he is badly burned. Sometime after, Alton assumes the role of a Talon. Sometime after Bruce has donned the mantle of Batman, Alton, a Talon who held the mantle longer than the rest, is getting sloppier in his work. Alton is told by the Court that he will be retired, scared, Alton rushes off to see who is to replace him. He discovers that it is Richard Grayson/Nightwing, the heir of William Cobb. Soon after, Alton is put on his final test, but is stopped by Batman, who for the first time, considers the existence of the Court. Court of Owls. Nightwing and Batman investigate an outbreak in Arkham Asylum, leading to Batman investigating about a man who warned Nightwing of the Court of Owls. As Dick Grayson, Nightwing is attacked by Saiko, calling him a murderer without knowing it, though Nightwing manages to escape. Saiko figures out his identity and attacks and kills Mr. Haley, leaving Haley's Circus for Nightwing to inherit. Nightwing then engages in a relationship with Raya, his former childhood friend and member of Haley's Circus. After a meeting with Lincoln March, a candidate for mayor, Bruce is attacked by an assassin named William Cobb. While Bruce manages to survive, Cobb gets away. Bruce notes that Cobb was dressed as the Talon, a legendary figure and a member of the Court of Owls. Nightwing, meanwhile, drives Haley's Circus to Chicago, and then Miami, where he uses Mr. Haley's dying clues to find the Black Book of Names, which has his name and William Cobb's. While investigating into the attack by William Cobb, who is known only as the Talon, Batman finds Cobb's ""nest"" at the Old Wayne Tower, but before he can further investigate, he is attacked by Cobb himself. Cobb manages to defeat the unsuspecting Batman and takes him to three figures, before proceeding to torture him mentally. While Nightwing fights the demon Zohna in New Orleans, his girlfriend Raya meets up with Saiko. Saiko reveals that he knows about the Black book of Names and sleeps with Raya, revealing himself to be none other than Nightwing's childhood friend, Raymond. Nightwing grows confused as to why Saiko has not attacked him and investigates the case, using his skills learned from his tenure as Batman. As Bruce is missing, Nightwing learns of a Flying Grayson's Memorial Show planned in Gotham. Saiko reveals to Raya that he plans on killing Nightwing at the memorial show. At the memorial show, Nightwing confronts Saiko who, to Nightwing's shock, reveals himself as Raymond and blames Nightwing for the torture that he received. Amidst the shock, Saiko triggers explosions around the circus. For eight days, Cobb tortures Batman in a maze that contains portraits of Gotham in the Wild Wild West that also details Gotham's history. As Batman begins to solve the mystery that is presented to him, he realizes the court is trying to undermine him and his presence in Gotham by ""breaking him"". Batman comes to a room of caskets, but does not open them, wishing to solve the rest of the mystery first and attacked and impaled by Cobb. Cobb reveals that as Batman was such a worthy foe, the court will hang his bones in the maze, an honor that only three before him have received. Cobb takes Batman to a room full of members of the Court of Owls who eventually decide on what they shall do with Batman though their youngest member, a girl who wants him hurt even more. Cobb begins to mercilessly beat Batman to the point that he wishes for death, members of the Court then begin to swarm Batman's body. However, refusing defeat, he retaliates and challenges Cobb to another battle, stating that to him, Cobb has no significance and is just another thug. Batman then defeats Cobb in battle and nearly kills him, stopping last moment and using his detective skills to escape the court's lair. Seeing the brutality of the Batman, the Court of Owls decides to awaken all of their Talon's. As Nightwing battles Saiko, a girl named Harper Row helps Batman escape the Court of Owls. Saiko reveals to Nightwing that due to his adoption by Bruce Wayne, Saiko was taken in by the Court of Owls instead of Nightwing. After a battle with Saiko, the villain drops to his death and Nightwing feels responsible. Nightwing returns to the Batcave where Bruce is studying the body of William Cobb, recovered by Alfred. Bruce reveals that due to an agent in the Talon's blood, they can revive themselves, which Cobb cannot do because of a cooling agent Bruce is pumping into Cobb's blood. Bruce then reveals to Nightwing that Cobb is actually Nightwing's great-grandfather and that Nightwing was destined to be a Talon, a goal stopped by his adoption. Night of the Owls. Scouting out the Penguin's base, Selina Kyle and her lover Spark decide to commit espionage against the gang boss. The Court of Owls, angered at Cobb's defeat at the hands of Batman, awaken all of their other Talon's to reclaim Gotham City. They also dispose of Cobb's body for Alfred Pennyworth to find. The Court's goal is to prove that they are the superior legend of Gotham City, not Batman. The owls first attack the Batcave, but the injured Bruce still manages to defeat several of them due to their outdated fighting style. Alfred uncovers the forty targets of the owls and sends a radio message out to the Batman Family for help. Tim Drake and Jason Todd receive one and decide to protect Mr. Freeze. Bruce dons an armored Batman suit to be able to fight all of the owls while one of the owls revives William Cobb. The Birds of Prey are one of the first to fight a Talon who is merciless and cruel in his methods, wanting to kill ""street vermin"". Nightwing receives the message and goes to save Mayor Sebastian Hady. Nightwing has no problem in killing the Talon attacking Hady due to it already being dead, but upon stopping it is knifed in the chest by a revived Cobb, who credits Nightwing, his descendant, working for Batman as his worst betrayal. When Selina and Spark arrive to steal from the Penguin, they see the Penguin's car leaving, but are not aware that the Penguin himself is still alive and being viciously beat down by Ephraim Newman, a Talon. Bruce, meanwhile, continues to fight the Talons invading the Batcave and eventually manages to stop them, and he heads out to save Jeremiah Arkham who is fighting the talons through Roman Sionis, the Black Mask. Nightwing is brutally beat down by Cobb who continues to mock him, Cobb demands that his heir impress him, eventually giving up and calling Nightwing a waste. Nightwing, however, retaliates and electorates Cobb, then offering to take Jeremiah Arkham from Batman. Selina and Spark check the fight out and while Spark wishes to back out, Selina jumps into the fight. After giving Arkham to Nightwing, Batman goes to save Lincoln March. Bruce combats Alton Carver, the Talon sent to kill March, but is unable to stop Carver from killing March, a mayoral candidate who wanted to make Gotham a better place. March gives Batman a package that will make Gotham better and Bruce heads out to burn down the lair of the Court of Owls. Damian heads off to the outskirts of Gotham and decapitates a Talon who was seeking to kill an army general and Batwing proceeds to mutilate a Talon who wanted to assassinate Lucius Fox. Batgirl proceeds to meet a Talon named Mary, who when she sees Batgirl simply strokes her across the face. Batgirl swipes a piece of paper from Mary. Balloon bombs set off by the Court of Owls also begin to go off at random spots. Batgirl then pushes Mary into a balloon bomb, killing her. However, Mary's healing factor keeps her barely alive, and Batgirl keeps her tied up to the Batsignal, which at that point had been sabotaged to display a massive owl. Batgirl then switches the owl with the original bat. The Outlaws capture Mr. Freeze and Red Hood ends up having a ""heart to heart"" with a Talon, who eventually decides that he wants to be control of the second time he is killed, and so begs Red Hood to execute him. The battle against the owls begin to go the way of the Gotham citizens. Alton then awakens, believing himself to finally be free from fear and all that has bound him. Mr. Freeze, however, escapes and tries to kill Bruce Wayne, but once again ends up being stopped twice in one day.  Selina and Spark initially think themselves to have killed the Talon, but later realize that the Talon is in a way immortal. Ephraim takes Selina's whip and begins to mercilessly beat Spark and then choke Selina's lover with it with Selina not understanding. Selina decides to bargain with the Talon, offering him a full set of Talon daggers. Ephraim begins to listen but is shot in the head by the Penguin. Selina and Spark eventually decide not on stealing the Talon daggers that Penguin originally had in his possession and head off to deposit the Talon's body, which they leave at the Batsignal, with the Night of the Owls having come to a close. Fallout. Following the battle, Bruce tracks down the leadership of the grouping of the Court of Owls in Gotham City to the Powers Family. However, when he finds the Court, they are all dead by poison. The next day, confused as to whether or not the Court killed his parents, he deduces the man behind the Court's death. Confronting the now-undead mayoral candidate Lincoln March, he learns that he used Mr. Freeze's Talon serum to survive, and was a member of the Court all along. Lincoln March equips a power armor created for a new generation of Talons to compete with Batman and reveals that he believes himself to be Thomas Wayne Jr.. Knowing fully well the Batman's identity, he accuses Bruce with responsibility for the deaths of Thomas and Martha Wayne. The two very quickly engage in combat, which March dubs ""Owl to Bat"". After a lengthy brawl through the skies of Gotham, March is trapped in an explosion intended to kill Bruce. Later, no body is located. Bruce admits to Dick that although he is skeptical of March's claims and believes his parents would have told him had he had a brother, without March's body and a DNA test he is unable to conclusively prove or disprove March's claims. Titles. The following titles were announced to be part of the crossover. ""Detective Comics"" was originally not part of the crossover, but on February 23, 2012 it was announced that it would be included. Aftermath. As stated by writer Kyle Higgins, Night of the Owls will lead directly into the Nightwing story arc ""Prince of Gotham"", which will feature more development into the character of Dick Grayson. The arc is set to make Dick realize his status as Bruce Wayne's adopted son which will elevate his status as not only a person, but also a superhero. One of the titles introduced in the third wave of The New 52 was ""Talon"" (October 2012, cover dated December 2012), featuring a new character called Calvin Rose, a former Talon himself, on the run from the Court of Owls. "
wikipedia-62417," J. B. S. Haldane  John Burdon Sanderson Haldane FRS (5 November 1892 – 1 December 1964), known as Jack (but who used 'J. B. S.' in his printed works), was a British-born geneticist and evolutionary biologist generally credited with a central role in the development of neo-Darwinian thinking (popularised by Richard Dawkins' 1976 work titled ""The Selfish Gene""). A staunch Marxist, he was critical of Britain's role in the Suez Crisis, and chose to leave Britain, move to India and become an Indian citizen. He was also one of the founders (along with Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright) of population genetics. Biography. Aristocratic family. Haldane was born in Oxford to John Scott Haldane, a physiologist, and Louisa Kathleen Haldane (née Trotter), and descended from an aristocratic intellectual Scottish family (see Haldane family). His younger sister, Naomi, became a writer. His uncle was Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane, politician and one time Secretary of State for War; his aunt was the author Elizabeth Haldane. His father was a scientist, a philosopher and a Liberal, and his mother was a Conservative. Haldane took an interest in his father’s work very early in childhood. It was the result of this lifelong study of the natural world and his devotion to empirical evidence that he became an atheist. He felt that atheism was the only rational deduction available in light of all the evidence, saying, ""My practice as a scientist is atheistic. That is to say, when I set up an experiment I assume no god, angel or devil is going to interfere with its course... I should therefore be intellectually dishonest if I were not also atheistic in the affairs of the world."" Haldane was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford. He obtained first-class honours in mathematical moderations (1912) and Greats (a combination of philosophy and ancient history, 1914). He served in the British Army during the First World War in the Black Watch regiment, being commissioned a second lieutenant on 15 August 1914. Pioneer geneticist. Between 1919 and 1922 he was a Fellow of New College, Oxford, where he researched physiology and genetics. He then moved to the Cambridge University, where he accepted a Readership in Biochemistry at Trinity College and taught until 1932. During his nine years at Cambridge, Haldane worked on enzymes and genetics, particularly the mathematical side of genetics. Haldane wrote many popular essays on science; in 1927 these were collected and published in a volume titled ""Possible Worlds"". He then accepted a position as Professor of Genetics and moved to University College London, where he spent most of his academic career. Four years later he became the first Weldon Professor of Biometry at University College London. In 1923, in a talk given in Cambridge, Haldane, foreseeing the exhaustion of coal for power generation in Britain, proposed a network of hydrogen-generating windmills. This is the first proposal of the hydrogen-based renewable energy economy. Population genetics and the Briggs–Haldane equation. In 1925, G. E. Briggs and Haldane derived a new interpretation of the enzyme kinetics law described by Victor Henri in 1903, different from the 1913 Michaelis–Menten equation. Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten assumed that enzyme (catalyst) and substrate (reactant) are in fast equilibrium with their complex, which then dissociates to yield product and free enzyme. The Briggs–Haldane equation was of the same algebraic form, but their derivation is based on the quasi steady state approximation, that is the concentration of intermediate complex (or complexes) does not change. As a result, the microscopic meaning of the ""Michaelis Constant"" (""Km"") is different. Although commonly referring it as Michaelis–Menten kinetics, most of the current models actually use the Briggs–Haldane derivation. Haldane made many contributions to human genetics and was one of the three major figures to develop the mathematical theory of population genetics. He is usually regarded as the third of these in importance, after R. A. Fisher and Sewall Wright. His greatest contribution was in a series of ten papers on ""A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection"", which was a major series of papers on the mathematical theory of natural selection. It treated many major cases for the first time, showing the direction and rates of changes of gene frequencies. It also pioneered in investigating the interaction of natural selection with mutation and with migration. Haldane's book, ""The Causes of Evolution"" (1932), summarized these results, especially in its extensive appendix. This body of work was a component of what came to be known as the ""modern evolutionary synthesis"", re-establishing natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics. Haldane introduced many quantitative approaches in biology such as in his essay ""On Being the Right Size"". His contributions to theoretical population genetics and statistical human genetics included the first methods using maximum likelihood for estimation of human linkage maps, and pioneering methods for estimating human mutation rates. He was the first to calculate the mutational load caused by recurring mutations at a gene locus, and to introduce the idea of a ""cost of natural selection"". Haldane is also known for an observation from his essay ""On Being the Right Size,"" which Jane Jacobs and others have since referred to as Haldane's principle. This is that sheer size very often defines what bodily equipment an animal must have: ""Insects, being so small, do not have oxygen-carrying bloodstreams. What little oxygen their cells require can be absorbed by simple diffusion of air through their bodies. But being larger means an animal must take on complicated oxygen pumping and distributing systems to reach all the cells."" The conceptual metaphor to animal body complexity has been of use in energy economics and secession ideas. Keen experimenter. Haldane was a keen experimenter, willing to expose himself to danger to obtain data. One experiment involving elevated levels of oxygen saturation triggered a fit which resulted in him suffering crushed vertebrae. In his decompression chamber experiments, he and his volunteers suffered perforated eardrums, but, as Haldane stated in ""What is Life,"" ""the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment."" Awards. In 1952, he received the Darwin Medal from the Royal Society. In 1956, he was awarded the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Among other awards, he received the Feltrinelli Prize, an Honorary Doctorate of Science, an Honorary Fellowship at New College, and the Kimber Award of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Linnean Society of London's prestigious Darwin–Wallace Medal in 1958. Marriage. In 1924, Haldane met Charlotte Burghes (née Franken), a young reporter for the ""Daily Express"". So that they could marry, Charlotte divorced her husband Jack Burghes, causing some controversy. Haldane was almost dismissed from Cambridge for the way he handled his meeting with her, which led to the divorce. They married in 1926. Following their separation in 1942, the Haldanes divorced in 1945. He later married Helen Spurway. Political views. Haldane became a socialist during the First World War, supported the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War, and finally became a Communist. He was an enthusiastic, dialectical materialist Marxist, and wrote many articles in the Communist ""Daily Worker"". He was the chairman of the editorial board of the London edition from 1940 to 1949. His vision of the Socialist principle can be considered pragmatic. In ""On Being the Right Size"", Haldane doubted that socialism could be operated on the scale of the British Empire or the United States or, implicitly, the Soviet Union: ""while nationalization of certain industries is an obvious possibility in the largest of states, I find it no easier to picture a completely socialized British Empire or United States than an elephant turning somersaults or a hippopotamus jumping a hedge."" In 1937, Haldane became a Marxist and an open supporter of the Communist Party, although not a member of the party. In 1938, he proclaimed enthusiastically that ""I think that Marxism is true."" He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1942. The first edition of his children's book ""My Friend Mr. Leakey"" contained an avowal of his Party membership which was removed from later editions. Events in the Soviet Union, such as the rise of anti-Mendelian agronomist Trofim Lysenko and the crimes of Joseph Stalin, may have caused him to break with the Party later in life, although he showed a partial support of Lysenko and Stalin. Pressed to speak out about the rise of Lysenkoism and the persecution of geneticists in the Soviet Union as anti-Darwinist and the denouncement of genetics as incompatible with dialectical materialism, Haldane shifted the focus to the United Kingdom and a criticism of the dependence of scientific research on financial patronage. In 1941, Haldane wrote about the Soviet trial of his friend and fellow geneticist Nikolai Vavilov: The controversy among Soviet geneticists has been largely one between the academic scientist, represented by Vavilov and interested primarily in the collection of facts, and the man who wants results, represented by Lysenko. It has been conducted not with venom, but in a friendly spirit. Lysenko said (in the October discussions of 1939): 'The important thing is not to dispute; let us work in a friendly manner on a plan elaborated scientifically. Let us take up definite problems, receive assignments from the People's Commissariat of Agriculture of the USSR and fulfil them scientifically. Soviet genetics, as a whole, is a successful attempt at synthesis of these two contrasted points of view.' His ambiguous attitude toward the persecution of Vavilov was explicable by the atmosphere of the period, where supporters of Communism needed to be unequivocal. His attitude changed dramatically at the end of the Second World War, when Lysenkoism reached a totalitarian influence in the Communist movement. He then became an explicit critic of the regime. He left the Party in 1950, shortly after considering standing for Parliament as a Communist Party candidate. He continued to admire Stalin, describing him in 1962 as ""a very great man who did a very good job"". India. In 1956, Haldane left his post at University College London, and moved to Calcutta, where he joined the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). Haldane's move to India was influenced by a number of factors. Officially he stated that his chief political reason was in response to the Suez Crisis. He wrote: ""Finally, I am going to India because I consider that recent acts of the British Government have been violations of international law."" His interest in India was also because of his interest in biological research, belief that the warm climate would do him good, and that India offered him freedom and shared socialist dreams. At the ISI, he headed the biometry unit and spent time researching a range of topics and guiding other researchers around him. He was keenly interested in inexpensive research and he wrote to Julian Huxley about his observations on ""Vanellus malabaricus"", the Yellow-wattled Lapwing, boasting that he observed them from the comfort of his backyard. Haldane took an interest in anthropology, human genetics and botany. He advocated the use of ""Vigna sinensis"" (cowpea) as a model for studying plant genetics. He took an interest in the pollination of the common weed ""Lantana camara"". The quantitative study of biology was his main focus and he lamented that Indian universities forced those who took up biology to give up on an education in mathematics. Haldane took an interest in the study of floral symmetry. His wife, Helen Spurway, conducted studies on wild silk moths. In January 1961 they befriended young Canadian lepidopterist Gary Botting, who initially visited the Indian Statistical Institute to share the results of his experiments hybridizing silk moths of the genus Antheraea. Uncomfortable with Haldane's ""communist"" sympathies, the United States cultural attache, Duncan Emery, summarily cancelled Gary Botting's attendance at a high-profile banquet to which the Haldanes had invited him to meet biologists from all over India. Haldane protested this ""insult"" by going on a much-publicized hunger strike. When the director of the I.S.I., P.C. Mahalanobis, confronted Haldane about both the hunger strike and the unbudgeted banquet, Haldane resigned his post (in February 1961) and moved to a newly established biometry unit in Odisha. Haldane eventually became an Indian citizen. He was also interested in Hinduism and after his arrival he became a vegetarian and started wearing Indian clothes. In Kolkata, the busy connecting road from Eastern Metropolitan Bypass to Park Circus area on which the Science City is located, is named after him. In 1961, Haldane described India as ""the closest approximation to the Free World."" His American friend, Jerzy Neyman, a professor of Statistics in the University of California, Berkeley, objected to this premise. Neyman gave his impression that ""India has its fair share of scoundrels and a tremendous amount of poor unthinking and disgustingly subservient individuals who are not attractive."" Haldane retorted: Perhaps one is freer to be a scoundrel in India than elsewhere. So one was in the U.S.A in the days of people like Jay Gould, when (in my opinion) there was more internal freedom in the U.S.A than there is today. The ""disgusting subservience"" of the others has its limits. The people of Calcutta riot, upset trams, and refuse to obey police regulations, in a manner which would have delighted Jefferson. I don't think their activities are very efficient, but that is not the question at issue. When on 25 June 1962, six years after Haldane's move to India, he was described in print as a ""Citizen of the World"" by an American science writer named Groff Conklin, Haldane's response was as follows: No doubt I am in some sense a citizen of the world. But I believe with Thomas Jefferson that one of the chief duties of a citizen is to be a nuisance to the government of his state. As there is no world state, I cannot do this. On the other hand, I can be, and am, a nuisance to the government of India, which has the merit of permitting a good deal of criticism, though it reacts to it rather slowly. I also happen to be proud of being a citizen of India, which is a lot more diverse than Europe, let alone the U.S.A, the U.S.S.R or China, and thus a better model for a possible world organisation. It may of course break up, but it is a wonderful experiment. So, I want to be labeled as a citizen of India. Author and a source of inspiration. Haldane was a famous science populariser. His essay, ""Daedalus; or, Science and the Future"" (1924), was remarkable in predicting many scientific advances but has been criticised for presenting a too idealistic view of scientific progress. Haldane’s book shows the effect of the separation between sexual life and pregnancy as a satisfactory one on human psychology and social life. The book was regarded as shocking science fiction at the time, being the first book about ectogenesis (the development of foetuses in artificial wombs) - ""test tube babies"", brought to life without sexual intercourse or pregnancy. His book, ""A.R.P. (Air Raid Precautions)"" (1938) combined his physiological research into the effects of stress upon the human body with his experience of air raids during the Spanish Civil War to provide a scientific explanation of the air raids that Britain was to endure during the Second World War, then imminent. Haldane was a friend of the author Aldous Huxley, who parodied him in the novel ""Antic Hay"" (1923) as Shearwater, ""the biologist too absorbed in his experiments to notice his friends bedding his wife"". Haldane's discourse in ""Daedalus"" on ectogenesis was an influence on Huxley's ""Brave New World"" (1932) which features a eugenic society. Haldane's work was also admired by Gerald Heard. Haldane was one of those, along with Olaf Stapledon, Charles Kay Ogden, I.A. Richards, and H.G. Wells, whom C.S. Lewis accused of scientism, ""the belief that the supreme moral end is the perpetuation of our own species, and that this is to be pursued even if, in the process of being fitted for survival, our species has to be stripped of all those things for which we value it—of pity, of happiness, and of freedom."" Shortly after the third book of the Ransom Trilogy appeared, J.B.S. Haldane criticised all three of them in an article titled ""Auld Hornie, F.R.S."". The title reflects the sarcastic tone of the article, Auld Hornie being the pet name given to the devil by the Scots and F.R.S. standing for ""Fellow of the Royal Society"".  In the essay, Haldane attacked Lewis for scientific inaccuracies, as well as what Haldane saw as Lewis' ""complete mischaracterization of science, and his disparagement of the human race"". Lewis’s response, ""A Reply to Professor Haldane"", was never published during his lifetime and apparently never seen by Haldane. In it, Lewis claims that he was attacking scientism, not scientists, by challenging the view of some that the supreme goal of our species is to perpetuate itself at any expense. Haldane wrote a popular book for children titled ""My Friend Mr Leakey"" (first published in 1937) which contained the stories ""A Meal With a Magician"", ""A Day in the Life of a Magician"", ""Mr Leakey's Party"", ""Rats"", ""The Snake with the Golden Teeth"", and ""My Magic Collar Stud"". It was reprinted several times – in 1944, 1971, and 1972 with illustrations by Quentin Blake. When he appears as a character in the stories, several of which are written in the first person, he describes his job as a professor, or: ""Doing sums to make new kinds of primroses and cats"". Haldane edited Gary Botting's manuscript on the genetics of giant silk moths with marginal notes. In his preface to ""The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses"", Dr. Botting wrote that when he was a teenager Haldane showed him many species of birds. Botting credited Haldane with throwing him a ""lifeline"" in the form of a demonstrable manifestation of Darwinian evolution, which, decades later, ""rescued"" him from the perils of religious fundamentalism, in particular creationism, that he had faced in his youth. Half a century later, Botting still regarded his visit with J.B.S. Haldane and Helen Spurway as the single most influential existential experience of his life. In his ""An Autobiography in Brief"", written shortly before his death in India, Haldane named four close associates as those showing promise to become illustrious scientists: T. A. Davis, K. R. Dronamraju, S. D. Jayakar and S. K. Roy. Death. Shortly before his death from cancer, Haldane wrote a comic poem while in the hospital, mocking his own incurable disease; it was read by his friends, who appreciated the consistent irreverence with which Haldane had lived his life: ""Cancer’s a Funny Thing: I wish I had the voice of Homer To sing of rectal carcinoma, This kills a lot more chaps, in fact, Than were bumped off when Troy was sacked..."" The poem ends: ""...I know that cancer often kills, But so do cars and sleeping pills; And it can hurt one till one sweats, So can bad teeth and unpaid debts. A spot of laughter, I am sure, Often accelerates one’s cure; So let us patients do our bit To help the surgeons make us fit."" Haldane died on 1 December 1964. He willed that his body be used for study at the Rangaraya Medical College, Kakinada. ""My body has been used for both purposes during my lifetime and after my death, whether I continue to exist or not, I shall have no further use for it, and desire that it shall be used by others. Its refrigeration, if this is possible, should be a first charge on my estate."" External links. There are photographs of Haldane at The biography on the Marxist Writers page has a photograph of Haldane when younger. "
wikipedia-93755," Financial statement  A financial statement (or financial report) is a formal record of the financial activities of a business, person, or other entity. Relevant financial information is presented in a structured manner and in a form easy to understand. They typically include basic financial statements, accompanied by a management discussion and analysis: For large corporations, these statements are often complex and may include an extensive set of notes to the financial statements and management discussion and analysis. The notes typically describe each item on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement in further detail. Notes to financial statements are considered an integral part of the financial statements. Purpose of financial statements by business entities. ""The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance and changes in financial position of an enterprise that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions."" Financial statements should be understandable, relevant, reliable and comparable. Reported assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are directly related to an organization's financial position. Financial statements are intended to be understandable by readers who have ""a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting and who are willing to study the information diligently."" Financial statements may be used by users for different purposes: Government financial statements. The rules for the recording, measurement and presentation of government financial statements may be different from those required for business and even for non-profit organizations. They may use either of two accounting methods: accrual accounting, or cost accounting, or a combination of the two (OCBOA). A complete set of chart of accounts is also used that is substantially different from the chart of a profit-oriented business. Personal financial statements. Personal financial statements may be required from persons applying for a personal loan or financial aid. Typically, a personal financial statement consists of a single form for reporting personally held assets and liabilities (debts), or personal sources of income and expenses, or both. The form to be filled out is determined by the organization supplying the loan or aid. Audit and legal implications. Although laws differ from country to country, an audit of the financial statements of a public company is usually required for investment, financing, and tax purposes. These are usually performed by independent accountants or auditing firms. Results of the audit are summarized in an audit report that either provide an unqualified opinion on the financial statements or qualifications as to its fairness and accuracy. The audit opinion on the financial statements is usually included in the annual report. There has been much legal debate over who an auditor is liable to. Since audit reports tend to be addressed to the current shareholders, it is commonly thought that they owe a legal duty of care to them. But this may not be the case as determined by common law precedent. In Canada, auditors are liable only to investors using a prospectus to buy shares in the primary market. In the United Kingdom, they have been held liable to potential investors when the auditor was aware of the potential investor and how they would use the information in the financial statements. Nowadays auditors tend to include in their report liability restricting language, discouraging anyone other than the addressees of their report from relying on it. Liability is an important issue: in the UK, for example, auditors have unlimited liability. In the United States, especially in the post-Enron era there has been substantial concern about the accuracy of financial statements. Corporate officers (the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO)) are personally responsible for fair financial reporting allowing those reading the report to have a good sense of the organization. Standards and regulations. Different countries have developed their own accounting principles over time, making international comparisons of companies difficult. To ensure uniformity and comparability between financial statements prepared by different companies, a set of guidelines and rules are used. Commonly referred to as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these set of guidelines provide the basis in the preparation of financial statements, although many companies voluntarily disclose information beyond the scope of such requirements. Recently there has been a push towards standardizing accounting rules made by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB""). IASB develops International Financial Reporting Standards that have been adopted by Australia, Canada and the European Union (for publicly quoted companies only), are under consideration in South Africa and other countries. The United States Financial Accounting Standards Board has made a commitment to converge the U.S. GAAP and IFRS over time. Inclusion in annual reports. To entice new investors, public companies assemble their financial statements on fine paper with pleasing graphics and photos in an annual report to shareholders, attempting to capture the excitement and culture of the organization in a ""marketing brochure"" of sorts. Usually the company's chief executive will write a letter to shareholders, describing management's performance and the company's financial highlights. In the United States, prior to the advent of the internet, the annual report was considered the most effective way for corporations to communicate with individual shareholders. Blue chip companies went to great expense to produce and mail out attractive annual reports to every shareholder. The annual report was often prepared in the style of a coffee table book. Moving to electronic financial statements. Financial statements have been created on paper for hundreds of years. The growth of the Web has seen more and more financial statements created in an electronic form which is exchangeable over the Web. Common forms of electronic financial statements are PDF and HTML. These types of electronic financial statements have their drawbacks in that it still takes a human to read the information in order to reuse the information contained in a financial statement. More recently a market driven global standard, XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), which can be used for creating financial statements in a structured and computer readable format, has become more popular as a format for creating financial statements. Many regulators around the world such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have mandated XBRL for the submission of financial information. The UN/CEFACT created, with respect to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (GAAP), internal or external financial reporting XML messages to be used between enterprises and their partners, such as private interested parties (e.g. bank) and public collecting bodies (e.g. taxation authorities). Many regulators use such messages to collect financial and economic information. "
wikipedia-20985697," MeetMe  MeetMe (formerly MyYearbook) is a social networking service founded in 2005 and provides the opportunity to interact and meet new people. History. ""MeetMe"" was initially created as ""myYearbook"" by two high school students, Dave and Catherine Cook, and their older brother Geoff, during Spring Break of 2005. Catherine persuaded Geoff, who founded EssayEdge.com and ResumeEdge.com from a dorm in 1997, to invest in their project. At the launch of the site, Dave was a junior and Catherine was a sophomore; the project was initially activated at Montgomery High School, in suburban New Jersey where they attended. The site was created entirely by developers in India. In 2008, ""myYearbook"" partnered with casual game developer ""Arkadium"" to bring Flash based games to the site. The games incorporate Lunch Money, the myYearbook virtual currency. Lunch Money earned playing games are used elsewhere on the site. In April 2009, the site added the Meebo instant messaging client to the site in order to provide real time chat. In November 2009, ""myYearbook"" launched Chatter, a real-time stream that incorporates media sharing and gaming to help bring members together. Games you can play inside the stream include Ask Me, Rate Me and 2 Truths and a Lie. These games incorporate mechanics that help myYearbook members meet each other. By April 2010 the site reported the Chatter feature surpassed 1 million posts per day. In January 2010, ""myYearbook"" rolled out a new site design aimed to appeal to an older demographic.

wikipedia-15489126," Nesting instinct  Nesting instinct refers to an instinct or urge in pregnant animals to prepare a home for the upcoming newborn(s). It is found in a variety of animals (both mammals and birds) including humans. In animals. In rodents and lagomorphs, the nesting instinct is typically characterized by the urge to seek the lowest sheltered spot available; this is where these mammals give birth. Female dogs may show signs of nesting behavior shortly before their due date that include pacing and building a nest with items from around the house such as blankets, clothing, and stuffed animals. (They also sometimes do this in cases of false pregnancy, or pseudocyesis). Domestic cats often make nests by bringing straw, cloth scraps, and other soft materials to a selected nook or box; they particularly are attracted to haylofts as nest sites. In birds it is known as ""going broody"", and is characterized by the insistence to stay on the nest as much as possible, and by cessation of laying new eggs. Marsupials do not exhibit a nesting instinct per se, because the mother's pouch fulfills the function of housing the newborns. Hormones and nesting behavior. Maternal nest-building is regulated by the hormonal actions of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin. Given the importance of shelter to offspring survival and reproductive success, it is no wonder that a set of common hormonal signals has evolved. However, the exact timing and features of nest building vary among species, depending on endocrine and external factors. In rabbits, nest building occurs towards the last third of pregnancy. The mother digs and builds a nest of straw and grass, which she lines with hair plucked from her body. This sequential motor pattern is produced by changes in estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin levels. Six to eight days pre-partum, high levels of estradiol and progesterone lead to a peak in digging behavior. Both estradiol and progesterone are produced and released by the ovaries. One to three days pre-partum, straw-carrying behavior is expressed as a function of decreasing progesterone levels, maintenance of high estradiol levels, and increasing prolactin levels. This release of prolactin (from the anterior pituitary) is likely caused by the increase in estrogen-to-progesterone ratio. One day pre-partum to four days post-partum, hair loosening and plucking occur as a result of low progesterone and high prolactin levels, together with a decrease in testosterone. In house mice and golden hamsters, nest-building takes place earlier, at the start or middle of pregnancy. For these species, nest-building coincides with high levels of estrogen and progestin. External factors also interact with hormones to influence maternal nest-building behavior. Pregnant rabbits that have been shaved will line their straw nest with available alternatives, such as male rabbit hair or synthetic hair. If given both straw and hair, mothers prefer straw during the straw-carrying period, and prefer hair during the nest-lining period. If given hair as the only material, shaved mothers collect the hair even when it is the straw-carrying period. Interestingly, research on avian paternal behavior shows that nest-building is triggered by different stimuli in the two sexes. Unlike the case for females, male nest-building among ring doves depends on the behavior of the prospective mate rather than on hormonal mechanisms. Males that are castrated and injected daily with testosterone either court females or build nests, depending purely on the behavior of the female. Hence, the male avian transition from courtship to nest-building is prompted by social cues and not by changes in hormone levels. In humans. In human females, the nesting instinct often occurs around the fifth month of pregnancy, but can occur as late as the eighth, or not at all. It may be strongest just before the onset of labor. It is commonly characterized by a strong urge to clean and organize one's home and is one reason why couples who are expecting a baby often reorganize, arrange, and clean the house and surroundings.

One of their more successful vacations uncovered a supply of high test aviation gas hidden by German agents in Baja California. After their divorce in 1947, she married a third time the following year to ""Los Angeles Times"" sportswriter, Dick Irving Hyland. The marriage lasted two years before the couple divorced. Her final marriage was to Robert Mindell, a hotel executive. The two remained together for eight years before they divorced in 1971. She was actually born in 1916, but the studio reportedly made her two years older for her to play a wider variety of roles, including romantic roles. In ""That's My Boy,"" she was cast as the mother of Gil Stratton, who was only six years her junior. In 1972, Hudson was found dead in her home at the Palm Desert Country Club. A business associate with whom she had been working in real estate discovered her body sprawled on the bathroom floor. Hudson died of a heart attack brought on by a liver ailment. Her only close survivor was her mother. "

wikipedia-5079733," Race the Sun  Race the Sun is a 1996 comedy-drama movie starring Halle Berry and James Belushi. The plot is loosely based on the true story of the Konawaena High School Solar Car Team, which finished 18th in the 1990 World Solar Challenge and first place among high school entries. Plot. A new science teacher (Halle Berry) at Kona Pali High School in Hawaii pushes a group of students to come up with a science project. With a combination of design vision, mechanical skills, knowledge of batteries, and lightweight drivers, the students design and build a solar-powered car they name ""Cockroach."" Their team manages to outperform a corporate-sponsored car and win the local Big Island competition by correctly predicting cloudy weather based on the surfing experience of the student captain, Daniel (Casey Affleck). Cloudy weather would make their vehicle's battery capacity a more important factor than its weight. With the shop teacher as chaperone (James Belushi), the students travel to Australia to compete in the World Solar Challenge. To the relief of their corporate sponsor (Kevin Tighe), who is still bitter over the loss of his company-built vehicle in Hawaii, their car is delayed at the very start of the race. However, the students choose to persevere and remain in the race.  A sand storm and other difficulties provide occasions for heroism. Uni Kakamura (Sara Tanaka) pilots the car through difficult terrain, but has an accident and is rescued by Gilbert (J. Moki Cho). After Cindy (Eliza Dushku) is disqualified from driving for drinking alcohol, Eduardo (Anthony Ruivivar) puts aside his ""lolo-haole"" conflict with Daniel and reduces the car to allow the overweight Gilbert to drive. Production. The film was written and co-produced by Barry Morrow, who had shared the 1988 Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay for ""Rain Man"". The story was based on the solar car team from Konawaena High School, which finished 18th overall in the 1990 World Solar Challenge and first place among high school entries, and was the first high school team to finish the Challenge. Reception. Stephen Holden of the ""New York Times"" said the ""movie doesn't waste time admiring the technology at the expense of human drama, of which there is plenty, none of it overblown"". Peter Stack of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" compared ""Race the Sun"" to ""Cool Runnings"" for solar cars, saying it ""boasts not only the lively spectacle of the race but also the kids learning to set aside their differences and insecurities to bond as a team. It's not a soaring, transcendent film experience -- mostly it's corny and predictable. But it has a certain sunny charm and a few winning gags to keep it in the winning column."" Carole Glines of ""Box Office"" Magazine also mentions the film's predictability, saying the student characters ""all receive about a minute of screen time for character development as the plot paces through its predictable course."" Hollis Chacona of the ""Austin Chronicle"" said ""you might as well call this movie ""Hot Runnings"""", and notes that J. Moki Cho's character Gilbert gives this film substance and a ""sweet quality that makes it easier to swallow than you might expect"". The film grossed $1.1 million on its opening weekend and grossed a total of $1.9 million in the U.S. "
wikipedia-595549," The Critic  The Critic is an American prime time animated series revolving around the life of New York film critic Jay Sherman, voiced by actor Jon Lovitz. It was created by writing partners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had previously worked as writers and showrunners (seasons 3 and 4) on ""The Simpsons"". ""The Critic"" had 23 episodes produced, first broadcast on ABC in 1994, and finishing its original run on Fox in 1995. Episodes featured movie parodies with notable examples including a musical version of Apocalypse Now, ""Howard Stern's End"" (""Howards End""), ""Honey, I Ate the Kids"" (""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids/The Silence of the Lambs""), ""The Cockroach King"" (""The Lion King""), ""Abe Lincoln: Pet Detective"" (""""), ""Scent of a Jackass"" and ""Scent of a Wolfman"" (""Scent of a Woman""). The show often referenced popular movies such as ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" and ""The Godfather"", and routinely lampooned actor Marlon Brando and actor/director Orson Welles. They also spoofed Dudley Moore, usually as his character Arthur Bach from the 1981 film ""Arthur"". Despite the ratings improving, ""The Critic"" was cancelled after only two seasons. It continued to air through reruns on Comedy Central and then on Locomotion. From 2000 to 2001, ten web episodes were later produced using Adobe Shockwave, and were broadcast on AtomFilms.com and Shockwave.com. In 2004, the DVD box set was released, which includes all 23 TV episodes and the web episodes. In the late 2000s, reruns of the show aired again on ReelzChannel in the US and on Teletoon's programming block Teletoon at Night in Canada. Production. The show was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who along with James L. Brooks served as executive producers. The Critic was produced by Colombia Pictures in association with Gracie Films. The show's animation was done by Film Roman. It was co-produced by Patric Verrone. The show sometimes included appearances of real life critics, such as Gene Shallit and Siskel and Ebert, who provided their own voices. When choosing things to parody, Reiss and Jean made a conscious decision to find the right balance between current pop culture, and references that would stand the test of time. The Critic was ""the first major non-family sitcom animated program to appear in primetime"". The show started out on ABC in 26 January 1994, where it aired 13 episodes. It was cancelled by the network after half a season, and was then moved onto Fox the following year where it ran for another 10 episode season. Around this time, it was included in a ""shameless plug"" crossover with The Simpsons and assumed the timeslot immediately after the show in the TV schedule, in an attempt to popularise it. But despite improvement of the ratings, Fox moved it to a different timeslot after 5 episodes, and also cancelled it after this run had finished airing in May 1995. According to The TV IV, nine scripts were already written for the planned third season and the show was going to be moved to UPN, but an agreement was not reached, and also Fox refused to officially cancel the show until much later. The show was not renewed on any network, and effectively became cancelled. The show returned in Flash-animated webisode form in 2000-2001, for a third series with 10 3-5 minute installments. Design. Four people have a design credit on the show: David Silverman, Rich Moore, David Butler, and Everett Peck. Silverman designed the look of Jay Sherman. Moore and Butler designed the general look of the show including some of the backgrounds and supporting cast. The character of Doris was based on Peck's drawings. Butler helped in the hard task of standardising all these animation styles. Moore was the supervising director, so oversaw a lot of the design process - and was also responsible for how the action would play out, and how each shot would be framed. Rich Moore explains ""the design of Jay Sherman began as a sketch done by David Silverman"" on a napkin/place-mat in a restaurant. He was designed as ""Kaufmanesque"", and Jim Brooks liked the design, so his design remained much the same for the pilot episode. Moore had his reservations as the character had a ""flat head and tiny eyes that were hard to act with"", and was composed of shapes that were difficult to turn in a 3D space. It was decided the drawing encapsulated the humanity and reality of the critic, so was left unchanged. Over the course of the two seasons however, the design was altered slightly. The flat head was made more round, and his eyes became bigger - in order to make Sherman more appealing and more easily animatable. The design team never intended to make the characters too cartoony as it would not have fit tonally with the type of show. The characters were designed via a general thinktank process of ""what do we like about the characters and what are we trying to say about them?"". Quick sketches were completed in front of the full creative team after a discussion about characters, which were then critically analysed. In particular, the design of the parents caused some issues. Jim Brooks described the father as a ""crazy wasp"". The designs were eventually based on a photo of a professor and his wife. Moore explains that the animation should never ""step on the voices or the writing"". Casting. Jean and Reiss had a lot of trouble casting the voice for Margo, Jay's sister. Nancy Cartwright (who plays Bart in The Simpsons) was eventually given the role. She used a voice very similar to her natural one. Christine Cavanaugh - who had done voice acting with roles like Babe and Chuckie Finster - was cast as Marty. The Ted Turner-esque boss was played by Charles Napier, using his real voice. Due to the sheer number of film and TV parodies, the team also sought character actors who could play many different roles. During the audition process, they asked them to perform their acts, which Reiss described as ""very entertaining"". Maurice LaMarche impressed Jean by doing ""perfect"" impressions. LaMarche even beat out genuine Australians for the role of Australian actor Jeremy Hawke. He was often asked to work on his accent of a pop culture figure related to media just released or that would have been released by the time of the episode's airing. Depending on who could do the voice better, the characters were divided up between Nick Jameson and Maurice. Each would play about 20-30 characters per show. According to Maurice LaMarche, he played twenty seven characters one episode. Maurice specialised in impressions, while Nick's specialty was accents and dialects. History. The series was created by writing partners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had previously worked as showrunners for The Simpsons. The two had a contract with executive producer James L. Brooks to create an original series that he would help sell to a network and, at the time, Brooks had a deal with ABC that essentially meant that they would put anything he brought them on the air for 22 episodes. The initial idea came from Brooks, who approached Jean and Reiss with an idea about doing a show based around the backstage of a morning show like Today or Good Morning America from the perspective of a make-up artist at the show. They described it as like ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" except during the daytime. However, neither of the two writers knew anything about make-up and felt unqualified to write the series. Over time, the pitch was reshaped until ""A League of Their Own"" was released, which co-starred Jon Lovitz. The duo decided to write a role specifically for Lovitz, who they had worked with in the past when he did voices for The Simpsons, and wrote him as a film critic. They dropped the earlier ideas entirely and let the series develop from there. When the series was first coming together, it was meant to be a live-action sitcom. Lovitz was enthusiastic about doing the show, but was unable to commit to a live-action shooting schedule because of his commitments for A League of Their Own. Because they were already familiar with animation and to make sure Lovitz could do the show, they decided to turn the series into a cartoon. They eventually figured out that even if they had done the series in live-action, it would have cost millions of dollars per episode because of the elaborate movie parodies that frequently appear in the cartoon. The ABC Season. Reiss and Jean sold the series to ABC based on the pilot script, despite a completely lack of any visuals nailed down. ABC gave them a 13 episode commitment, which allowed them to move on to designing the aesthetic of the series. The one stipulation Lovitz had was that he didn't want Sherman to look like him, although the two more or less look alike in the end. They also make a conscious decision to make it as far from The Simpsons as possible, despite hiring Simpsons alumni in key art positions. The series premiered on January 26, 1994 on ABC, leading into ""Home Improvement"", and began airing at an extremely inopportune time. The popularity of The Simpsons had led to major networks trying their hands, and largely failing, at primetime animation. By the time The Critic started airing, shows like Family Dog and Fish Police had already failed to gain an audience. The first episode also managed to garner massive amounts of hate mail, which likely discouraged the network further. In the season's most crucial ratings week, ""A Little Deb Will Do Ya"" aired against the Women's Figure Skating final during the 1994 Winter Olympics, which was seen by over 46 million households (a 48.5 share) and rates as one of the highest rated broadcasts on American television. The crew was informed that they would not be renewed midway through the first season. They creators scrambled to retest episodes and put together a new pitch for other networks, eventually settling with Fox. The Fox Season. Fox picked up the series for a 10 episode second season after it was dropped by ABC. The series creators paid particular attention to focus groups and other sources of criticism. They changed some of the designs, opting to make Jay Sherman's head rounder and his pupils bigger, introduced a love interest (Alice Tompkins) and generally made Sherman's character less pathetic. The lower budget also necessitated a clip show episode as one of the 10 from the season. The series went over as poorly at Fox as it did at ABC. In the DVD commentary tracks, Al Jean offered several reasons why the show failed on Fox despite promising ratings when put alongside The Simpsons (particularly after the cameo appearances by Jay Sherman on The Simpsons), mainly that the network simply didn't have as much financial interest in the series because they didn't own it. The Critic was solely owned by Sony, which meant that reruns and syndication deals would not net Fox any money down the road, whereas a 20th Century Fox show like ""King of the Hill"" would yield profits. He also suggested that Fox had less invested into the series because it was inherited from another network. The series was canceled a second time after the second season. After Fox. Once it became clear that the series would not have a long life on Fox, the producers started talks to move the series yet again. Nine scripts for the never produced third season were written, including a parody of ""Single White Female"", and UPN was interested in picking the show up. However, the budget would have been slashed dramatically and Fox wouldn't officially cancel the series, for fear of them jumping to another network and succeeding. Negotiations broke down and the series was finally put down for good on broadcast television. In 2000, the series was resurrected briefly on AtomFilms.com as a series of webisodes animated using Adobe Shockwave. The art was significantly more rudimentary and nearly every character was dropped with the exception of Jay Sherman and a single appearance by Vlada. The webisode series largely was an excuse to do more movie parodies, but also featured a narrative of Jay trying to date his new young make-up lady, Jennifer. Each webisode was between 3 and 5 minutes long, the series ran for 10 episodes. The series was popularized again when Comedy Central bought the broadcasting rights and aired it alongside other acquired animated comedies like ""Duckman"" and Undergrads. The series, for a time, was one of the most watched shows on Comedy Central. A DVD collecting both seasons and the webisodes was released in 2004. AOL TV published an article in 2009 entitled ""Gone Too Soon: The Critic"", in which they analysed the cancellation of the show. It said ""The creators and Lovitz seem to about the show, as there are always talks cropping up of a revival of The Critic, either as an animated project, or possibly a live-action one. There are fan sites out there, but as time passes with no new material, many of these are becoming floating time capsules"". Plus, a lot of effort was put into the release of the DVD (which there was a lot of demand for), meaning there is still a fan base as well as a passionate cast and crew. Gone too soon. ""Drawn to Television"" says that like Jay's show-within-a-show Coming Attractions, ""audiences never quite warmed up to Sherman and his surrounding cast of characters"" in The Critic, perhaps due to the lack of warmth between character interactions in both shows. The Magic Behind the Voices put its cancellation down to ""so-so ratings and network politics"". Planet Simpsons says it ""failed to click with Simpsons fans"". In 1994, Austin American-Statesman said ""The Critic never had a prayer on ABC, where the comedy overload consists of domestic sitcoms"". The show is generally considered one of the great TV shows cancelled too early into its run. Columbia Spectator said the show was ""one of television's great lost causes."" Voice actor Maurice LaMarche considered ""The Critic"" one of his ""personal favorites"", saying ""I would almost give anything to bring back The Critic, along with ""Pinky and the Brain""; those are the two most satisfying jobs I've ever had"". OGeeku said ""This show did not last as long as it should have and that is truly a shame. The Critic was in its time, one of the greatest animated shows ever made and one of the funniest shows period on television"". Reiss thinks the show holds up very well. Early on in its run, Siskel and Ebert did a review of the show. It was the only television series they ever reviewed. Some of the criticisms they provided, if left unattended to, may have been factors to the show's cancellation. They said the show doesn't have as many memorable characters as The Simpsons, and encouraged the writers to work on that. They said the second episode was a let down because ""it didn't seem to be about the world of a movie critic"", and was instead about ""a single dad and his geeky son"". They said the jokes involving Jay's dad get tiresome, and that the station boss isn't as sharp a parody as he could be. Siskel said, ""if The Critic is gonna succeed - and I hope it does - it desperately needs to refocus itself on the movies and the way critics interact with them"". He added that the show needs a second critic, and jokingly said he and Ebert should (and would love to) save the show by writing scripts for them. Ebert said the show should have 2-3 movie/genre parodies per episode. He added he would like to see Jay watch television to allow the show to satirize that medium as well. This would focus the show on the media, and not let it become another show about a man and his problems. Siskel said the writers should keep Jay as a smart critic. Regardless of his personality, if his critiques are witty and intelligent, by extension the show's satire becomes much sharper. Plot. The show follows the life of 36-year-old film critic from New York named Jay Prescott Sherman. His televised review show is called ""Coming Attractions"", which airs on the Philips Broadcasting cable network. He is also ""cold, mean-spirited, and elitist"". His signature line, upon experiencing bad art, is ""It stinks!"". Each episode was crammed full of film references and parodies. Some of the secondary characters that are a part of Jay's story include his nutty adoptive father, his well-meaning son Marty, the Australian movie star Jeremy Hawke, Margo - the biological child of his adoptive parents, his snide make-up lady Doris, and his boss Duke Phillips. In the second season, Jay acquired a love interest - a Southern woman named Alice Tompkins, who later became his long-term girlfriend. Relationship with ""The Simpsons"". The AV Club explains ""in creating The Critic, Al Jean and Mike Reiss set out to make the show as dissimilar from the The Simpsons as humanly possible"". Nevertheless, there are many similarities between the two series. ""Gen X TV: The Brady Bunch to Melrose Place"" argues that The Critic became a critical success while other animated shows of the early 1990s flopped was because ""the makers of these shows failed to realize that The Simpsons didn't become a hit because of animation because of its style of humor"", and says that The Critic understood this. It adds the show ""took the media-obsession/parody portions of The Simpsons and created separate show around them. Planet Simpsons describes the show as ""the closest thing The Simpsons ever had to a spin-off"". The Critic also shares The Simpsons' love for criticizing Fox and the audience, such as Jay's frequent line ""You're watching Fox, shame on you"" and ""The Critic will be right back, you TV addicted couch monkeys"" before the show went to commercial break. The AV Club says ""The Critic made its protagonist the anti-Homer Simpson. Where Homer is a booze-sodden everyman, Jay Sherman is an unabashed elitist. Where Homer is a rudely physical creature, Jay leads a life of the mind. Homer is a slob. Jay is a snob"". While ""Springfield is very aggressively and deliberately Anywhere, United States, The Critic is an extended Valentine to a certain kind of pointy-headed East Coast elitism"". Matt Groening had no part in its inception, and wanted to make this very clear, so he would not be associated with any success or failure the show would have. He claimed that in the public consciousness, this was his show - a direct spin-off to The Simpsons. He decided to take his name off the credits of the crossover episode, and publicly complained about the episode, which went to air in the end. He said ""for more than six months i tried to convince Jim Brooks and everyone connected with the show not to do such a cynical thing, which would surely be perceived by the fans as nothing more than a pathetic attempt to...advertise The Critic at the expense of the integrity of The Simpsons"". In response, Brooks said "" is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate. But his behavior right now is rotten. And its not pretty when a rich man acts like this"". Many voice actors appear in both The Simpsons and The Critic, and regulars on both shows have made cameos in the others. For example, Nancy Cartwright, Doris Grau, and John Lovitz have all played primary/secondary characters on both shows. Maurice LaMarche, who played many characters on The Critic, ""played George C. Scott getting hit in the groin with a football"" in the crossover episode. His only line was ""Oh, my groin"". He also did Jay's belch in the episode. Crossovers. In Dukarella, Jay and Alice attend a costume ball dressed as Homer and Marge. Homer and Bart Simpson made a brief appearance in ""Dial M for Mother"". During an interview with Geraldo Rivera, Jay is asked about talking over the heads of his audience and does just that in his answer. An annoyed family watching changes the channel to ""The Simpsons"", where Homer—after stepping on a rake—exclaims, ""D'oh!"" and Bart replies, ""Ay caramba!"" The family's father comments, ""Now, this I understand."" This is a satirical suggestion that The Simpsons is low-brow. Jay had a guest appearance in an episode of ""The Simpsons"" titled ""A Star Is Burns"", presiding over a local film festival. This episode caused some conflict between ""Simpsons"" creator Matt Groening and executive producer James L. Brooks. Groening, believing the episode was little more than a thirty-minute advertisement for one of Brooks's less successful projects, had his credit removed from the episode and did not appear on its DVD commentary. When Jay enters the Simpson household, Bart is watching a ""Flintstones""-""Jetsons"" crossover show, which he criticizes; he then praises Jay and ""Coming Attractions""/""The Critic"", before shuddering and saying to himself ""I feel so ""dirty""."" At the end of the episode, as he is leaving for New York, Jay offers the Simpsons to appear on ""Coming Attractions""/""The Critic"", but Bart declines, saying, ""Nah, we're not going to be doing that."" Jay has yellow skin when he appears on ""The Simpsons"" but pink skin on ""The Critic"". Jay appeared briefly on ""The Simpsons"" a few more times. In the episode ""Hurricane Neddy,"" he was in an insane asylum apparently unable to say anything more than his catchphrase (Doctor: ""Yes, Mr. Sherman. ""Everything"" stinks."") In the episode ""The Ziff Who Came to Dinner"", he is seen at Moe's Tavern with all the other characters on the show that Lovitz voices or has voiced. Hallmarks. Much like the opening sequence in ""The Simpsons"" with its chalkboard, sax solo, and couch gags, ""The Critic"" has a distinctive opening sequence featuring minor gags. Jay answered a different phone call and was later shown reviewing a different movie parody clip in each episode—always followed by the negative assessment, ""It ""stinks""!"" by Jay Sherman. There was also a cinema gag at the end of each episode. Themes. The main source of satire in The Critic is of the entertainment industry. The AV Club explains ""Mike Reiss and Al Jean-written episodes of The Simpsons are often defined by a high number of parodies, spoofs and homages. In their episodes, the Simpsons are always watching television or going to the movies. They didn’t need any such excuse for film parodies on The Critic since Jay’s life was inherently and organically filled with film. It proved the perfect delivery system for an endless series of clever, bite-sized spoofs."" The book ""I'm an English Major--Now What?"" epitomises this by recounting a scene where Jay is forced to rate movies ""on a scale of good to excellent"" - thereby negating his credibility as a film critic. Sherman says ""but what if I won't like something"", to which his boss Duke replies, ""That's what good is for"". This shows the corruption of an industry that aims to provide unbiased thoughtful analyses of films, due to bribery and politics. Another example is in the June 22 episode ""L.A. Jay"", where after trying to break into the movie business by writing a script, which is revealed to be rather good, a studio buys it off him for $100,000 in order to bury it, thereby keeping quality out of the industry. While episodes typically dealt with his private life, Jay's position as a film critic ""offer numerous opportunities for the show to satirise the film industry, establishing a duologue with popular culture"" in a very similar way to what The Simpsons had already been doing for years. The Critic also frequently made fun of celebrities, sometimes in mean-spirited ways. ""Drawn to Television"" cites the fat jokes directed at Marlon Brando or Orson Wells. The Critic also frequently comments on television. For example, one episode criticises a character's project to colourise a series of classic black-and-white films for broadcast on a cable channel. The process involves making the films ""more attractive to a contemporary audience"" by ""inserting computer-generated happy endings"". The article ""Ten Frighteningly Prophetic Parodies from ‘The Critic’"" explores the show's spoofs that ""have come true (or close to true), proving that there really isn’t anything that’s too stupid for Hollywood to make"" - an almost meta-satirical statement in that things that the writer thought were too ridiculous to be true at the time, ended up coming to fruition. GrabBagCinema said, ""What was great about this show, was that it always knew how to make you laugh and poke fun at celebrities, and their movies. It was so well written because it really understood movies, celebrities, Hollywood and humour. If you weren’t a movie buff, you probably couldn’t appreciate it or enjoy it. But if you were, you understood the references and saw the effort the writers and animators put in, to recapture the movies you grew up loving and remembering…but they did it with clever humour that wouldn’t offend you. But the best element of this show was that Jay Sherman would review films honestly. And even though he loved classic cinema and original story telling, he would still be honest and say he didn’t like it. It’s just a shame real life critics and reviewers cannot do the same"". Reception. ""The Critic"" originally received mixed to positive reviews when it first aired. In 1994, The Chicago Sun-Times gave a typical review of the show with, ""Jay Sherman, the eponymous culture vulture of ""The Critic,"" would undoubtedly say his new animated comedy on ABC 'stinks'. Fortunately for him Critic smells pretty good to me"". The show has since developed a cult following, with much of it coming through the show's weekend reruns on Comedy Central up until about 2005. The DVD set also got many positive reviews, such as one from Animated Views (which gave it an overall rating of 10/10), and on TV.com where the series has a user rating of 8.5 based on 625 votes. Mike Reiss' favourite episode is the Siskel and Ebert one. In September 2006, IGN ranked ""The Critic"" 9th in their list of the ""Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time"". In January 2009, they ranked the show 26th in their other list of the ""Top 100 Best Animated TV Series"". IN the latter article, IGN said: ""Of all the projects completed by ex-Saturday Night Live players, The Critic is the most fully realized, hilarious and heartwarming. It took its cues from Woody Allen movies like Annie Hall and Manhattan, and offered up a style of random abstract humor that wouldn't really be seen again until Family Guy"". In December 2011, Complex ranked the show 6th in their list of ""The 25 Most Underrated Animated TV Shows Of All Time"". People Magazine gave it a B, saying ""This animated series is slyly amusing when sticking it to showbiz, taking sarcastic swipes at everyone from Steven Seagal to Gene Shalit. At its best, it's still several strides behind the savage, protean wit of The Simpsons, and the humor sputters when the focus is personal"". Of the third season, IGN said ""I was thrilled to find out that Gracie Films has started producing new episodes of the cancelled ABC/Fox/Comedy Central show The Critic -- and for web cartoons that don't depend on the violence/swear cop-out for the humor, the shows are actually really well produced."" Home media. Responding to the success of DVD sales of ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpsons"", Sony Home Entertainment decided to release ""The Critic"" on DVD in early 2004, including the two regular seasons and the web episodes. The show achieved good sales, jumping onto the DVD list at 14 on Amazon, and quickly going through five issuings. "
wikipedia-796291," Timescape  Timescape is a 1980 novel by science fiction writer Gregory Benford (with unbilled co-author Hilary Foister). It won the 1980 Nebula and British Science Fiction Awards, and the 1981 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. The novel was widely hailed by both critics of science fiction and mainstream literature for its fusion of detailed character development and interpersonal drama with more standard science fiction fare such as time travel and ecological issues. Pocket Books used the title of this book for their science fiction imprint. Plot summary. The story is written from two viewpoints, equidistant from the novel's publication in 1980. The first thread is set in a 1998 ravaged by ecological disasters such as algal blooms and diebacks on the brink of large scale extinctions. Various other events are mentioned in passing, such as student riots and an event of nuclear terrorism against New York City which took place before the events of the novel. This thread follows a group of scientists in the United Kingdom connected with the University of Cambridge and their attempts to warn the past of the impending disaster by sending tachyon-induced messages to the astronomical position the Earth occupied in 1962–1963. Given the faster-than-light nature of the tachyon, these messages will effectively reach the past. These efforts are led by John Renfrew, an Englishman, and Gregory Markham, an American most likely modeled on Benford himself. Overseeing their efforts is Ian Peterson, a womanizing member of the World Council. The second thread is set in the University of California, San Diego, in La Jolla, California, in 1962 where a young scientist, Gordon Bernstein, discovers anomalous noise in a physics experiment relating to spontaneous resonance and indium antimonide. He and his student assistant, Albert Cooper (also likely based on the author and his experiences at UCSD), discover that the noise is coming in bursts timed to form Morse Code.  The resulting message is made of staccato sentence fragments and jumbled letters, due to the 1998 team's efforts to avoid a grandfather paradox. Their aim is to give the past researchers enough information to start efforts on solving the pending ecological crisis, but not enough that the crisis will be entirely solved (thus making a signal to the past unnecessary and creating a paradox). Due to the biological nature of the message, Professor Bernstein shares the message with a professor of biology, Michael Ramsey. Since the message also gives astronomical coordinates, he also shares it with Saul Shriffer, a fictional scientist who is said to have worked with Frank Drake on Project Ozma. Initially, these characters fail to understand the true meaning of the message. Ramsey believes it to be an intercepted military dispatch hinting at Soviet bioterrorism, while Shriffer thinks the message is of extraterrestrial origin. Shriffer goes public with this theory, mentioning Bernstein in his findings. However, Bernstein's overseer, Isaac Lakin, is skeptical of the messages and wants Bernstein to keep working on his original project and ignore the signal. As a result of this interruption in their experimentation, Bernstein is denied a promotion and Cooper fails a candidacy examination. The signal also exacerbates difficulties in Bernstein's relationship with his girlfriend, Penny. In 1998, Peterson recovers a safe deposit box in La Jolla containing a piece of paper indicating that the messages were received. Meanwhile, it is clear that the viral nature of the algal bloom is spreading it faster and through more mediums than originally expected. Strange yellow clouds that have been appearing are said to be a result of the viral material being absorbed through the water cycle, and it soon affects the planet's agriculture as well, resulting in widespread cases of food poisoning. Flying to the United States, Markham is killed in a plane crash when the pilots fly too close to one of the clouds and experience seizures. In the past storyline, now advanced into 1963, Bernstein refuses to give up on the signals. He is rewarded when the signal noise is also observed in a laboratory at Columbia University. Using hints in the message, Ramsey replicates the conditions of the bloom in a controlled experiment and realizes the danger it represents. Bernstein finds out that the astronomical coordinates given in the message represent where the Earth will be in 1998 due to the solar apex. He also receives a more coherent, despairing message from the future. Having built a solid case, Bernstein goes public and publishes his results.  This decision has monumental consequences. On November 22, a high school student in Dallas is sent by his physics teacher to the Texas School Book Depository to get a copy of Bernstein's findings. There he interrupts Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination attempt on President John F. Kennedy, attacking the shooter and sending the would-be fatal third shot awry. Though seriously injured, Kennedy survives. This paradox creates an alternate universe and forever ends the contact with the original 1998. The concluding chapters portray the 1998 of the original timeline as a bleak, failing world, the intensified ecological disaster taking a noticeable toll on the human way of life. Peterson retreats to a fortified country farmhouse which he has obviously prepared well in advance. Renfrew continues to send out signals (including the more coherent one that Gordon receives) until the building's generator gives out. Before it does, however, he receives a signal purportedly from the year 2349. In the final chapter, set in the alternate 1974, an awards ceremony is held for achievement in science. In light of Kennedy's survival, the United States President giving out the awards is William Scranton, who is said to have defeated Bobby Kennedy due to a telephone tapping scandal. The scientists whose work stemmed from the signal are honored, including Bernstein, who receives the Enrico Fermi Prize for his discovery of the tachyon. "
wikipedia-1494749," Mitchell and Webb  Mitchell and Webb are a British comedy double act, composed of David Mitchell (born 14 July 1974) and Robert Webb (born 29 September 1972). They are best known for starring in the Channel 4 sitcom ""Peep Show"" and their award-winning sketch show ""That Mitchell and Webb Look"". The duo first met at the Footlights in 1993 and collaborated for the 1995 Revue whilst studying at Cambridge University. Works. Television and radio. After graduating from university, the duo did two-man shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and some sketch writing, including a series of ""Big Train"" and also for Armstrong and Miller's eponymous show. Their big break came in 2000 when they joined the writing team for the BBC Two sketch show ""Bruiser"". The following year, the short-lived Play UK channel invited them to write their own sketch show, ""The Mitchell and Webb Situation"". Despite the low ratings of the channel, the show was reasonably well received by viewers. After the success, they wrote and starred in the Radio 4 sketch show, ""That Mitchell and Webb Sound"" – which was later adapted for television on BBC Two as ""That Mitchell and Webb Look"". The first series of ""That Mitchell and Webb Look"" won the BAFTA for ""Best Comedy Programme"" in 2007.  They often appear with Olivia Colman, James Bachman, Mark Evans and Paterson Joseph.  In 2008, the duo wrote a pilot script for their first original sitcom; in ""Playing Shop"", the two star as Eric and Jamie, friends who set up a business together after they are made redundant from their old jobs. Hartswood Films recorded the pilot episode on 20 December, with a view to producing a full series for BBC Two. Although approved by BBC, plans for future episodes fell through as Mitchell and Webb decided not to proceed with it.  Mitchell and Webb collaborated with Armstrong and Miller again for the 2009 Red Nose Day fundraising event. They co-wrote and starred in two short sketches incorporating Armstrong and Miller's iconic World War II airmen characters from ""The Armstrong and Miller Show"" and their characters Sir Digby and Ginger from their radio show ""That Mitchell and Webb Sound"". In 2012, the pair provided the voices for the pair of robots in the ""Doctor Who"" episode ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"". Other. Mitchell and Webb have also appeared in the short-lived U.K. regional versions of the 'Get a Mac' advertisements for Apple. They also voiced a pair of peas on the Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway sponsorship adverts for Birds Eye. ""Magicians"", a film starring the pair was released on 18 May 2007. They have also released the book ""This Mitchell and Webb Book"". "
wikipedia-5374327," Interim analysis  Clinical trials are unique in that enrollment of patients is a continual process staggered in time. This means that if a treatment is particularly beneficial or harmful compared to the concurrent placebo group while the study is on-going, the investigators are ethically obliged to assess that difference using the data at hand and to make a deliberate consideration of terminating the study earlier than planned.  Statistical methods of interim analysis. The design of many clinical trials includes some strategy for early stopping if an interim analysis reveals large differences between treatment groups. In addition to saving time and resources, such a design feature can reduce study participants' exposure to the inferior treatment. However, when repeated significance testing on accumulating data is done, some adjustment of the usual hypothesis testing procedure must be made to maintain an overall significance level (Armitage, McPherson & Rowe, 1969; McPherson & Armitage, 1971). The methods described by Pocock (1977) and O'Brien & Fleming (1979), among others, are popular implementations of group sequential testing for clinical trials. Sometimes interim analyses are equally spaced in terms of calendar time or the information available from the data, but this assumption can be relaxed to allow for unplanned or unequally spaced analyses, It is a tool used for statistical purpose. Example for Interim analysis and early termination , MADIT II trial. The second Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT II) was conducted to help better identify patients with coronary heart disease who would benefit from an ICD. MADIT II is the latest in a series of trials involving the use of ICDs to improve management and clinical treatment of arrhythmia patients. The Antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) Trial compared ICDs with antiarrhythmic-drug therapy (amiodarone or sotalol, predominantly the former) in patients who had survived life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. After inclusion of 1,232 patients, the MADIT II study was terminated when interim analysis showed significant (31%) reduction in all-cause death in patients assigned to ICD therapy. "
wikipedia-17238099," RIM-174 Standard ERAM  The RIM-174 Standard Extended Range Active Missile (ERAM), or Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) is a missile in current production for the United States Navy. It was designed for extended range anti-air warfare (ER-AAW) purposes providing capability against fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and anti-ship cruise missiles in flight, both over sea and land. The missile uses the airframe of the earlier SM-2ER Block IV (RIM-156A) missile, adding the active radar homing seeker from the AIM-120C AMRAAM in place of the semi-active seeker of the previous design. This will improve the capability of the Standard missile against highly agile targets, and targets beyond the effective range of the launching vessels' target illumination radars. Initial operating capability is planned for 2013. Description. The Standard ERAM is a two stage missile with a booster stage and a second stage. It is similar in appearance to the RIM-156A Standard missile. The radar seeker is an enlarged version adapted from the AIM-120C AMRAAM seeker (13.5 inches versus 7 inches). The missile may be employed in a number of modes: inertial guided to target with terminal acquisition using active radar seeker, semi-active radar homing all the way, or an over the horizon shot with cooperative engagement capability. The missile is also capable of terminal ballistic missile defense as a supplement to the SM-3 missile. Unlike other missiles of the Standard family, the ERAM can be periodically tested and certified without removal from the VLS cell. History. Raytheon entered a contract in 2004 to develop this missile for the United States Navy, after the cancellation of the SM-2ER Block IVA (RIM-156B) missile. Development started in 2005, followed by testing in 2007. The missile was officially designated RIM-174A in February 2008. Initial low rate production was authorized in 2009. Raytheon received a $93 million contract to begin production of the RIM-174A in September 2009. The first low-rate production missile was delivered in March 2011. SM-6 was approved for full-rate production in May 2013 and the first full-production missile will be delivered in April 2015. "
wikipedia-729789," Mozarabic Rite  The Mozarabic Rite, also called the Visigothic Rite or Hispanic Rite, is a form of Catholic worship within the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, and in the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church. Its beginning dates to the 7th century, and is localized in the Iberian Peninsula (Hispania). The ""Mozarabs"" is a scholarly term for the Christians living under Muslim rulers in Al-Andalus. The Mozarabic Rite's origins predates the Al-Andalus and Visigothic periods. The rite was superseded by the Roman Rite as part of a wider programme of liturgical standardization within the Catholic Church. Formation of early Catholic rites. Ritual worship surrounding the Eucharist in the early Church was not scripted with precise rubrics as is the norm today. One of the earliest known documents setting down the nature of Eucharistic celebration is the Didache, dating from 70–140 (see historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology). Few details are known of early forms of the liturgy, or worship, in the first three centuries, but there was some diversity of practice; Justin Martyr, however gave one example of the early Christian Liturgy in one of his apologies. As Christianity gained dominance in the wake of the conversion of Constantine I early in the fourth century, there was a period of liturgical development as the communities emerged from smaller gatherings to large assemblies in public halls and new churches. This time of development saw the combination of embellishment of existing practices with the exchange of ideas and practices from other communities. These mutual processes resulted both in greater diversity and in certain unifying factors within the liturgy from the merging of forms throughout major cities and regions. The liturgies of the patriarchal cities in particular had greater influence on their regions so that by the 5th century it becomes possible to distinguish among several families of liturgies, in particular the Jerusalem, Alexandrian, Antiochene, Byzantine, and Syrian families in the East, and in the Latin West, the African (completely lost), Gallican, Celtic, Ambrosian, Roman, and Hispanic (Mozarabic) families. These settled into fairly stable forms that continued to evolve, but none without some influence from outside. In the West, however, the liturgy in Roman Africa was lost as the Church there was weakened by internal division and then the Vandal invasion, and then was extinguished in the wake of the Islamic ascendancy. In Gaul, the fascination of the Franks with Roman liturgy led them to begin adopting the Roman Rite, a process that was confirmed and promoted by Charlemagne as an aid to imperial unity. The Catholic liturgical practice in Iberia prior to the Visigoths is termed ""Old Hispanic"", and inaccurately is often called Mozarabic. There was a liturgical tradition in Hispania prior to the arrival of the Visigoths as evidenced by the fact that it lacks Arian influence. This liturgy reached its point of greatest development in the 7th century in the time the Visigoths ruled Hispania and is found partly in the ""Verona Orationale"", taken to Italy for safekeeping after the invasion of Muslims (below). Terminological confusion regarding the liturgical development in this area is common, and most names proposed bear a degree of inaccuracy; hence qualifications are the norm in the discussion of this history. The most precise use of the term ""Mozarabic rite"" is for that liturgy followed by the inhabitants of former visigothic Hispania who submitted to Islamic rule and their descendants. St. Isidore of Seville (d. 636), who was influential at the Fourth Council of Toledo in 633, according to the wishes of that Council, gave the Hispanic rite its final form before the Muslim invasion. As the Christian kingdoms reconquered Hispania, the kings sought to re-establish Church links to the rest of Europe and the Papacy. The papacy wanted to standardise the Church liturgy and imposed the Roman Rite but the Mozarabic rite continued to be used in Toledo and León. The Mozarabic rite was approved by Pope John X in 918, suppressed by Pope Gregory VII in 1085 yet permitted in six parishes. Unity in liturgical practice was strongly encouraged by Rome and after re-conquest typically the Roman rite was installed. Eventually the Mozarabic rite became a memorial service, as people grew to accept the Roman rite. Gallican, Mozarabic, and Roman rite connections. There is evidence that the Mozarabic rite is tied to the Gallican rite, given common points of construction. Schaff argues for an Oriental element in both the Gallican and the Mozarabic (or Old Hispanic), while Jenner quotes Dom Marius Férotin, O.S.B., who writes that the framework of the liturgy is from Italy or Rome, while various details such as hymns are from Iberia, Africa, and Gaul. Jenner states that there is no extant concrete information about the Old Hispanic liturgy prior to the end of the 6th century, a point echoed by Cabrol. Michael Davies reports that it is commonly believed that the Gallican rite came from the East, perhaps Antioch, and through Italy influenced the West. The work of St. Isidore, who was asked by a Council of Toledo (probably the one occurring in 633) to revise and rearrange the liturgy of the time (Old Hispanic), leaves us a number of documents demonstrating liturgical stability prior to the Muslim invasion. Cabrol lists several liturgical points of Oriental origin (""the place of the diptychs, the Kiss of Peace, and even the 'epiclesis'"") while indicating the liturgical commonalities to the entire West, including Rome and Gaul. Cabrol also indicates that the Mozarabic rite contains some customs that ante-date those of Rome. Preservation and relevance of the Mozarabic rite. The Mozarabic Rite is the second-best attested liturgy in the Latin Church in terms of preserved documentation. The Mozarabic Rite was considered authoritative for the clarification of a Sacramentary received by Charlemagne from Pope Adrian I (d. 795). The first is, of course, the Roman Rite, which, to encourage unity of faith and worship, generally replaced the Mozarabic in Iberia from about 1080. In the year 870, Charles the Bald, wishing to see what the ancient Gallican Rite had been like, had priests sent from Spain to celebrate the Mozarabic Rite before him. In the latter part of the eighth century, the Rite had fallen under some suspicion owing to quotations cited by Elipandus of Toledo in support of his Adoptianist theories, and the Council of Frankfurt 794 spoke somewhat disparagingly of possible Islamic influence on it. It was due to these suspicions that in 924, John X sent a Papal Legate named Zanello to investigate the Rite. Zanello spoke favourably of the Rite, and the Pope gave a new approbation to it, requiring only to change the words of consecration to that of the Roman one. Spanish clergy gradually started to use the Roman words of institution (though there is no evidence whether or not it was done consistently). When King Alfonso VI of Castile conquered Toledo in 1085, it was being disputed as to which rite Iberian Christians should follow: the Roman rite or Mozarabic Rite. After other ordeals, it was submitted to the trial by fire: One book for each rite was thrown into a fire. The Toledan book was little damaged whilst the Roman one was consumed. (Another story has both books survive: the Toledan book was not burned while the Roman missal was ejected from the fire.) Henry Jenner comments in the Catholic Encyclopedia: ""No one who has seen a Mozarabic manuscript with its extraordinarily solid vellum, will adopt any hypothesis of Divine Interposition here."" The king allowed six parishes in the city to continue to use the Mozarabic rite.  Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros (d. 1517) published in 1500 a Mozarabic missal, and two years later a breviary, both of which were formally approved by Pope Julius II. To perfect the presentation of the liturgy Jiménez interpolated elements of the Roman Rite as then used in Iberia, particularly the preliminary prayers for the Mass. He also instituted a chapel in the Cathedral of Toledo, with a college of thirteen priests to use the Roman Missal and Breviary. This continues to the present day, in spite of vicissitudes that included the killing of all the priests of the group in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War.  The texts prepared by Jiménez were republished at various times. The dawn of the twentieth century saw an intensification of studies of the rite and the publication of its manuscript sources. In response to the encouragement given by the Second Vatican Council in ""Sacrosanctum Concilium"", 3-4 to renew other rites as well as the Roman, the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo Marcelo González Martín set up a commission to revise the liturgical books of the Mozarabic rite. Between 1988 and 1995, the Missal (in two volumes), the Lectionary (also in two volumes), and a vernacular (Castilian) version of the Ordinary of the Mass appeared, with the required approval of the Spanish bishops conference and confirmation by the Holy See. The Mozarabic Rite is celebrated daily in the Corpus Christi Chapel (also called the Mozarabic Chapel) in the Cathedral of Toledo. In Madrid Mozarabic or Gothic Rite is celebrated in Spanish every Tuesday (Pº Recoletos 11 Monastery of Poor Clare Sisters, 19' 00 h). Two of the original six ""Mozarabic"" parishes of Toledo remain. About two hundred families in Toledo belong to these parishes and form an association of those who can claim that their families have always belonged to Mozarabic Rite. Additionally, all the churches of Toledo annually celebrate this rite on the Mozarabic Feast of the Incarnation on December 18, and on the feast day of Saint Ildephonsus on January 23. The rite is also used on certain days each year in the Talavera Chapel of the Old Cathedral of Salamanca and less regularly in other cities in Spain. Pope John Paul II celebrated it once in each of the years 1992 and 2000.  The Mozarabic Rite has been of interest to non-Catholic communions as well. For example, in the 1880s the Anglican Communion examined the Mozarabic rite for ideas about making their own liturgy more inspiring, and at present the aforementioned Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church employs it for the celebration of all sacraments. The Spanish custom of the bridegroom giving his bride thirteen coins after exchanging their nuptial vows during the marriage ceremony (also observed in the former Spanish colonies in the New World and in Hispanic Catholic parishes in the United States and Canada) has its origins in the Mozarabic rite.  The oldest Western manuscript written on paper is the Mozarabic Missal of Silos, from the eleventh century. Mozarabic rite a lesson in evolution of rites. After the early period of persecutions came to an end, Christians began to develop more elaborate forms of worship, perhaps because it became possible to store and share rubrical ideas over time and geography, and because love for Christ inspired greater elaboration. Liturgical variety has always been assumed, by the Church, to be permissible in small details that do not touch upon articles of faith or morals. This variety is a natural result of the Church, i.e. the body of faithful, being in ""a dialogue of love"" with Jesus: this is how forms of worship are perceived by the Church—which can authoritatively, but not arbitrarily, ""define and limit the usage of rites"" (quotes from Ratzinger). G. S. Lee writes that the Church is always eager to ""recognize the varying wants of her spiritual children, and to shape her devotional exercises in conformity to these"".The Council of Toledo affirmed it to be ""a form of worship grateful to the people"" and the Council of Mantua, 1067, declared it to be free of heresy and ""also worthy of praise"". Character of Mozarabic rite. While the liturgy used during the period of Islamic rule was very much like that to which St. Isidore put some finishing touches in the 7th century. During Islamic rule the pastors took more care, where practice of Christianity was permitted, to address the faithful during the Mass. The Bible was translated into Arabic during this period as well, and the liturgy was celebrated in Arabic.  The Mozarabic Rite is longer in duration than that of the Roman Rite. Imagery and ceremony are used extensively; its great beauty is shown in the support it received even after the Roman Rite was installed throughout Iberia. Many learned theologians have praised it. Many hymns were written within the Mozarabic Rite.  The Mozarabic Rite may have emphasized the Blessed Virgin Mary's role even more than did the liturgy of Rome. It also exalts Mary by addressing her directly in prayer, which the Roman Rite does not do.  The Mozarabic Rite was the first to use ashes within the liturgical celebrations of the Church. Ashes were used prior to the Mozarabic Rite, but this was done outside of liturgical events, e.g., marking people for penance. The Breviary has a short and uncomplicated extra office (session of prayer) before the main morning office. Extensive use is made of responsories between the celebrant (priest) and faithful during the Mozarabic Mass, including during the ""Confiteor"" (prayer of confession of guilt for sin), which is quite different from that in the Roman Rite (Tridentine or post-Tridentine); though much of the preparatory prayers and other elements in the old Missal were borrowed from a Romano-Toledan Missal and is not originally part of the rite. Isidore of Seville in his writings made reference to the 'seven prayers' of the Mozarabic Mass. These are the seven major variable liturgical texts which constitute the essential prayer formulas said by the celebrant in the Mozarabic liturgy of the faithful, namely: 1. The ""Oratio Missae"" or Prayer of the Mass, an opening prayer making reference to the feast being celebrated and in general character much like the Roman Collect. 2. The Prayer after the Names, said immediately after the recitation of the names of the faithful, living and dead, who are being prayed for. 3. Prayer for Peace, said immediately before the kiss of peace. 4. The ""Illatio"" corresponding to the Roman Preface and most frequently the longest part of the Mozarabic eucharistic prayer. 5. The Post-Sanctus, the part of the Mozarabic eucharistic prayer connecting the Sanctus with the institution narrative. 6. The Post-Pridie, the concluding portion of the eucharistic prayer including the anamnesis with its prayer of offering, the epiklesis, (when either or both of these are present) and the final doxology. 7. The Lord's Prayer with its variable introduction and fixed embolism and concluding clause. While the liturgy is quite beautiful, it also tended toward ""prolixity"" and at times was lacking in ""sobriety"". The Roman rite of Mass is more ordered: in its Tridentine form it left almost nothing to the choice of the celebrant; the present (Mass of Paul VI), though it limits extemporaneous variations to the words of introduction to certain ceremonies, frequently allows a choice between different formulas of prayer. This may be due to the influence of the Mozarabic rite. There was no fixed ""anaphora"" or Eucharistic prayer in the Mozarabic rite of Mass, which permitted a fair degree of extemporaneous flexibility. When the Mozarabic rite was given a new lease on life in 1500, the Roman words of institution, the key words that Jesus used at the Last Supper, were required. Originally, the Mozarabic words of institution were from St. Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians (11:24), with the formula for the consecration of the wine being a combination of 1 Corinthians 11:24, Luke 22:20, and Matthew 26:28. These were the words written on the (old) Mozarabic Missal, though the Roman formula was included as a footnote in the Missal and was used in actual practice in place of the old Spanish formula (note, however, that it was reinstituted by the modern Mozarabic Missal). Some Eucharistic prayers are addressed to Christ rather than to God the Father. After the consecration of the bread and wine (see Eucharist), as the Creed is being chanted, the host (the real presence of Christ under the species of bread) is broken into nine pieces, each representing a facet of Christ's life on earth, seven of which are arranged in a cross on the paten. After a variable introduction the Lord's Prayer was said by the celebrant alone, with everyone else responding ""Amen"" to each petition, except for the petition for daily bread, for which the response is ""For you are God"" and everyone concluding the final petition, ""but deliver us from evil"" with the celebrant. The Mozarabic Eucharistic Prayer for the Nativity of Christ. In this translation of the Mozarabic eucharistic prayer for the Nativity of Christ we have a representative example of the texts of this liturgical tradition at its best. It is meet and right for us to render to Thine omnipotence and goodness, the praises which Thou hast given us the power to render, O Merciful Father, because after long ages, as on this day not long ago, Christ Jesus, Who was one with Thee or with Himself, was born to us. Thine Only-Begotten was made son of His handmaid; the Lord was born of His Mother; the Shoot of Mary is the Fruit of the Church, and He Who comes forth as a weakling babe by the One, is magnified by the other as a worker of wonders.  Mary begat salvation for the nations, the Church begat the nations; the one carried life in her womb; the other in the font. In the body of the one was Christ conceived, in the waters of the other is Christ put on. Through the one He, Who ever was, is born; through the other, he who had perished is found. In the one the Redeemer of the Nations receives life; in the other the nations themselves are made alive. Through the one He came that He might take away sins; through the other He took away those sins on account of which He came. Through the one He wept for us; through the other He cared for us. In the one He is an infant; in the other He is a giant. There He weeps, here He triumphs. Through the one He played with toys; through the other He subdued kingdoms. The one He soothed with a child's merriment; the other He bound with the faith of a husband. Then at last appear the pure interchanges of precious love. The husband gives to His spouse His gifts of living water, that is, Christ to the Church, with which she might be washed to find favour in His sight. For the oil of gladness He gave to her the sweet-smelling oil of chrism by which she might be anointed. He called her to His table, and satisfied her with the fat of corn, and filled her with the wine of sweetness. He placed upon her the ornament of justice, and gave her a vesture glittering with many virtues. He gave His life for her, and when about to reign as Victor, He gave to her as dowry the spoils of Death captured and trampled underfoot. To her He gave Himself for food and drink and raiment. He promised that He would give to her an eternal kingdom, and that she should stand as Queen upon His right hand. To her He granted what had been bestowed upon the Mother; to be filled, but not violated, to bring forth, but not defiled. To the Mother was this a single gift; to the Church for all time. So might she repose as His bride on the couch of loveliness, and multiply sons from the bosom of pure love, and might be fecund with offspring yet not fretid with lust. So she herself made rich in Him and through Him brings lowly gifts to her Husband and Lord; This, of her own, offering her faith; This, from His example, offering a responsive love; This, of His own gift, that she could accomplish even what He willed, and even what she accomplished. She gave to Him martyrs for roses, virgins instead of lilies, the chaste as violets. All these gifts she transmitted to Him through the Apostles, the ministers of His will, as the finished tasks of her work. Wherefore now she stands upon His right hand in eternal happiness and glory, and praises Him Who reigns with Thee, O Omnipotent Father, and the Holy Spirit, with all Angels confessing Him and saying---Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts. Heaven and Earth are full of the glory of Thy Majesty. Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is He who cometh in the Name of the Lord. Hosanna in the Highest. Truly Holy, Truly blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ Thy Son; Who came from Heaven that He might have His consecration upon earth, and was made flesh that He might dwell amongst us. He Himself our Lord and Eternal Redeemer. For the Lord Jesus, in the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread and gave thanks and broke and said: TAKE, AND EAT: THIS IS MY BODY,WHICH IS GIVEN FOR YOU. DO THIS FOR MY MEMORIAL. Likewise also He took the cup, when He had supped and gave thanks and gave it to them, sayingTHIS CUP IS THE NEW COVENANT IN MY BLOOD, WHICH IS FOR YOU AND FOR MANY IS SHED FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS. AND WHEN YE SHALL DRINK IT, THIS SHALL YE DO FOR MY MEMORIAL. (""Response"": ""Amen"") AND AS OFTEN AS YE SHALL EAT THIS BREAD AND DRINK THIS CUP, YE SHALL PROCLAIM THE LORD'S DEATH UNTIL HE COME INTO CLEAR SIGHT FROM THE HEAVENS. (""Response"": ""So we believe, Lord Jesus."") Observing, O Lord, these Thy gifts and commands, we placed upon Thine Altar these offerings of bread and wine, beseeching Thee in the abundance of Thy goodness and compassion, that by the power of that same Spirit by which uncorrupt virginity conceived Thee in the flesh, the Undivided Trinity may sanctify these oblations, so that, when they shall be received by us with no less fear than veneration, whatever there be of life harmful to the soul may wither, and that what has withered may in no wise live again. Amen. Who with God the Father and the Holy Spirit livest and reignest one God world without end. Amen. "
wikipedia-2146439," Terrax  Terrax the Tamer is a fictional character that appears in the comic books published by Marvel Comics.  Publication history. The character first appears in ""Fantastic Four"" #211 (Oct. 1979) and was created by Marv Wolfman and John Byrne. Fictional character biography. The Birth of a Herald. The character first appears as Tyros in the title ""Fantastic Four"", and is ruler of the city-state of Lanlak on the planetoid Birj. The cosmic entity Galactus selects Tyros as his next Herald, but first wishes for the superhero team the Fantastic Four to humble him. In return the cosmic entity agrees to travel to Earth to aid the heroes against a new threat, the villain Sphinx. Tyros is defeated, and brought before Galactus, who changes the petty tyrant into ""Terrax the Tamer"". His minor control over stone was augmented to an incalculable degree. Now, he could affect all matter of rock and stone on nearly a planetary scale. His body was changed so that it would withstand the vacuum of space. Finally, Galactus gave Terrax a weapon called the cosmic axe capable of generating waves of cosmic force. Terrax travels with Galactus to Earth, and while his new master battles the Sphinx, attacks the Fantastic Four - still resenting the heroes for their role in his transformation. Terrax, however, is tricked and defeated by the Human Torch, and leaves with a victorious Galactus. Rebellion. As Galactus's new herald, Terrax found more worlds for his master than any of the previous heralds. Terrax likened the discovery of new planets to the feeling of conquest. On several occasions, Terrax annihilated large segments of the population himself using his cosmic powers. As Galactus had hoped, Terrax's lack of morality made him a successful herald. But whereas Galactus's other heralds had a sense of loyalty to their master, Terrax had none. Indeed, he served Galactus out of fear for his master's power, but even conquered that fear on several occasions to defy Galactus' wishes. Shortly after being transformed into Galactus' herald, Terrax fled from his master and overthrew the ruling body of a small-unnamed planet. He enslaved the entire population and set himself up as the planet's deity. Huge segments of that world's people died erecting temples and cities to glorify Terrax. Terrax planned to use the survivors of his reign as the first wave of a planned universe conquering army. But before Terrax could proceed any further, Galactus summoned his herald. Fearful of his master's wrath, Terrax hid in a black hole. Utilizing the powers of the Earth mutant Dazzler, Galactus freed Terrax and made him obedient to his will again.  Terrax reappears in the title ""Rom"", and after leading Galactus to the planet Galador, battles its champion, Rom, and his fellow Spaceknight, Terminator.  But Terrax's rebellious nature could not be totally stifled, and after a while, Terrax again fled his master. This time, he went to Earth. Utilizing his power, Terrax levitated the entire island of Manhattan into earth orbit and used the lives of its millions of inhabitants to bargain with the Fantastic Four. To spare Manhattan, Terrax demanded that they destroy Galactus by attacking his ship. Galactus had by now realized that his herald had become a liability to him, Returning Manhattan to Earth, Galactus stripped Terrax of his cosmic power and the transformed alien was sent hurtling from the top of the World Trade Center down to the street below. Although seriously injured, Terrax's alien physique enabled him to survive the fall. An unidentified passerby took Terrax's broken form, unknown to both the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, who were present at the site, to a nearby hospital. He remained there for several months in a semi comatose state. Victor Von Doom, looking for a pawn to use in a plot against the Fantastic Four, discovered that Terrax had survived. Terrax was kidnapped from the hospital and brought back to Doom's kingdom of Latveria by a squad of robots dispatched by Doom. There, after six weeks of Doom's advanced treatments, Terrax recovered. But, having been stripped of cosmic power, Terrax had no memories of having been the herald of Galactus, and thus called himself Tyros once more. Doom had recently perfected a device that was capable of endowing an individual with limited cosmic power. Tyros readily agreed to be exposed to the device's energies, as he wished revenge against the Fantastic Four. Garbed in a special suit that would channel and regulate the cosmic energies in his body, Tyros set off for New York. Unknown to him, the power Doom gave him would consume Tyros's body within a matter of hours. Thus, Doom would not be faced with an adversary whose power was vaster than his own, once Tyros had served his purpose. Tyros defeated the Fantastic Four and, detesting the fact he was in the service of any master, he turned on Doom and immobilized the Latverian monarch in his armor. At Tyros's moment of seeming triumph, the Silver Surfer, the first of Galactus's heralds, arrived to save the lives of his friends. Tyros believed that his power level was equal to that of the Surfer's, but he soon learned that he was no match for someone who had received the Power Cosmic from Galactus himself. Tyros was forced to use his powers to their limit in order to combat the Surfer. This only served to hasten his inevitable deterioration. As the two former heralds of Galactus engaged in battle, Tyros was totally consumed by the Power Cosmic. In an ""Avengers"" annual the character is temporarily resurrected to become a member of the second Legion of the Unliving by the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster. Tyros reforms his physical form as Terrax in the title ""New Warriors"", and battles the fledgling superhero team. Terrax is defeated when the heroes, deducing that his form is unstable and that constant contact with earth is required, separate him and thereby his form. Terrax reappears when reformed once again by a rogue scientist attempting to steal his power. He uses the scientist as a host body and again battles the New Warriors and Fantastic Four. The Silver Surfer intervenes and maroons Terrax on the deserted planet Pluraris IV.  Terrax features in the third volume of the ""Silver Surfer"" when asked to join his fellow Heralds against the threat of Galactus' latest Herald, Morg. After Morg's defeat, Terrax claims the character's axe. Morg eventually wishes to retrieve his weapon and battles Terrax until both are briefly captured - together with several other extraterrestrial characters Gladiator and Beta Ray Bill - by the entity Tyrant. Terrax guest stars in the limited series ""Cosmic Powers"", in which Tyrant is confronted and thwarted by the Titan Thanos. After a battle with fellow Heralds the Surfer and Nova (actually the demon Mephisto in disguise) in the title ""Silver Surfer"", the character goes into hiding until he featured in the second ""Sentry"" limited series. Terrax appears in the ""Annihilation"" storyline, being initially captured by the forces of Annihilus before escaping with the Alien Skrull Paibok. Terrax later finds a world ruled by the Space Parasite, whom he eventually kills. On discovering that the inhabitants are content to live in subservience, he flies into a rage and destroys the planet. In the title ""Hulk"", Terrax is plucked from continuity by the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster to be part of a team called the Offenders in a bid to thwart the Hulk. Death. Terrax later returns to his birth planet Birj where he's approached by one member of the Nova Corps, who had come to give a warning to Terrax and is helping in the evacuation of the planet. Terrax briefly fights him and refuses to evacuate the planet. Nova runs away as the threat he warned Terrax about arrives. As Nova leaves the planet, he sees the Phoenix Force completely consumming the planet Birj on its way through the universe, taking Terrax and all its population with it. Powers and abilities. Tyros is an alien with a genetic mutation that gives him a limited mental ability to manipulate the molecules of rock and earth. After being transformed by the cosmic power of Galactus, the character can perform feats as fine as manipulating sand and as grand as causing volcanic eruptions and moving asteroids; meteors, and planetary masses from space at high speeds; shift tectonic plates to cause earthquakes and create chasms, and levitate large land masses miles into the air. Like all Heralds, Terrax possesses superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes and durability; energy projection; force fields; warp speed and is immune to the rigors of space. The character further possesses a cosmic scythe which he sometimes directs his energy attacks through. Other versions. MC2. A future version of Terrax appears in alternate universe the MC2 title, ""Fantastic Five"". Terrax the Truly Enlightened. In this reality Terrax was also a herald of Galaktus, and called himself ""Terrax the Truly Enlightened"". When this Earth started to collide with Earth-616, the Illuminati, who had gathered together once again to stop this mysterious event known as The Incursion, traveled to that reality to see if they could save the people there before destroying the world. They found that Terrax had already guided Galaktus of that universe Earth to destroy it in hopes to save his universe. Terrax demanded the Illuminati to retreat to their home-reality, however, they ended up fighting him. Terrax was eventually defeated and captured but not in time to stop Galaktus, who consumed the Earth and averted the Incursion. Terrax was taken to Earth-616 and was imprisoned in the Necropolis of Wakanda in a cell next to Black Swan's, where she later stated that they would have interest to team-up soon. "
wikipedia-5063696," Jim Sharman  James ""Jim"" Sharman (born 12 March 1945 in Sydney, Australia), the son of boxing tent entrepreneur Jimmy Sharman, is a director and writer for film and stage with over 70 productions to his credit. He is renowned in Australia for his work as a theatre director from the 1960s to the present, but is probably best known internationally as the director of the 1973 theatrical hit ""The Rocky Horror Show"", ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (1975) and its follow-up ""Shock Treatment"" (1981). Biography. James David Sharman was born in 1945 in Sydney, Australia, to James Michael Sharman (1912–2006) and Christina McAndleish Sharman (1914–2003). Sharman was educated in Sydney, though his upbringing included time spent on Australian showgrounds where his father and grandfather ran a travelling sideshow of popular legend: Jimmy Sharman's Boxing Troupe. This brought him into contact with the world of circus and travelling vaudeville. Developing an interest in theatre, he graduated from the production course at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney in 1966. Sharman created a series of ground-breaking productions of experimental theatre, many for the Old Tote Theatre Company, culminating in a controversial staging of Mozart's ""Don Giovanni"" for Opera Australia at the age of 21. Over the following decade, he directed three rock musicals that defined their era: ""Hair"" in 1969 (Sydney, Melbourne, Tokyo, Boston) (he also designed the original Sydney production); ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" in 1972 (Australia and Palace Theatre, London) and created the original production of ""The Rocky Horror Show"" with Richard O'Brien in 1973 (Royal Court Theatre, London – subsequently in Sydney, Los Angeles, Melbourne, New York City). He cowrote the screenplay and directed the international cult hit film ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (1975) for Twentieth Century Fox, and directed its loosely based sequel ""Shock Treatment"" in 1981. In 1985, he directed third year students at NIDA in the production of ""Dreamplay"".  In the following decades, and often working in conjunction with designer Brian Thomson (a partnership that began at the Old Tote), Sharman directed a series of new works and Australian premieres, including a series of productions of plays by Patrick White in the late 1970s – ""The Season at Sarsaparilla"", ""Big Toys"", ""Netherwood"" and ""A Cheery Soul"" - which are credited with reviving the Nobel Laureate's career as a dramatist. He also directed the film ""The Night the Prowler"", using a screenplay written by Patrick White. Sharman was Artistic Director of a transformational Adelaide Festival of Arts in 1982 and, while in South Australia, he created ""Lighthouse"", a theatre company that specialised in radical stagings of classics and premieres of new work by major Australian dramatists, including Louis Nowra, Stephen Sewell and Patrick White. The ensemble included many major Australian artists, including actors Geoffrey Rush, Gillian Jones, John Wood and Kerry Walker and associate director Neil Armfield, who would further develop this adventurous tradition at Sydney's Belvoir Street Theatre. Continuing as a freelance director, Sharman's most recent work has been Stephen Sewell's ""Three Furies"" - scenes from the life of Francis Bacon, for which he won a ""Helpmann Award"" for best direction. It played at the 2005 Sydney and Auckland Festivals and the 2006 Perth and Adelaide Festivals. In 2006, he revived his landmark staging of Benjamin Britten's ""Death In Venice"" for Opera Australia. In 2009, he will direct a new production of Mozart's ""Così fan tutte"" for Opera Australia, a collaboration with the Berlin-based Australian conductor Simon Hewett. In August 2008, Sharman's memoirs ""Blood and Tinsel"" were published by Melbourne University Publishing where he talks about his childhood on the road with Jimmy Sharman's Boxing Troupe and also speaks out for the first time about ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and his many productions. The website for ""Blood and Tinsel"" contains reviews and transcripts of interviews with Sharman that were undertaken in conjunction with the launch of the book. "
wikipedia-20035178," Manny Harris  Corperryale L'Adorable ""Manny"" Harris (born September 21, 1989) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Orlando Magic of the NBA. He is a former All-Big Ten Conference guard who played three seasons for the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. He decided to forgo his final year of collegiate eligibility and declare himself eligible for the 2010 NBA Draft, but went undrafted. Harris previously attended Redford High School in Detroit, Michigan, where he won the state's Mr. Basketball award as a senior. Harris is one of only five Big Ten Conference basketball players to have finished in the top ten in the conference in scoring, rebounding, and assist average in the same season and prior to Evan Turner's 2009-10 season, Harris' 2008-09 season was the only time a player had finished in the top six of all three categories. At Michigan, he was a 2008–09 first team All-Big Ten Conference selection, a 2007–08 second team All-Big Ten selection and a 2009–10 third team All-Big Ten selection. Harris also earned Big Ten Academic All-Conference honors as both a sophomore and a junior after the 2008–09 and 2009–10 Big Ten Conference regular seasons. Harris began the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season by recording the second triple double in school history. Harris went undrafted in 2010, he signed with the Cavaliers. He saw limited action for the team in the summer rookie league. However in preseason, he survived roster cuts to make the 15-man roster. As a rookie, he began the season either on the bench or inactive for some games, but eventually worked his way into the starting lineup for a brief period due to injuries before returning to a less active role. He began his second year injured and rehabbed for two months in the NBA D-League with Cavaliers' affiliate, the Canton Charge, before being re-signed by the Cavaliers. He was named to the Houston Rockets' 2012 NBA Summer League team, but signed with BC Azovmash of Ukraine in September 2012. High school. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Harris was a 2005 Class A All-State fifth team selection as a sophomore by ""The Detroit News"". He was an ""Associated Press"" Class A All-State first team selection in each of the next two seasons. Harris was selected as the 2007 Mr. Basketball of Michigan. That season he led the Redford to the Michigan High School Athletic Association Class A championship game, which it lost to Saginaw High School. During his high school basketball career, he became the first player to start for three consecutive Detroit Public School League championship teams since Jalen Rose and Voshon Lenard had done so from 1989 to 1991. At Redford, Harris once recorded 52 points and 15 rebounds. During the 2006–07 season, his last at Redford, Harris averaged 33.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists. Harris was highly recruited, receiving offers from Tennessee, UCLA, Wisconsin, George Washington, and Indiana before committing to the University of Michigan. He was ranked by Rivals.com as the sixth-best shooting guard in the country in the 2007 high school class, while Scout.com ranked him the twelfth-best shooting guard. ESPN ranked him #7, but they listed him as a point guard. When Michigan announced that it would replace Tommy Amaker with John Beilein as head coach, Harris was initially unsure if he would honor his signed letter of intent, but when Michigan re-signed assistant coach Mike Jackson, he again decided to attend the school. College. Freshman year. Prior to the 2007–08 basketball season, he was selected as a second team pre-season All-Big Ten Conference selection. After the 2007–08 NCAA basketball season, Harris was selected as a second team All-Big Ten Conference selection and an All-Freshman team selection. He led the Wolverines in scoring (16.4), assists (2.8), steals (1.5), minutes (32.9) and free throw percentage (82.0). Among his highlights during the season were being named to the Great Alaska Shootout tournament team, becoming the fourth U-M freshman to score over 500 points in first season (516), and setting the U-M freshman record for free throws made in a season while playing at least 20 minutes and starting every game. During the season, he keyed the first three game winning streak of the season for the team, which earned him his first Big Ten Player of the Week Award. Sophomore year. As a 2008–09 first team pre-season All-Big Ten player, he was the first Wolverine to earn the honor since Daniel Horton in 2004. Although he was the leading returning scorer and top draft prospect, Purdue's Robbie Hummel was named Big Ten Preseason Player of the Year. Preseason All-Big Ten status has not always led to regular season honors. In both 2005 and 2007, only two preseason selections made the regular season team. Harris opened the 2008–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball season with a career-high 30 points in a 77–55 victory over Michigan Tech on November 11. The following night in the second game of the Coaches vs. cancer classic, Harris nearly posted a triple double when he posted 26 points, and career-highs with 10 rebounds and 8 assists in a 76–56 win against Northeastern University. This quick start earned Harris the November 17, 2008 Big Ten Player of the Week Award. Harris led the Big Ten Conference in scoring until the second to last game of the preconference schedule when he snapped a ten-game double digit scoring streak. Throughout the season, he continued to battle with fellow sophomores Evan Turner and Talor Battle for the Big Ten scoring leadership. On February 5, Harris was selected along with Kalin Lucas as one of only two Big Ten John R. Wooden Award 2008–09 Midseason Top 30 Candidates. On March 5, the National Association of Basketball Coaches honored Harris as a District 7 (Big Ten) first-team selection along with four other sophomores (Lucas, Turner, Battle, and JaJuan Johnson). On March 9 after the conclusion of the 2008–09 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, he was named to the first team All-Big Ten by both the Big Ten coaches and the Big Ten media along with the same four sophomores. He was also chosen on March 10 by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association for its 2008–09 Men's Division I District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) Team, based on voting from its national membership. On March 26 Harris was honored as one of four Michigan men's basketball Winter Sports Big Ten Academic All-Conference selections. Iowa Hawkeyes freshman Matt Gatens completed the 2008–2009 season with 75/83 90.4% Free Throw shooting percentage in 32 games. However, a common threshold for eligibility for such a statistical championship is 2.5 free throws made per game and 75% of team games played, leaving him five free throws short of eligibility. Thus, Harris, at 86.3% (176/204), was the Big Ten leader among those with a qualifying number of attempts according to some sources. However, the Big Ten Conference recognizes only two Free Throws made per game as the threshold. Nonetheless, the NCAA recognizes a 2.5 attempts per game minimum. Thus, according to the Big Ten Gatens is the Conference Free Throw Champion and according the NCAA Harris is the champion. Harris led the Wolverines in points, minutes, assists and steals. Additionally, Harris finished one behind teammate DeShawn Sims for the team leadership rebounds. In the Big Ten, Harris ranked first (or second depending on the source) in free throw percentage, first in free throws made, second in points per game, fifth in assists per game, and sixth in rebounds per game. Harris and Evan Turner (who led the Big Ten in scoring) were the only Big Ten players to finish in the conference's top 10 in total points, rebounds, assists, and steals. They are the 4th and 5th players in conference history to finish in the top ten in average points, rebounds, and assists since assists became a statistic in 1983–84, following Steve Smith, Jim Jackson, and Brian Evans. Of these five, Harris was the only one to finish in the top six in each stat prior to Turner's 2009-10 season. Junior year. Entering the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season for the 2009–10 Michigan Wolverines, Harris was regarded by some as the most highly rated player in the Big Ten. E.g., the FOX Sports preseason All-American list included him on its second team. No other Big Ten player was listed above the third team. However, ESPN chose both Lucas and Turner to its preseason second-team All-American list, while Harris was not shown on a single ballot. Harris and Sims were named among the 50 preseason Wooden Award watch list nominees. Harris was also named to the preaseason Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist. The 24-member Big Ten media panel selected Harris as a first team preseason All-Big Ten team member. Harris opened the season by recording the second triple double in school history (Gary Grant was the first) against Division II Northern Michigan. This earned him his third Big Ten player of the week honor and marked the second consecutive season he earned the honor in the first week of the year. Harris was suspended prior to the January 23 game against #13 Purdue due to unsportsmanlike conduct in one of the team's practices. Harris was named as a finalist for the 2010 Bob Cousy Award and a Midseason Top-30 finalist for the 2010 John Wooden Award. At the conclusion of the regular season, he was named a third-team All-Big Ten selection by both the conference coaches and the media. He was recognized as an All-District second-team selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All‐America teams. Since the Big Ten Conference was its own district, this is equivalent to being named second team All-Big Ten by the NABC. Harris concluded his junior season with 484 free throws made. Cazzie Russell holds the official Michigan career record with 486 with Louis Bullock's 505 total having been vacated due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. He joined Jalen Rose and Mike McGee as the only Wolverines to amass 1600 points over a three-year period. Harris finished the season among the Big Ten Conference leaders in several statistical categories including: fourth in scoring, tenth in rebounds, fifth in assists, seventh in free throw percentage, second in steals (1.83 to 1.81), and eighth in minutes played. Harris told Coach John Beilein he would not be returning to the team for his senior season on March 26, 2010. He is soon to be hiring an agent. Although these were rumors reported by ""The Detroit News"", Harris held a press conference on March 29 to announce his intentions to enter the NBA Draft. ESPN has him ranked at 76. Draft Express, projects him as the 25th pick of the 2nd round. Another source has him listed as the 22nd pick of the 2nd round. Two days after the announcement, Harris was recognized as an Academic All-Conference performer again. Harris' name remained on the draft eligible list after the May 8 deadline for withdrawal. Harris endured a hamstring injury shortly before the draft, which hampered his draft workouts and draft potential. Harris was undrafted in the 2010 NBA draft on June 24, 2010. Professional career. 2010–2011. Harris played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Summer League in 2010. He saw limited action due to the same ankle injury that impaired his draft status. After being an undrafted player from Michigan for about 3 months, Harris joined the Cleveland Cavaliers with a #6 jersey number as a non-guaranteed free agent member of the 20-man preseason roster. The Cavaliers reduced their roster to 15 by October 19 without cutting Harris, which means that Harris made the final roster. On opening night of the 2010–11 NBA season for the Cavaliers, Harris was on the active twelve-man roster, but was not one of the nine players to see action in the October 27 game versus the Boston Celtics. However, in the subsequent October 29 game against the Toronto Raptors, Harris debuted with an eight-point performance that included two-for-two three point shooting. According to ESPN data, Harris' rookie salary is $473,604, which is the lowest on the roster. Harris' agent is Henry Thomas. Harris has been deep on the 15-man roster and in some games has not been one of the members of the 12-man active roster to dress for games. However, after compiling a 7–14 record in the first 21 games, head coach Byron Scott shuffled the lineup on December 8, and Harris played twenty-one minutes that night. In subsequent games, he saw significant action.  On December 29, Harris made his first start when Mo Williams was recovering from an injury and Harris earned the surprise start instead of Ramon Sessions. Harris started again on New Years Day 2011 alongside Sessions and posted his first double digit scoring night with eleven points and his first three-assist night. In his fourth start on January 7 against the Golden State, Harris posted his first double-double with career highs of 16 points and 10 rebounds and added 3 steals and 4 assists, too. Then, on January 9, he posted a new career-high 27 points against the Phoenix Suns. He finished January by scoring 20 points on back-to-back nights against the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat on January 30 and 31. He scored 19 in his next game against Indiana on February 2, but then with the return of Daniel Gibson and Anthony Parker to the lineup he saw little action until Gibson was unavailable against Houston on February 23 and Harris scored 21. 2011–2012. Harris was waived by the Cavaliers on December 22, 2011. The transaction came as the 2011–12 Cavaliers made their final cuts from 17 to 15 players. The move, which surprisingly left Mychel Thompson on the roster, was attributed to a freezer burn that Harris suffered on his foot during the 2011 NBA lockout in a cooling chamber designed to augment recuperation from injuries at the Nike facility in Oregon. Harris had been unable to practice with the team, but was expected to be claimed by another team. After clearing waivers on December 24, Harris became an unrestricted free agent. On December 28, 2011, Harris signed with the Canton Charge of the NBA Development League (D-League). The Charge are the D-League affiliate of the Cavaliers, but the Cavaliers have no exclusive rights to Harris. He was signed under the NBA Development League’s player affiliate rule allowing "". . .D-League teams to acquire up to three players that were waived from their affiliate’s NBA training camp that do not otherwise have their rights held by another team."" After about a week of rehab with the Charge, he was getting close to returning to the court with the Charge. Technically, he was waived by the team, but the Charge retained their rights to him during his rehab. On January 9, he was readded to the roster by the Charge, and he scored 15 points for the team on the 10th in his debut. On January 18 against the Austin Toros, he posted a game-high 24 points. He entered the starting lineup on January 20 against the Texas Legends and posted a team-high 17 points and added a game-high 19 points and 9 rebounds in a rematch the following night. On January 24, he contributed a game-high 32-point effort against the Springfield Armor, surpassing both his professional career-high of 27 set on January 9, 2011 with Cleveland and his post-secondary career-high 30 set on November 11, 2008 with Michigan. On January 27, he had his first D-league double-double with 22 points and 10 rebounds, in addition to a team-high 7 assists against the Bakersfield Jam. He continued his scoring binge on January 28 against the Los Angeles D-Fenders with a team-high 21 points. He earned the NBA Development League Performer of the Week for games played from January 23–29 for his three-game performance in which he averaged 25.0 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 2.0 steals in 34.3 minutes per contest. On February 3, Harris logged his professional career-high 14 rebounds along with 21 points on his way to his second D-League double-double against the Austin Toros. Harris posted his third double-double on February 11 against the Sioux Falls Skyforce with 24 points and 13 rebounds. On February 16, Harris posted a new career high 46 points along with 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 4 steals against the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. In the rematch two nights later, he added 36 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 steals. He became the first player to earn two player of the week awards in the 2011–12 season when the league recognized him for his performance for the week of February 13–19. On February 21, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced they had signed Harris to a 10-day contract. He was re-signed on March 2 to a second 10-day contract. After the second 10-day contract expired on March 11 and with the trade deadline approaching on March 15, the Cavaliers opted not to sign Harris to a guaranteed contract for the rest of the season (which would be required to resign him after two 10-day contracts). Rather than report to the D-League Canton Charge, Harris opted to remain a free agent while teams made roster moves. On March 17, 2012, the Cavaliers re-signed Harris for the remainder of the season. On March 21, Harris moved into the main rotation and began playing about 20 minutes or more per game. On March 25, against the Phoenix Suns, Harris posted a game-high 9 rebounds. On April 6 with Parker, Kyrie Irving and Gibson all injured, Harris made his first start of the season and 16th of his career against the Toronto Raptors. On April 20, Harris posted his first NBA double-double of the season with 19 points and a game-high and career-high 12 rebounds against the New York Knicks. 2012–2013. On July 2, 2012, the Cavaliers waived Harris. Harris then joined the Houston Rockets for the 2012 NBA Summer League. On September 13, 2012, Harris signed with BC Azovmash in Ukraine.  2013–2014. On September 27, 2013, Harris signed with the Orlando Magic for training camp. Personal. His name, Corperryale, is a combination of the names of his cousin (Corrine), an uncle (Perry) and the ""ale"" of his immediate siblings—Janelle, Jerrelle and Al. He has a total of nine brothers and sisters and is the son of Merrick (Harris-Carter) and James Carter. His nickname, ""Manny"", was given to him by his father after the character Manny Ribera in ""Scarface"". "
wikipedia-1095210," Boron carbide  Boron carbide (chemical formula approximately B4C) is an extremely hard boron–carbon ceramic material used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous industrial applications. With a Mohs hardness of about 9.497, it is one of the hardest materials known, behind cubic boron nitride and diamond.  Boron carbide was discovered in the 19th century as a by-product of reactions involving metal borides, however, its chemical formula was unknown. It was not until the 1930s that the chemical composition was estimated as B4C. There remained, however, controversy as to whether or not the material had this exact 4:1 stoichiometry, as in practice the material is always slightly carbon-deficient with regard to this formula, and X-ray crystallography shows that its structure is highly complex, with a mixture of C-B-C chains and B12 icosahedra. These features argued against a very simple exact B4C empirical formula. Because of the B12 structural unit, the chemical formula of ""ideal"" boron carbide is often written not as B4C, but as B12C3, and the carbon deficiency of boron carbide described in terms of a combination of the B12C3 and B12C2 units. The ability of boron carbide to absorb neutrons without forming long lived radionuclides makes it attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rod and shut down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area. Crystal structure. Boron carbide has a complex crystal structure typical of icosahedron-based borides. There, B12 icosahedra form a rhombohedral lattice unit (space group: ""Rm"" (No. 166), lattice constants: ""a"" = 0.56 nm and ""c"" = 1.212 nm) surrounding a C-B-C chain that resides at the center of the unit cell, and both carbon atoms bridge the neighboring three icosahedra. This structure is layered: the B12 icosahedra and bridging carbons form a network plane that spreads parallel to the ""c""-plane and stacks along the ""c""-axis. The lattice has two basic structure units – the B12 icosahedron and the B6 octahedron. Because of the small size of the B6 octahedra, they cannot interconnect. Instead, they bond to the B12 icosahedra in the neighboring layer, and this decreases bonding strength in the ""c""-plane.  Because of the B12 structural unit, the chemical formula of ""ideal"" boron carbide is often written not as B4C, but as B12C3, and the carbon deficiency of boron carbide described in terms of a combination of the B12C3 and B12C2 units. Some studies indicate the possibility of incorporation of one or more carbon atoms into the boron icosahedra, giving rise to formulas such as (B11C)CBC = B4C at the carbon-heavy end of the stoichiometry, but formulas such as B12(CBB) = B14C at the boron-rich end. A common intermediate, which approximates a commonly found ratio of elements, is B12(CBC) = B6.5C. Properties. Boron carbide is known as a robust material having high hardness, high cross section for absorption of neutrons (i.e. good shielding properties against neutrons), stability to ionizing radiation and most chemicals. Its Vickers hardness (38 GPa), Elastic Modulus (460 GPa) and fracture toughness (3.5 MPa·m1/2) approach the corresponding values for diamond (115 GPa and 5.3 MPa·m1/2). Preparation. Boron carbide was first synthesized by Henri Moissan in 1899, by reduction of boron trioxide either with carbon or magnesium in presence of carbon in an electric arc furnace. In the case of carbon, the reaction occurs at temperatures above the melting point of B4C and is accompanied by liberation of large amount of carbon monoxide:  If magnesium is used, the reaction can be carried out in a graphite furnace, and the magnesium byproducts are removed by treatment with acid.

wikipedia-455647," Anas  Anas is a genus of dabbling ducks. It includes mallards, wigeons, teals, pintails and shovelers in a number of subgenera. Some authorities prefer to elevate the subgenera to genus rank. Indeed, as the moa-nalos are very close to this clade and may have evolved later than some of these lineages, it is rather the absence of a thorough review than lack of necessity that this genus is rather over-lumped. However, there are 42 species verified by ITIS, and IUCN recognizes 46 species. Systematics. The phylogeny of this genus is one of the most confounded ones of all living birds. Research is hampered by the fact the radiation of the two major groups of ""Anas"" – the teals and mallard groups – took place in a very short time and fairly recently, roughly in the mid-late Pleistocene. Furthermore, hybridization may have long played a major role in ""Anas"" evolution, with within-subgenus hybrids regularly and between-subgenus hybrids not infrequently being fully fertile. The relationships between species are much obscured by this fact, and mtDNA sequence data is of dubious value in resolving their relationships; on the other hand, nuclear DNA sequences evolve too slowly to resolve the phylogeny of the subgenus ""Anas"" for example.  Some major clades can be discerned. For example, that the traditional subgenus ""Anas"", the mallard group, forms a monophyletic (in the loose sense, i.e. non-holophyletic) group has never been seriously questioned by modern science and is as good as confirmed (but see below). On the other hand, the phylogeny of the teals is very confusing. For these reasons, the dabbling duck lineages more distantly related to mallard group (which includes the type species of ""Anas"") than the wigeons should arguably be separated in their own genera. These would include the Baikal Teal, the Garganey, the spotted black-capped ""Punanetta"" group, and the shovelers and other blue-winged species. Whether the wigeons, which are very distinct in morphology and behavior, but much less so in mtDNA cytochrome ""b"" and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequences, should also be considered a distinct genus ""Mareca"" (including the Gadwall and Falcated Duck) is essentially the one remaining point of dispute as regards the question which taxa should remain in this genus and which ones should not. Species. The following arrangement is based on current morphological, molecular, and behavioral characters and presents apparent major evolutionary groupings compared to the subgenera the species were placed in at one time or another. Probable genus Sibirionetta – Baikal Teal Probable genus Querquedula – Garganey (may include ""Punanetta"") Probable genus Punanetta Probable genus Spatula – blue-winged ducks/shovelers and allies (polyphyletic?) Possible genus Mareca – wigeons (may include ""Chaulelasmus"" and ""Eunetta"") Subgenus Chaulelasmus – Gadwall Subgenus Eunetta – Falcated Duck Subgenus Dafila – pintails Subgenus Nettion – teals (paraphyletic) Subgenus Melananas – African Black Duck Subgenus Anas – mallard and relatives (may include ""Melananas"") Formerly placed in ""Anas"": Fossil record. A number of fossil species of ""Anas"" have been described. Their relationships are often undetermined: Several prehistoric waterfowl supposedly part of the ""Anas"" assemblage are nowadays not placed in this genus anymore, at least not with certainty: Highly problematic, albeit in a theoretical sense, is the placement of the moa-nalos. These are in may be derived from a common ancestor of the Pacific Black Duck, the Laysan Duck, and the Mallard, and an unknown amount of other lineages. Phylogenetically, they may even form a clade within the traditional genus ""Anas"". However, as opposed to these species – which are well representative of dabbling ducks in general – the moa-nalos are the most radical departure from the anseriform bauplan known to science. This illustrates that in a truly evolutionary sense, a strictly phylogenetic taxonomy may be difficult to apply. "

Baldoni was born in Los Angeles, California, and was raised in Medford, Oregon, the son of Sharon and Sam Baldoni. His mother is Jewish and his father is of Italian ancestry. Baldoni was raised in the Bahá'í Faith. Baldoni played soccer and ran track in high school, and was a radio disc jockey at a local top 40 radio station. Unfortunately, his hopes of playing professional sports were foiled when he tore his hamstring his senior year. Even with his injury, Baldoni was offered a place on the Long Beach State track team his freshman year at California State University. However, he was not able to fully rehabilitate his hamstring in time, and Baldoni left Long Beach for Los Angeles. While moving into a new apartment building, Baldoni met a manager who advised him to pursue a career in acting. In 2008, Baldoni wrote, produced, and directed his first music video that was selected and showcased at the Dawn Breakers International Film Festival. He shortly after directed a short film entitled ""The Walk to Fame"" for Warner Brothers artist Jason Derulo and various music videos for Brendan James and S-Curve artist Andy Grammer. Personal life. Justin Baldoni is a budding philanthropist, director, and actor that dedicates his time to service through his art. Raised in Oregon, his love for filmmaking was sparked by both visiting film sets with his dad, and a broken camera they gave him as a young boy.  A man of strong faith, Justin truly attempts to “walk the walk.” His hope is to inspire others to connect to the unifying effect of art and media and see it not just simply as entertainment, but as a vehicle to effect change. Justin’s acting credits include appearing as a series regular on the WB’s hit show “Everwood,” a recurring arc on NBC’s “Heroes,” and various other television movies, mini-series, and independent films.  As a director, Justin’s main goal is to inspire. He recently partnered with SoulPancake and Emmy-nominated actor Rainn Wilson to create a documentary series titled “My Last Days.” The show focuses on people who are terminally ill, but refuse to give up on life. Justin hopes the show will inspire people to stop taking the time we have left for granted, and begin to appreciate what truly matters. “You don’t have to find out you’re dying to start living.”-Zach Sobiech, 2012. With the commercial and music video production house Oil Factory in his corner, Justin has also filmed music videos for artists such as platinum-selling singer Jason Derulo and recent platinum-selling artist Andy Grammer, as well as videos for artists from Island Def Jam, Capitol, Warner Bro’s, and more. He’s also spent time shooting commercials (Sony, Missouri Lottery, etc.), and recently partnered with Grammy Award-winning artist Sarah McLachlan and the Union Rescue Mission of Los Angeles to create a public service announcement raising awareness about homelessness.  Baldoni is extremely active and is a huge sports fan. He is an avid runner and when not filming on location he plays in a competitive soccer league in Los Angeles. After landing the role on ""Everwood"", he moved from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City, Utah, where the show was filmed. Off screen, Baldoni leads a quiet life and has declared in interviews that, as a member of the Baha'i faith, he does not drink, does not smoke nor take drugs and believes ""waiting for marriage"" shouldn't be considered old-fashioned. In his own words, Justin believes that “the purpose of art is to elevate human consciousness…if we’re not doing good with it, then what are we really doing?” "

wikipedia-283974," Coot  Coots are medium-sized, crane-like birds that are members of the Rallidae (rail) family. They constitute the genus Fulica. Coots have predominantly black plumage, and—unlike many rails—they are usually easy to see, often swimming in open water. They are close relatives of the moorhen. Description. Coots have prominent frontal shields or other decoration on the forehead, with red to dark red eyes and coloured bills. Many, but not all, have white on the under tail. The featherless shield gave rise to the expression ""as bald as a coot,"" which the Oxford English Dictionary cites in use as early as 1430. Like other rails, they have long, lobed toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. Coots have strong legs and can walk and run vigorously. They tend to have short, rounded wings and are weak fliers, though northern species nevertheless can cover long distances. Distribution and habitat. The greatest species variety occurs in South America, and the genus likely originated there. They are common in Europe and North America. Coot species that migrate do so at night. The American Coot has been observed rarely in Britain and Ireland. Ecology and behavior. Coots are omnivorous, eating mainly plant material, but also small animals and eggs. They are aggressively territorial during the breeding season, but are otherwise often found in sizeable flocks on the shallow vegetated lakes they prefer. At least some coots have difficulty feeding a large family of hatchlings on the tiny shrimp and insects that they collect. So after about three days they start attacking their own chicks when they beg for food. After a short while, these attacks concentrate on the weaker chicks, who eventually give up begging and die. The coot may eventually raise only two or three out of nine hatchlings. A group of coots may be referred to as a ""covert"" or ""cover"". "
wikipedia-3989604," Cohabitation agreement  A cohabitation agreement is a form of legal agreement reached between a couple who have chosen to live together (whether they are heterosexual or homosexual). In some ways, such a couple may be treated like a married couple, such as when applying for a mortgage or working out child support. However, in some other areas, such as property rights, pensions and inheritance, they are treated differently. A cohabitation agreement contains documentation for a couple who want to live together in order to protect themselves from unnecessary cost and litigation should their cohabitation break down. They can clearly regulate their property rights and what arrangements might be made for mutual financial support, dealing with debt, caring for children, etc. The agreement also, much like a prenuptial agreement, allows the individuals concerned to determine in advance who will keep specific assets and what will happen to assets that have been purchased jointly if they separate. This agreement is intended to bind both parties. Advantages. A cohabitation contract helps clarify financial commitments. Working out who pays what and how responsibilities are shared in running the home need sorting out for a harmonious home life. It is a good idea in that if the couple does break up, an altercation about who receives what may be less likely. However, the courts may occasionally change or ignore provisions set out in a cohabitation agreement if they feel that they are inadequate under the circumstances. Disadvantages and limitations. There's no guarantee that a court will support the terms of a cohabitation contract in the United Kingdom. Thinking about and talking through all the issues that should be covered – including death, divorce, and illness, often involve long, hard work. But talking about the terms of a contract could be looked on as a massive plus to a relationship, showing that it is mature enough to work through major decisions. A cohabitation agreement will usually not be adequate to settle all legal issues that might arise, so a trust deed setting out property rights and a will are also recommended. Common law marriage. It is a common misconception that there is a doctrine of ""Common Law marriage"" in English law. That is to say that without having married, there is no automatic right to home ownership, even if the home is shared for a long time. Instead, the only way in which ownership can be obtained is through ordinary trust law. Interestingly, even if the parties are legally married, there is still no automatic right to home ownership. Instead, any transfer of ownership will be at the discretion of the court when exercising their power under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. In Canada, each province has legislation which governs the creation of cohabitation agreements. In the Province of Ontario there are restrictions on what can be included in such agreements. For example, clauses requiring chastity are unenforceable. Provisions which pre-determine issues of child custody and access as well as child support may be disregarded by a court Same sex couples. Some gay activists have been campaigning for legal recognition of their partnerships. Their campaigning for the right to take over a partner's tenancy of the family home on bereavement have been gained, regardless of any cohabitation agreement existing, but if a couple share a home their chances of buying the rights are much more limited. In December 2005, the British government offered gay couples equal rights with married couples if they register a civil partnership legally. The government-backed scheme – which enables same-sex couples to qualify for next-of-kin entitlements on inheritance tax, pensions and property – is likely to attract many more couples. There will still be large legal differences between civil partnership and marriage. For example, a couple can get married and have all the legal rights and benefits after knowing each other for only a few days, but a same-sex couple will almost certainly be required to show a lengthy commitment to each other before they are allowed to register their partnership. Currently, for immigration purposes, a same-sex couple must show they have a relationship of two years' standing, and it is likely that a similar term will be imposed for registering a partnership. Consequently, same-sex couples will need to make wills and a cohabitation agreement, to provide security in the event of break-up. Prenuptial agreements. As afore mentioned, the term is also sometimes used loosely to refer to prenuptial agreements. These are often designed when one intends to protect his or her wealth in the event of the marriage ending in divorce. The contract aims to achieve a measure of certainty about what the financial ""damage"" would be if the marriage came to an end. However ""K v K"" (2003) has heightened the importance of prenuptial agreements by deciding that the wife had to stick by the terms of a prenuptial agreement she signed. The courts still keep their discretion about whether or not a prenuptial agreement will be upheld but this new case shows that the courts are in favour of couples making private agreements between themselves.

wikipedia-329469," Ouachita River  The Ouachita River ( ) is a river that runs south and east through the U.S. states of Arkansas and Louisiana, joining the Tensas River to form the Black River near Jonesville, Louisiana. Course. The Ouachita River begins in the Ouachita Mountains near Mena, Arkansas. It flows east into Lake Ouachita, a reservoir created by Blakely Mountain Dam. The North Fork and South Fork of the Ouachita flow into Lake Ouachita to join the main stream. Portions of the river in this region flow through the Ouachita National Forest. From the lake, the Ouachita flows south into Lake Hamilton, a reservoir created by Carpenter Dam, named after Flavius Josephus Carpenter. The city of Hot Springs lies on the north side of Lake Hamilton. Another reservoir, Lake Catherine, impounds the Ouachita just below Lake Hamilton. Below Lake Catherine, the river flows free through most of the rest of Arkansas. Just below Lake Catherine, the river bends south near Malvern, and collects the Caddo River near Arkadelphia. Downstream, the Little Missouri River joins the Ouachita. After passing the city of Camden, shortly downstream from where dredging for navigational purposes begins, the river collects the waters of Smackover Creek and later the Ouachita's main tributary, the Saline River. South of the Saline, the Ouachita flows into Lake Jack Lee, a reservoir created by the Ouachita and Black River Project, just north of the Louisiana state line. The Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge encompasses the Ouachita from the Saline River to Lake Jack Lee's mouth. Below Lake Jack Lee, the Ouachita continues south into Louisiana. The river flows generally south through the state, collecting the tributary waters of Bayou Bartholomew, Bayou de Loutre, Bayou d'Arbonne, the Boeuf River, and the Tensas River. The river below the junction of the Tensas is called the Black River and flows for in Catahoula Parish and Concordia Parish until it joins the Red River, which flows into both the Atchafalaya River and the Mississippi River, via the Old River Control Structure. The Ouachita has five locks and dams along its length, located at Camden, Calion, and Felsenthal, Arkansas, and in Columbia and Jonesville, Louisiana. History. The river is named for the Ouachita tribe, one of several historic tribes who lived along it. Others included the Caddo, Osage Nation, Tensa, Chickasaw, and Choctaw. ""Washita"" is an Indian word meaning ""good hunting grounds"" and ""sparkling silver water.""  Before the rise of the historic tribes, their indigenous ancestors lived along the river for thousands of years. In the Lower Mississippi Valley, they began building monumental earthwork mounds in the Middle Archaic period (6000-2000 BCE in Louisiana). The earliest construction was Watson Brake, an 11-mound complex built about 3500 BCE by hunter gatherers in present-day Louisiana. The discovery and dating of several such early sites in northern Louisiana has changed the traditional model, which associated mound building with sedentary, agricultural societies, but these cultures did not develop for thousands of years.  The largest such prehistoric mound was destroyed in the 20th century during construction of a bridge at Jonesville, Louisiana. Likely built by the Mississippian culture, which rose about 1000 CE on the Mississippi and its tributaries, this mound was reported in use as late as 1540 by the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. On his expedition through this area, he encountered Indians' occupying the site. A lightning strike destroyed the temple on the mound that year, which was seen as a bad omen by the tribe. They never rebuilt the temple, and were recorded as abandoning the site in 1736. During the late 1700s, when the area was controlled by the Spanish and French, the river served as a route for early colonists, and for land speculators such as the self-styled Baron de Bastrop. The ""Bastrop lands"" later passed into the hands of another speculator, former Vice President Aaron Burr. He saw potential for big profits in the event of a war with Spain following the Louisiana Purchase. Burr and many of his associates were arrested for treason, before their band of armed settlers reached the Ouachita.  During the 1830s, the Ouachita River Valley attracted land speculators from New York and southeastern cities. Its rich soil and accessibility due to the country's elaborate river steamboat network made it desirable. Developers cultivated land for large cotton plantations; dependent on slave labor, cotton production supported new planter wealth in the ante-bellum years. Steamboats ran scheduled trips between Camden, Arkansas and New Orleans, for example. A person could travel from any eastern city to the Ouachita River without touching land, except to transfer from one steamboat to another.  One of the investors from the east was Meriwether Lewis Randolph, the youngest grandson of Thomas Jefferson. He was building a home on the Ouachita River in what is now Clark County, Arkansas, when he died of malaria in 1837. He had been appointed Secretary of the Arkansas Territory by President Andrew Jackson in 1835, and had relinquished his commission when Arkansas became a state in 1836. Skirmishes took place near the Ouachita River during the American Civil War. On September 1, 1863, forces of the Seventeenth Wisconsin led by Brig. Gen. M.M. Crocker crossed from Natchez, Mississippi to Vidalia, the seat of Concordia Parish, and moved toward the lower Ouachita in the section called the Black River. That night the Confederate steamer ""Rinaldo"" was captured by Union forces after a short artillery duel and was destroyed. Crocker fought with the few troops stationed on the Black River and moved toward Harrisonburg, seat of Catahoula Parish. Natural history. The river continues to be utilized for commercial navigation on a smaller scale than during its ""steamboat"" days. It is fed by numerous small creeks containing endemic native fish such as killifish. Fishing remains popular in the river for black bass, white bass, bream, freshwater drum, and gar. Concerns about airborne mercury contamination in some areas discourage consumption of the fish for food. Fishing for rainbow trout is popular in the tailwaters of Lakes Ouachita, Hamilton and Catherine in and around Hot Springs, Arkansas.  The river is commercially navigable from Camden, Arkansas, to its terminal point in Jonesville in Catahoula Parish in eastern Louisiana. Upstream of Camden, the river receives substantial recreational use.  The Ouachita is lined for most of its length with deep woods, including substantial wetlands. It has a scenic quality representative of the southwestern Arkansas and northern Louisiana region. Lists. Major towns along the river are: "
wikipedia-8846," Datura  Datura is a genus of nine species of vespertine flowering plants belonging to the family Solanaceae. They are known as angel's trumpets, sometimes sharing that name with the closely related genus ""Brugmansia"", and commonly as daturas. They are also sometimes called moonflowers, one of several plant species to be so. Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive cultivation and naturalization throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Its distribution within the Americas, however, is most likely restricted to the United States and Mexico, where the highest species diversity occurs.  Some South American plants formerly thought of as ""Datura"" are now treated as belonging to the distinct genus ""Brugmansia"" (""Brugmansia"" differs from ""Datura"" in that it is woody, making shrubs or small trees, and it has pendulous flowers, rather than erect ones). Other related genera include ""Hyoscyamus"" and ""Atropa"". Etymology. Datura  through Latin and Hindi: धतूरा dhatūra ""jimson weed"" ultimately from Sanskrit धत्तुरह dhattūrāh, a kind of flowering plant. ^ American Heritage Dictionary – Datura Description. ""Datura"" species are herbaceous, leafy annuals and short-lived perennials which can reach up to 2 m in height. The leaves are alternate, 10–20 cm long and 5–18 cm broad, with a lobed or toothed margin. The flowers are erect or spreading (not pendulous like those of ""Brugmansia""), trumpet-shaped, 5–20 cm long and 4–12 cm broad at the mouth; colors vary from white to yellow, pink, and pale purple. The fruit is a spiny capsule 4–10 cm long and 2–6 cm broad, splitting open when ripe to release the numerous seeds. The seeds disperse freely over pastures, fields and even wasteland locations.  ""Datura"" belongs to the classic ""witches' weeds"", along with deadly nightshade, henbane, and mandrake. Most parts of the plants contain toxic hallucinogens, and datura has a long history of use for causing delirious states and death. It was well known as an essential ingredient of love potions and witches' brews. The word ""datura"" comes from the sanskrit ""dhatūr"" (""thorn apple""); In Sanskrit it is referred as ""Kanak"" and ""Unmatt"" in the ancient scriptures of Indian Ayurveda by sage Sushrut and Charaka. Record of this name in English dates back to 1662. Nathaniel Hawthorne refers to one type in ""The Scarlet Letter"" as ""apple-Peru"". In Mexico, its common name is ""toloache"".  In India it has been referred and attributed to as ""Poisonous"" and aphrodisiac. In little measures it was used in Ayurveda as a medicine from the ancient times. It is used in rituals and prayers to Lord Shiva. The larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including ""Hypercompe indecisa"", eat some ""Datura"" species. Species and cultivars. It is difficult to classify ""Datura"" as to its species, and it often happens that the descriptions of new species are accepted prematurely. Later, these ""new species"" are found to be simply varieties that have evolved due to conditions at a specific location. They usually disappear in a few years. Contributing to the confusion is the fact that various species, such as ""D. wrightii"" and ""D. inoxia"", are very similar in appearance, and the variation within a species can be extreme. For example, ""Datura"" species can change size of plant, leaf, and flowers, all depending on location. The same species, when growing in a half-shady, damp location can develop into a flowering bush half as tall as a person, but when growing in a very dry location, will only grow into a thin plant not much more than ankle-high, with tiny flowers and a few miniature leaves. Today, experts classify only nine species of ""Datura"": American Brugmansia and Datura Society, Inc. (ABADS) is designated in the 2004 edition of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants as the official International Cultivar Registration Authority for ""Datura"". This role was delegated to ABADS by the International Society for Horticultural Science in 2002. Cultivation. ""Datura"" species are usually planted annually from the seed produced in the spiny pods, but with care, plants can be overwintered. Most species are suited to being planted outside or in containers. As a rule, they need warm, sunny places and soil that will keep their roots dry. When grown outdoors in good locations, the plants tend to reseed themselves and may become invasive. In containers, they should have porous, aerated potting soil with adequate drainage. The plants are susceptible to fungi in the root area, so organic enrichment such as compost and manure should be avoided. Toxicity. All ""Datura"" plants contain tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine, hyoscyamine, and atropine, primarily in their seeds and flowers. Because of the presence of these substances, ""Datura"" has been used for centuries in some cultures as a poison and as a hallucinogen. There can be a 5:1 toxin variation across plants, and a given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions. This variation makes ""Datura"" exceptionally hazardous as a drug. In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of ""Datura"" was critical to minimize harm. Many tragic incidents result from modern recreational users ingesting ""Datura"". For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media contained stories of adolescents and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting ""Datura"". There are also several reports in the medical literature of deaths from ""D. stramonium"" and ""D. ferox"" intoxication. Children are especially vulnerable to atropine poisoning, and their prognosis is likely to be fatal. In some parts of Europe and India, ""Datura"" has been a popular poison for suicide and murder. From 1950 to 1965, the State Chemical Laboratories in Agra, India, investigated 2,778 deaths caused by ingesting ""Datura."" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported accidental poisoning resulting in hospitalization for a family of six who inadvertently ingested ""Datura"" used as an ingredient in stew. In some places, it is prohibited to buy, sell, or cultivate ""Datura"" plants. Effects of ingestion. Due to the potent combination of anticholinergic substances it contains, ""Datura"" intoxication typically produces effects similar to that of an anticholinergic delirium (as contrasted to hallucination): a complete inability to differentiate reality from fantasy; hyperthermia; tachycardia; bizarre, and possibly violent behavior; and severe mydriasis with resultant painful photophobia that can last several days. Pronounced amnesia is another commonly reported effect.  No other psychoactive substance has received as many severely negative recreational experience reports as has ""Datura"". The overwhelming majority of those who describe their use of ""Datura"" find their experiences extremely unpleasant both mentally and physically and often physically dangerous. Treatment. Due to their agitated behavior and confused mental state, victims of ""Datura"" poisoning are typically hospitalized. Stomach pumping and the administration of activated charcoal can be used to reduce the stomach's absorption of the ingested material. The drug physostigmine is used to reverse the effect of the poisons. Benzodiazepines can be given to curb the patient's agitation, and supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and symptomatic treatment is often provided. Observation of the patient is indicated until the symptoms resolve, usually from 24–36 hours after ingestion of the ""Datura"". "

Mok was educated in Ping Yi Secondary School and Yishun Junior College. Mok made her debut in the 1990s comedy show ""Comedy Nite"". She was a cast member from 1996, until the demise of the show. Her roles in the skits helped her to land a contract with MediaCorp in 2006. She bagged the Best Supporting Actress Award in the Star Awards 2003 for playing a dowdy and meek wife in ""Holland V"", and earned two nominations in the Asian Television Awards in 2006 and 2008. Mok was switched to hosting MediaCorp events and shows in 2010. In a 2012 interview, she confessed that she felt uncomfortable being an emcee and thought she was better suited to acting in dramas and sitcoms.

wikipedia-220872," Grito de Dolores  The Grito de Dolores (""Cry of Dolores""), was uttered from the small town of Dolores, near Guanajuato, on September 16, 1810. It is the event that marks the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. The ""grito"" was the ""pronunciamiento"" of the Mexican War of Independence by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Roman Catholic priest. Since October 1825, the anniversary of the event is celebrated as Mexican Independence Day. The event. Hidalgo and several criollos were involved in a planned revolt against the Spanish colonial government, when several plotters were killed. Fearing his arrest, Hidalgo commanded his brother Mauricio, as well as Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release the pro-independence inmates there on the night of 15 April. They managed to set eighty free. Around 6:00 am on September 16, 1810, Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation. Flanked by Allende and Juan Aldama, he addressed the people in front of his church, encouraging them to revolt. The Siege of Guanajuato, the first major engagement of the insurgency, occurred 4 days later. Mexico's independence would not be effectively declared from Spain in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire until September 28, 1821, after a decade of war. Wording. This is celebrated on September 16, 1810. There is no scholarly consensus as to what exactly Hidalgo said at the time, as the book ""The Course of Mexican History"" states ""The exact words of this most famous of all Mexican speeches are not known, or, rather, they are reproduced in almost as many variations as there are historians to reproduce them"".  The book goes on to claim that ""the essential spirit of the message is... 'My children: a new dispensation comes to us today. Will you receive it? Will you free yourselves? Will you recover the lands stolen three hundred years ago from your forefathers by the hated Spaniards? We must act at once... Will you defend your religion and your rights as true patriots? Long live Our Lady of Guadalupe! Death to bad government! Death to the gachupines!'"" By contrast, William F. Cloud divides the sentiments above between both Hidalgo and the crowd... ""He told them that the time for action on their part had now come. When he asked, 'Will you be slaves of Napoleon or will you as patriots defend your religion, your hearths and your rights?' there was a unanimous cry, 'We will defend to the utmost! Long live religion, long live our most holy mother of Guadalupe! Long live America! Death to bad government, and death to the Gachupines!'"" Hidalgo’s Grito did not condemn the notion of monarchy or criticize the current social order in detail, but his opposition to the events in Spain and the current viceregal government was clearly expressed in his reference to bad government. The Grito also emphasized loyalty to the Catholic religion, a sentiment with which both Creoles and Peninsulares (native Spaniards) could sympathize; however, the strong anti-Spanish cry of “Death to the Gachupines” (Gachupines was a nickname given to Peninsulares) probably had caused horror among Mexico’s elite. Remembrance. This event has since assumed an almost mythic status. Since the late 20th century, Hidalgo y Costilla’s ""cry of independence"" has become emblematic of Mexican independence. Each year on the night of September 15 at around eleven in the evening, the President of Mexico rings the bell of the National Palace in Mexico City. After the ringing of the bell, he repeats a cry of patriotism (a Grito Mexicano) based upon the ""Grito de Dolores"", with the names of the important heroes of the Mexican War of Independence who were there on that very historical moment included, and ending with the threefold shout of ""¡Viva México!"" from the balcony of the palace to the assembled crowd in the Plaza de la Constitución, or Zócalo, one of the largest public plazas in the world. After the shouting, he rings the bell again and waves the Flag of Mexico to the applause of the crowd, and is followed by the playing and mass singing of the Himno Nacional Mexicano, the national anthem, with a military band from the Mexican Armed Forces playing. This event draws up to half a million spectators from all over Mexico and tourists worldwide. On the morning of September 16, or Independence Day, the national military parade (the September 16 military parade) in honor of the holiday starts in the Zócalo and its outskirts, passes the Hidalgo Memorial and ends on the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City’s main boulevard, passing the El Ángel memorial column and other places along the way. A similar celebration occurs in cities and towns all over Mexico, and in Mexican embassies and consulates worldwide on the 15th or the 16th. The mayor (or governor, in the case of state capitals and ambassadors or consuls in the case of overseas celebrations), rings a bell and gives the traditional words, with the names of Mexican independence heroes included, ending with the threefold shout of ""Viva Mexico!"", the bell ringing for the second time, the waving of the Mexican flag and the mass singing of the National Anthem by everyone in attendance. There are also celebrations in schools as well all over the country. In the 19th century, it became common practice for Mexican presidents in their final year in office to re-enact the Grito in Dolores Hidalgo, rather than in the National Palace. President Calderón officiated at the Grito in Dolores Hidalgo as part of the bicentennial celebrations in 2010 on the 16th of September, even though he had to do this first, to launch the national bicentennial celebrations, in the National Palace balcony on the night of the 15th. As a result, the 2012 commemoration, his last as President, was held in the National Palace balcony instead, thus becoming the third President breaking the traditional practice. The following day, September 16 is Independence Day in Mexico and is considered a patriotic holiday, or fiesta patria (literally, ""Patriot Festival"" or ""Civic Festival""). This day is marked by parades, patriotic programs, drum and bugle and marching band competitions, and special programs on the national and local media outlets, even concerts. Full version of the Cry of Dolores today. This is the version often recited by the President of Mexico in the national commemorative activity in the National Palace or at the church in Dolores Hidalgo. Local leaders can adapt this to their respective circumstances from the state to the municipal or city level. "
wikipedia-899781," Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs  Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs is a basketball video game developed and released by Electronic Arts. It was first released in 1989 for MS-DOS-compatible PCs and for the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis in 1991. The game was highly successful; it was the first game endorsed by the NBA and was the first to contain multiple NBA stars and teams in one game. The game's title alludes to the 1980s rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers. It is the first game in the NBA Playoffs series of games. The game would be the first team basketball video game to acquire full players names and rights without actually relying on the NBA Players Association. Established stars in the game include Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (DOS version only), Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and Patrick Ewing. The game introduced innovations in presentation. It was the first NBA game to feature TV style starting line up prior to the opening tip. It also introduced halftime shows and announcers to simulate an authentic feel. Later games would go further by replacing music during gameplay with audience cheers. Gameplay. The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, ""Exhibition"" or ""Playoffs"". There are also three difficulty levels: Pre-season, Regular season, Playoffs and Showtime. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters. Signature moves for individual star players have their own were introduced, such as Charles Barkley's gorilla dunk. Teams. Players can pick from one of eight teams who were among the 16 that had competed in the playoffs the year before the game was released. The MS-DOS version contained teams from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, while the Sega Genesis version contained the playoff teams from the 1990 NBA Playoffs.

wikipedia-36888727," VoIP gateway  A VoIP gateway is a gateway device that uses Internet Protocols to transmit and receive voice communications (VoIP). The general term is ambiguous and can mean many different things. There are many such devices. They are quickly becoming the most common type of voice phone service in many areas. Setup. A typical VoIP gateway has interfaces to both IP networks and Public switched telephone network (PSTN) or POTS (Plain old telephone service) telephone services. The gateway may be configured to use these in several ways, including: The PSTN interface is often either duplicated as, or can act as, connections for both a foreign exchange station (FXS) and a foreign exchange office (FXO). An FXS interface connects to FXO devices, such as local analogue telephone handsets or the exchange side of a PABX. The FXO interface connects to FXS devices, such as the PSTN. A relatively potent device is needed to use better compression formats, such as G.729a; a relatively inexpensive and simple device can easily handle a similar function using more bandwidth over G.711. Any device capable of delivering audio in G.711 via Internet in either way can be considered a VOIP Gateway, but one that is capable of sending and receiving simultaneously will perform better. One with support for more codecs will usually be able to perform better in a range of situations, such as restricted bandwidth, though doing so is not always easy to differentiate. The packets of data are quickly sent (as little as a few milliseconds between packets), most often using UDP. A lost packet or two will not usually result in any noticeable degradation of the signal. Using G.711 as the codec, it is possible to use a fax machine or modem via these devices without issues. This is mostly due to G.711 being a relatively simple compression audio stream. Other codecs will not usually perform this task. Any modern PC with a microphone and speakers (or a headset serving both those tasks) is capable of acting as a VoIP gateway. This still requires an Internet connection and a SIP relay. Most SIP relays are commercial and charge either pay-per-minute or a flat rate for unlimited service on a number of channels. "

wikipedia-113565," John Constable  John Constable (; 11 June 1776 – 31 March 1837) was an English Romantic painter. Born in Suffolk, he is known principally for his landscape paintings of Dedham Vale, the area surrounding his home—now known as ""Constable Country""—which he invested with an intensity of affection. ""I should paint my own places best"", he wrote to his friend John Fisher in 1821, ""painting is but another word for feeling"". His most famous paintings include ""Dedham Vale"" of 1802 and ""The Hay Wain"" of 1821. Although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in British art, Constable was never financially successful. He did not become a member of the establishment until he was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 52. His painting was embraced in France, where he sold more works than in his native England and inspired the Barbizon school. Early career. John Constable was born in East Bergholt, a village on the River Stour in Suffolk, to Golding and Ann (Watts) Constable. His father was a wealthy corn merchant, owner of Flatford Mill in East Bergholt and, later, Dedham Mill in Essex. Golding Constable owned a small ship, ""The Telegraph"", which he moored at Mistley on the Stour estuary, and used to transport corn to London. He was a cousin of the London tea merchant, Abram Newman. Although Constable was his parents' second son, his older brother was mentally handicapped and John was expected to succeed his father in the business. After a brief period at a boarding school in Lavenham, he was enrolled in a day school in Dedham. Constable worked in the corn business after leaving school, but his younger brother Abram eventually took over the running of the mills. In his youth, Constable embarked on amateur sketching trips in the surrounding Suffolk and Essex countryside, which was to become the subject of a large proportion of his art. These scenes, in his own words, ""made me a painter, and I am grateful""; ""the sound of water escaping from mill dams etc., willows, old rotten planks, slimy posts, and brickwork, I love such things."" He was introduced to George Beaumont, a collector, who showed him his prized ""Hagar and the Angel"" by Claude Lorrain, which inspired Constable. Later, while visiting relatives in Middlesex, he was introduced to the professional artist John Thomas Smith, who advised him on painting but also urged him to remain in his father's business rather than take up art professionally. In 1799, Constable persuaded his father to let him pursue a career in art, and Golding granted him a small allowance. Entering the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer, he attended life classes and anatomical dissections, and studied and copied old masters. Among works that particularly inspired him during this period were paintings by Thomas Gainsborough, Claude Lorrain, Peter Paul Rubens, Annibale Carracci and Jacob van Ruisdael. He also read widely among poetry and sermons, and later proved a notably articulate artist. By 1803, he was exhibiting paintings at the Royal Academy. In 1802 he refused the position of drawing master at Great Marlow Military College, a move which Benjamin West (then master of the RA) counselled would mean the end of his career. In that year, Constable wrote a letter to John Dunthorne in which he spelled out his determination to become a professional landscape painter: His early style has many qualities associated with his mature work, including a freshness of light, colour and touch, and reveals the compositional influence of the old masters he had studied, notably of Claude Lorrain. Constable's usual subjects, scenes of ordinary daily life, were unfashionable in an age that looked for more romantic visions of wild landscapes and ruins. He made occasional trips further afield. In 1803 he spent almost a month aboard the East Indiaman ship ""Coutts"" as it visited south-east ports, and in 1806 he undertook a two-month tour of the Lake District. He told his friend and biographer, Charles Leslie, that the solitude of the mountains oppressed his spirits, and Leslie wrote:  To make ends meet, Constable took up portraiture, which he found dull, though he executed many fine portraits. He also painted occasional religious pictures but, according to John Walker, ""Constable's incapacity as a religious painter cannot be overstated."" Constable adopted a routine of spending winter in London and painting at East Bergholt in summer. In 1811 he first visited John Fisher and his family in Salisbury, a city whose cathedral and surrounding landscape were to inspire some of his greatest paintings. Marriage and maturity. From 1809, his childhood friendship with Maria Bicknell developed into a deep, mutual love. Their marriage in 1816 when Constable was 40 was opposed by Maria's grandfather, Dr Rhudde, rector of East Bergholt. He considered the Constables his social inferiors and threatened Maria with disinheritance. Maria's father, Charles Bicknell, a solicitor, was reluctant to see Maria throw away her inheritance. Maria pointed out to John that a penniless marriage would detract from any chances he had of making a career in painting. Golding and Ann Constable, while approving the match, held out no prospect of supporting the marriage until Constable was financially secure. After they died in quick succession, Constable inherited a fifth share in the family business. John and Maria's marriage in October 1816 at St Martin-in-the-Fields (with Fisher officiating) was followed by time at Fisher's vicarage and a honeymoon tour of the south coast. The sea at Weymouth and Brighton stimulated Constable to develop new techniques of brilliant colour and vivacious brushwork. At the same time, a greater emotional range began to be expressed in his art. Although he had scraped an income from painting, it was not until 1819 that Constable sold his first important canvas, ""The White Horse"", which led to a series of ""six footers"", as he called his large-scale paintings. That year he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy. In 1821 he showed ""The Hay Wain"" (a view from Flatford Mill) at the Academy's exhibition. Théodore Géricault saw it on a visit to London and praised Constable in Paris, where a dealer, John Arrowsmith, bought four paintings, including ""The Hay Wain."" It was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1824, winning a gold medal. Of Constable's colour, Delacroix wrote in his journal: ""What he says here about the green of his meadows can be applied to every tone"". Delacroix repainted the background of his 1824 ""Massacre de Scio"" after seeing the Constables at Arrowsmith's Gallery, which he said had done him a great deal of good. In his lifetime, Constable sold only 20 paintings in England, but in France he sold more than 20 in just a few years. Despite this, he refused all invitations to travel internationally to promote his work, writing to Francis Darby: ""I would rather be a poor man England than a rich man abroad."" In 1825, perhaps due partly to the worry of his wife's ill-health, the uncongeniality of living in Brighton (""Piccadilly by the Seaside""), and the pressure of numerous outstanding commissions, he quarrelled with Arrowsmith and lost his French outlet. After the birth of their seventh child in January 1828, Maria fell ill and died of tuberculosis on 23 November. at the age of 41. Intensely saddened, Constable wrote to his brother Golding, ""hourly do I feel the loss of my departed Angel—God only knows how my children will be brought up...the face of the World is totally changed to me"". Thereafter, he dressed in black and was, according to Leslie, ""a prey to melancholy and anxious thoughts"". He cared for his seven children alone for the rest of his life. Shortly before Maria died, her father had also passed away, leaving her £20,000. Constable speculated disastrously with the money, paying for the engraving of several mezzotints of some of his landscapes in preparation for a publication. He was hesitant and indecisive, nearly fell out with his engraver, and when the folios were published, could not interest enough subscribers. Constable collaborated closely with the talented mezzotinter David Lucas on 40 prints after his landscapes, one of which went through 13 proof stages, corrected by Constable in pencil and paint. Constable said, ""Lucas showed me to the public without my faults"", but the venture was not a financial success. He was elected to the Royal Academy in February 1829, at the age of 52. In 1831 he was appointed Visitor at the Royal Academy, where he seems to have been popular with the students. He began to deliver public lectures on the history of landscape painting, which were attended by distinguished audiences. In a series of lectures at the Royal Institution, Constable proposed a three-fold thesis: firstly, landscape painting is scientific as well as poetic; secondly, the imagination cannot alone produce art to bear comparison with reality; and thirdly, no great painter was ever self-taught. He also spoke against the new Gothic Revival movement, which he considered mere ""imitation"". In 1835, his last lecture to students of the Royal Academy, in which he praised Raphael and called the Academy the ""cradle of British art"", was ""cheered most heartily"". He died on the night of the 31 March, apparently from heart failure, and was buried with Maria in the graveyard of St John-at-Hampstead, Hampstead. (His children John Charles Constable and Charles Golding Constable are also buried in this family tomb.) Art. Constable quietly rebelled against the artistic culture that taught artists to use their imagination to compose their pictures rather than nature itself. He told Leslie, ""When I sit down to make a sketch from nature, the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picture"". Although Constable produced paintings throughout his life for the ""finished"" picture market of patrons and R.A. exhibitions, constant refreshment in the form of on-the-spot studies was essential to his working method. He was never satisfied with following a formula. ""The world is wide"", he wrote, ""no two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of all the world; and the genuine productions of art, like those of nature, are all distinct from each other."" Constable painted many full-scale preliminary sketches of his landscapes to test the composition in advance of finished pictures. These large sketches, with their free and vigorous brushwork, were revolutionary at the time, and they continue to interest artists, scholars and the general public. The oil sketches of ""The Leaping Horse"" and ""The Hay Wain"", for example, convey a vigour and expressiveness missing from Constable's finished paintings of the same subjects. Possibly more than any other aspect of Constable's work, the oil sketches reveal him in retrospect to have been an ""avant-garde"" painter, one who demonstrated that landscape painting could be taken in a totally new direction. Constable's watercolours were also remarkably free for their time: the almost mystical ""Stonehenge"", 1835, with its double rainbow, is often considered to be one of the greatest watercolours ever painted. When he exhibited it in 1836, Constable appended a text to the title: ""The mysterious monument of Stonehenge, standing remote on a bare and boundless heath, as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present, carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown period."" In addition to the full-scale oil sketches, Constable completed numerous observational studies of landscapes and clouds, determined to become more scientific in his recording of atmospheric conditions. The power of his physical effects was sometimes apparent even in the full-scale paintings which he exhibited in London; ""The Chain Pier"", 1827, for example, prompted a critic to write: ""the atmosphere possesses a characteristic humidity about it, that almost imparts the wish for an umbrella"". The sketches themselves were the first ever done in oils directly from the subject in the open air. To convey the effects of light and movement, Constable used broken brushstrokes, often in small touches, which he scumbled over lighter passages, creating an impression of sparkling light enveloping the entire landscape. One of the most expressionistic and powerful of all his studies is ""Seascape Study with Rain Cloud"", painted about 1824 at Brighton, which captures with slashing dark brushstrokes the immediacy of an exploding cumulus shower at sea. Constable also became interested in painting rainbow effects, for example in ""Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows"", 1831, and in ""Cottage at East Bergholt"", 1833. To the sky studies he added notes, often on the back of the sketches, of the prevailing weather conditions, direction of light, and time of day, believing that the sky was ""the key note, the standard of scale, and the chief organ of sentiment"" in a landscape painting. In this habit he is known to have been influenced by the pioneering work of the meteorologist Luke Howard on the classification of clouds; Constable's annotations of his own copy of ""Researches About Atmospheric Phaenomena"" by Thomas Forster show him to have been fully abreast of meteorological terminology. ""I have done a good deal of skying"", Constable wrote to Fisher on 23 October 1821; ""I am determined to conquer all difficulties, and that most arduous one among the rest"". Constable once wrote in a letter to Leslie, ""My limited and abstracted art is to be found under every hedge, and in every lane, and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up"". He could never have imagined how influential his honest techniques would turn out to be. Constable's art inspired not only contemporaries like Géricault and Delacroix, but the Barbizon School, and the French impressionists of the late nineteenth century. Selected paintings.

wikipedia-1223159," Velouté sauce  A velouté sauce, pronounced , along with tomato, Hollandaise, Béchamel and espagnole, is one of the sauces of French cuisine that were designated the five ""mother sauces"" by Auguste Escoffier in the 19th century, which was a simplification of the ""Sauce Carême"" list of Marie-Antoine Carême. The term ""velouté"" is from the French adjectival form of ""velour"", meaning velvet. In preparing a velouté sauce, a light stock (one in which the bones used have not been previously roasted), such as chicken or fish stock, is thickened with a blond roux. Thus the ingredients of a velouté are equal parts by mass butter and flour to form the roux, a light chicken or fish stock, and salt and pepper for seasoning. The sauce produced is commonly referred to by the type of stock used e.g. chicken velouté. Derived sauces. ""Sauce velouté"" is often served on poultry or seafood dishes, and is used as the base for other sauces. Sauces derived from a velouté sauce include: "
wikipedia-977752," Amniotic fluid  Amniotic fluid or liquor amnii is the protective liquid contained by the amniotic sac of a pregnant female. Development of amniotic fluid. From the very beginning of the formation of the extracoelomal cavity, amniotic fluid can be detected. This firstly water-like fluid originates from the maternal plasma, and passes through the fetal membranes by osmotic and hydrostatic forces. As the placental and fetal vessels develop, the fluid passes through the fetal tissue, as the exsudatum of the skin. After the 20th-25th week of pregnancy when the keratinization of skin occurs, the quantity of amniotic fluid begins to depend on the factors that comprise the circulation of AF.  At first it is mainly water with electrolytes, but by about the 12-14th week the liquid also contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and phospholipids, and urea, all of which aid in the growth of the fetus.  The volume of amniotic fluid is positively correlated with the growth of fetus. From the 10th to the 20th week it increases from 25ml to 400ml approximately. From the 8th week, when the fetal kidneys begin to function, fetal urine is also present in the AF. Approximately in the 10th week the breathing and swallowing of the fetus slightly decrease the amount of AF, but neither urination nor swallowing contributes significantly to AF quantity changes, until the 25 week, when keratinization of skin is complete. Then the relationship between AF and fetal growth stops. It reaches the plateau of 800ml at the 28 week (gestational age). The amount of fluid declines to roughly 400 ml at 42 weeks ga. The forewaters are released when the amnion ruptures. This is commonly known as the time when a woman's ""water breaks"". When this occurs during labour at term, it is known as ""spontaneous rupture of membranes"" (SROM). If the rupture precedes labour at term, however, it is referred to as ""premature rupture of membranes"" (PROM). The majority of the hindwaters remain inside the womb until the baby is born. Artificial rupture of membrane (ARM), a manual rupture of the amniotic sac, can also be performed to release the fluid if the amnion has not spontaneously ruptured. Functions of amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid is ""inhaled"" and ""exhaled"" by the fetus. It is essential that fluid be breathed into the lungs in order for them to develop normally. Swallowed amniotic fluid also creates urine and contributes to the formation of meconium. Amniotic fluid protects the developing baby by cushioning against blows to the mother's abdomen, allowing for easier fetal movement and promoting muscular/skeletal development. Analysis. Analysis of amniotic fluid, drawn out of the mother's abdomen in an amniocentesis procedure, can reveal many aspects of the baby's genetic health. This is because the fluid also contains fetal cells, which can be examined for genetic defects. Amniotic fluid normally has a pH of 7.0 to 7.5. Because pH in the upper vagina is normally acidic (pH 3.8-4.5), a vaginal pH test showing a pH of more than 4.5 strengthens a suspicion of rupture of membranes in case of clear vaginal discharge in pregnancy. Other tests for detecting amniotic fluid mainly include nitrazine paper test and fern test. Amniotic fluid and stem cells. Recent studies show that amniotic fluid contains a considerable quantity of stem cells. Some researchers have found that amniotic fluid is also a plentiful source of non-embryonic stem cells. These cells have demonstrated the ability to differentiate into a number of different cell-types, including brain, liver and bone. It is possible to conserve the stem cells extracted from amniotic fluid in private stem cells banks. Some private companies offer this service for a fee. Complications related to amniotic fluid. Too little amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) can be a cause or an indicator of problems for the mother and baby. The majority of pregnancies proceed normally and the baby is born healthy, but this isn't always the case. Babies with too little amniotic fluid can develop contractures of the limbs, clubbing of the feet and hands, and also develop a life threatening condition called hypoplastic lungs. If a baby is born with hypoplastic lungs, which are small underdeveloped lungs, this condition is potentially fatal and the baby can die shortly after birth due to inadequate oxygenation. Potter sequence refers to a constellation of findings related to insufficient amniotic fluid and includes shortened and malformed limbs with clubbed feet and the underdeveloped lungs that can lead to perinatal death. On every prenatal visit, the obstetrician/gynaecologist or midwife should measure the patient's fundal height with a tape measure. It is important that the fundal height be measured and properly recorded to track proper fetal growth and the increasing development of amniotic fluid. The obstetrician/gynaecologist should also routinely ultrasound the patient—this procedure will also give an indication of proper fetal growth and amniotic fluid development. Oligohydramnios can be caused by infection, kidney dysfunction or malformation (since much of the late amniotic fluid volume is urine), procedures such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS), and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Oligohydramnios can sometimes be treated with bed rest, oral and intravenous hydration, antibiotics, steroids, and amnioinfusion. It is also important to keep the baby warm and moist. The opposite of oligohydramnios is polyhydramnios, an excess volume of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac. "
wikipedia-1208891," Bellary  Bellary (pronounced ) is a historic city in Bellary District in Karnataka state, India. Etymology. There are several legends explaining how Bellary got its name. The first is that a few devout traveling merchants halting in Bellar, could not find a Shiva Linga for their worship. They then installed a ""balla"" (a measuring cup or ""seru"" used to measure grain) upside down as a Shiva Linga and worshiped it. Eventually, that place was turned into a temple dedicated to ""Balleshwara"" or Shiva, which became distorted to ""Malleshwara""', and thus Bellary derives its name from this temple. The second legend is that the city is named after Indra, the king of Gods, who slew a Rakshasa (demon) named ""Balla"" who lived nearby. ""Balla-ari"" means 'enemy of Balla' (ari – enemy in Sanskrit). The third legend derives the city's name from the old Kannada word ""Vallari"" and ""Vallapuri"". This temple can still be found in the fort area of the city, and an annual festival and fair dedicated to Shiva is conducted at the temple premises even today. History. Numerous neolithic archeological sites have been discovered around Bellary, such as the ash mounds at Sanganakallu, Budhihal, Kudithini, Tekkalakote, Hiregudda and Kupgal. The Sanganakallu settlement, spread over an area of , is one of the largest neolithic complexes known around Bellary. Some of the events in the Ramayana have been related to places around Hampi, the celebrated capital of the Vijayanagara empire. Historically, the Bellary area has been known by many names, such as ""Kuntala Desha"", ""Sindavadi-nadu"" and ""Nolambavadi-nadu"". Bellary was ruled in succession by the Mauryas, the Satavahanas, the Pallavas, the Kadambas, the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Kalyani Chalukyas, the Southern Kalachuryas, the Sevuna Yadavas, and the Hoysalas, and also ruled briefly by the Cholas during the wars between Kalyani Chalukyas and the Cholas. After the Sevuna Yadavas and the Hoysalas were defeated by the Islamic sultanates of Delhi, the Vijayanagara Empire arose under Harihara I and Bukka I, who dominated the Bellary area. Bellary itself was ruled by the family of Hande Hanumappa Nayaka, a Palayagara of the Vijayanagara rulers. After the fall of the Vijayanagara empire, the Hande Nayakas of Bellary were successively subsidiary to the Adilshahi sultanate, the Mughals, the Nizam, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, and finally the British Empire after the Nizam ceded a large part of the southern Deccan to the British East India Company. The Hande Nayakas ceased to be rulers of Bellary after Major Thomas Munro disposed of the palayagars of the ceded districts and established the Ryotwari land revenue system. In 1808 AD, the ceded districts were split into the Bellary and Kadapa districts, and in 1867 AD the Bellary Municipal Council was created. Further, in 1882 AD, Anantapuram district was carved out of the Bellary District. The Maratha princely state of Sandur was surrounded by Bellary district. As of 1901 AD, Bellary was the seventh largest town in Madras Presidency, and one of the chief military stations in southern India, garrisoned by British and native Indian troops under the British Indian Government. The town included a civil railway station to the east of the Bellary Fort, the cantonment and its railway station on the west, the Cowl Bazaar and the suburbs of 'Bruce-pettah' (currently spelt Brucepet) and 'Mellor-pettah', named after two British officers once stationed in the town. The industries in the town included a small distillery and two steam cotton presses. The steam cotton-spinning mill established in 1894 had 17,800 spindles and employed 520 hands. On 1 October 1953 AD, the Bellary district of Madras State was divided on a linguistic basis. Areas with a significant Kannada speaking population were transferred to Mysore state, which later became Karnataka state. Areas of the district with a significant Telugu speaking population were merged into the Anantapuram and Karnulu districts in what would later become Andhra Pradesh state. Bellary city itself, with large numbers of both Kannada and Telugu speakers, was included into Mysore state after protracted debate and controversy. The Bellary city municipal council was upgraded to a city corporation in 2004. Bellary's population was 409,644 according to the 2011 census. Geography and Climate. Bellary has a semi arid climate,it is located at . It has an average elevation of 495 meters (1459 ft). The city stands in the midst of a wide, level plain of black cotton soil. As the city lies in the rain shadow region of the Western Ghats, it receives little rain from the southwest monsoon. Temperatures remain high from the months of March to mid June, with highest temperature recorded at 44.9 °C (110 °F). The months from July to October are relatively mild,and the months from November to February are moderately cold with average mean temperatures of around 22 °C (71 °F). The city receives about 24 inches (610 mm) of rain every year, mainly in the months from August to October,but can receive upto 36 inches of rain sometimes. City features. The rocks. Granite rocks and hills form a prominent feature of Bellary, and so granite quarrying is big business. The city is spread mainly around two huge rocky granite hills, the ""Ballari Gudda"" () and the ""Kumbara Gudda"" ()(""Gudda"" means hill in Kannada). These two hills are dominant features of the city and visible from every part of the city. Bellary fort. Bellary Fort () is located on top of Ballari Gudda (""Fort Hill""). The fort was built around the hill during Vijayanagara times by Hande Hanumappa Nayaka. Hyder Ali, who took possession of the fort from the Hande Nayaka family in 1769, renovating and modifying it with the help of a French engineer. The lower fort was added by Hyder Ali around the eastern half of the hill. Legend has it that the unfortunate French engineer was hanged for overlooking the fact that the neighbouring Kumbara Gudda is taller than Ballari Gudda, thus compromising the secrecy and command of the fort. His grave is believed to be located near the east gate of the fort, though some locals believe it to be the grave of a Muslim holy man instead. The fort was ranked as ""1st class"" by the British Administration. This fort gave Bellary its ancient importance, and led to its selection by the British rulers as the site for a cantonment. The fort is divided into the Upper Fort and the Lower Fort. British colonial buildings. The following is a partial list of buildings built during the British colonial period. Although many of them having been partially modified, they retain a typical colonial British style of architecture. Demographics. According to the 2011 India census, Bellary has a population of 409,444.Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%.Bellary has an average literacy rate of 75%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 82% of the males and 77% of females literate.12% of the population is under 6 years of age.While Kannada is the administrative language, Kannada and Telugu are dominant languages spoken by the residents, along with Dakhni (Deccan Urdu). A majority of the population is multilingual, speaking both Kannada and Telugu, and some speak Dakhni and Hindi as well. Education. Most graduate education in Bellary falls under the jurisdiction of Vijayanagara Sri Krishnadevaraya University and Visvesvaraya Technological University. The following is an abridged list of educational institutions of historical importance in the city: Founder father Kuss in 1939 Medical facilities. State owned. Most medical facilities are owned and maintained by the government, under the jurisdiction of VIMS. The most prominent hospitals in the city are: Industries. Steel industry. The city is surrounded by numerous iron and steel plants, owing to the availability of huge deposites of iron and manganese ore in the Sanduru hill ranges and surroundings. The following is an abridged list : Other industry. As Bellary area is richly deposited with Steel and other metal deposits, Many Sponge Iron industries are spread across all the district.

wikipedia-62935," Claus von Stauffenberg  Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, commonly referred to as Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (), Claus von Stauffenberg, or Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (15 November 1907 – 21 July 1944), was a German army officer and aristocrat who was one of the leading members of the failed 20 July plot of 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler and remove the Nazi Party from power. Along with Henning von Tresckow and Hans Oster, he was one of the central figures of the German Resistance movement within the ""Wehrmacht"". For his involvement in the movement he was shot shortly after the failed attempt known as Operation ""Valkyrie"". Family name. Stauffenberg's given name was Claus Philipp Maria Justinian, with the noble title at the end. He was born in the Stauffenberg castle of Jettingen between Ulm and Augsburg, in the eastern part of Swabia, at that time in the Kingdom of Bavaria, part of the German Empire. He was the third of four sons including the twins Berthold and Alexander and his own twin brother Konrad Maria, who died in Jettingen one day after birth on 16 November 1907. His father was Alfred Klemens Philipp Friedrich Justinian, the last ""Oberhofmarschall"" of the Kingdom of Württemberg. His mother was Caroline Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, née Gräfin von Üxküll-Gyllenband, the daughter of Alfred Richard August Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband and Valerie Gräfin von Hohenthal. The titles ""Graf"" and ""Gräfin"" mean count and countess, respectively. Schenk (i.e., cupbearer/butler) was an additional hereditary noble title. The ancestral castle of the nobility was the last part of the title, which would be Schenk Graf von ""Stauffenberg"" and used as part of the name. The Stauffenberg family is one of the oldest and most distinguished aristocratic Catholic families of southern Germany. Among his maternal Protestant ancestors were several famous Prussians, including Field Marshal August von Gneisenau. On 11 November 1919, a new constitutional law, as part of the Weimar Republic, abolished the privileges of nobility. Article 109 also stated, ""Legal privileges or disadvantages based on birth or social standing are to be abolished. Noble titles form part of the name only; noble titles may not be granted any more."" After this titles of nobility were incorporated as part of a surname. Early life. In his youth, he and his brothers were members of the ""Neupfadfinder"", a German Scout association and part of the German Youth movement. Like his brothers, he was carefully educated and inclined toward literature, but eventually took up a military career. In 1926, he joined the family's traditional regiment, the ""Bamberger Reiter- und Kavallerieregiment 17"" (17th Cavalry Regiment) in Bamberg. It was around this time that the three brothers were introduced by Albrecht von Blumenthal to poet Stefan George's influential circle, ""Georgekreis"", from which many notable members of the German resistance would later emerge. George dedicated ""Das neue Reich"" (""the new Empire"") in 1928, including the ""Geheimes Deutschland"" (""secret Germany"") written in 1922, to Berthold. The work outlines a new form of society ruled by a hierarchical spiritual aristocracy. George rejected any attempts to use it for political purposes, especially Nazism. Stauffenberg was commissioned as a ""leutnant"" (second lieutenant) in 1930. He studied modern weapons at the ""Kriegsakademie"" in Berlin-Moabit, but remained focused on the use of horses—which continued to carry out a large part of transportation duties throughout World War II—in modern warfare. His regiment became part of the German 1st Light Division under General Erich Hoepner, who had taken part in the plans for the September 1938 German Resistance coup, cut short by Hitler's unexpected diplomatic success in the Munich Agreement. The unit was among the troops that moved into the Sudetenland, the part of Czechoslovakia that had a German-speaking majority, as agreed upon in Munich. However, Stauffenberg disliked the method by which the Sudetenland was annexed and strongly disapproved of the invasion of Prague. Pre-war misgivings. Although Stauffenberg agreed with some of the Nazi Party's nationalistic aspects, he found many aspects of its ideology repugnant and never became a member of the party. Moreover, Stauffenberg remained a practicing Catholic. The Catholic Church had signed the ""Reichskonkordat"" in 1933, the year Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. Stauffenberg vacillated between a strong personal dislike of Hitler's policies and a respect for what he perceived to be Hitler's military acumen. On top of this, the growing systematic ill-treatment of Jews and suppression of religion had offended Stauffenberg's strong personal sense of Catholic religious morality and justice. World War II. Conquest of Poland, 1939. Following the outbreak of war in 1939, Stauffenberg and his regiment took part in the attack on Poland. He supported the occupation of Poland and its handling by the Nazi regime and the use of Poles as slave workers to achieve German prosperity as well as German colonization and exploitation of Poland. The deeply-rooted belief common in the German aristocracy was that the Eastern territories, populated predominantly by Poles and partly absorbed by Prussia in partitions of Poland, but taken from the German Empire after World War I, should be colonized as the Teutonic Knights had done in the Middle Ages. Stauffenberg said, ""It is essential that we begin a systemic colonization in Poland. But I have no fear that this will not occur"". It is certain that in the early stages of the war, he still held the usual aristocratic beliefs typical of late imperial times. Early appeals to join resistance, 1939. While his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, had approached him before to join the resistance movement against the Hitler regime, it was only after the Polish campaign that Stauffenberg began to consider it. Peter Yorck von Wartenburg and Ulrich Schwerin von Schwanenfeld urged him to become the adjutant of Walther von Brauchitsch, then Supreme Commander of the Army, in order to participate in a coup against Hitler. Stauffenberg declined at the time, reasoning that all German soldiers had pledged allegiance not to the institution of the presidency of the German ""Reich"", but to the person of Adolf Hitler, due to the ""Führereid"" introduced in 1934. Battle of France, 1940. Stauffenberg's unit was reorganized into the 6th Panzer Division, and he served as an officer on its General Staff in the Battle of France, for which he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. Like many others, Stauffenberg was impressed by the overwhelming military success, which was attributed to Hitler. Operation ""Barbarossa"", 1941. Operation ""Barbarossa"", the German invasion of the Soviet Union, was launched on June 22, 1941. The mass executions of Russians, Ukrainians, Jews and others, as well as what he believed was an already apparent deficiency in military leadership (Hitler had assumed the role of supreme commander in late 1941 after firing Hoepner and others), finally convinced Stauffenberg in 1942 to join with resistance groups within the ""Wehrmacht"", the only force that had a chance to overcome Hitler's Gestapo, SD, and SS. During the idle months of the so-called Phoney War, preceding the Battle of France (1939–40), he had already been transferred to the organizational department of the ""Oberkommando des Heeres"", the German army high command, which directed the operations on the Eastern Front. Stauffenberg opposed the Commissar Order, which Hitler wrote and then cancelled after a year. He tried to soften the German occupation policy in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union by pointing out the benefits of getting volunteers for the ""Ostlegionen"" which were commanded by his department. Guidelines were issued on 2 June 1942 for the proper treatment of prisoners of war from the Caucasus region who had been captured by ""Heeresgruppe A"". The Soviet Union had not signed the 1929 Geneva Convention. However, a month after the German invasion in 1941, an offer was made for a reciprocal adherence to the Hague Conventions. This 'note' was left unanswered by Third ""Reich"" officials. Stauffenberg did not engage in any coup plot at this time. The Stauffenberg brothers (Berthold and Claus) maintained contact with former commanders like Hoepner, and with the Kreisau Circle; they also included civilians and social democrats like Julius Leber in their scenarios for an administration after Hitler. According to Hoffman (p. 131, 1988) citing Brigadier (ret.) Oskar Alfred-Berger's letters, Stauffenberg had commented openly on the ill-treatment of the Jews when he ""expressed outrage and shock on this subject to fellow officers in General Staff Headquarters in Vinnitsa (Ukraine) during the summer of 1942."" Being interrogated after his capture by the Red Army on September 2, 1944, Stauffenberg's friend, Major Joachim Kuhn stated that Stauffenberg had told him in August 1942 that ""They are shooting Jews in masses. These crimes must not be allowed to continue."" After his arrest in July 1944, Stauffenberg’s older brother Berthold told the Gestapo that: “He and his brother had basically approved of the racial principle of National Socialism, but considered it to be ""exaggerated"" and ""excessive""”. Tunisia, 1942. In November 1942, the Allies landed in French North Africa, and the 10th Panzer Division occupied Vichy France (Case ""Anton"") before being transferred to fight in the Tunisia Campaign, as part of the ""Afrika Korps"". In 1943, Stauffenberg was promoted to ""Oberstleutnant i.G."" (lieutenant-colonel of the general staff), and was sent to Africa to join the 10th Panzer Division as its Operations Officer in the General Staff (Ia). On 19 February, Rommel launched his counter-offensive against British, American and French forces in Tunisia. The Axis commanders hoped to break rapidly through either the Sbiba or Kasserine Pass into the rear of the British 1st Army. The assault at Sbiba was halted, so that Rommel concentrated on Kasserine Pass where primarily the Italians in the form of their 7th Bersaglieri Regiment and 131st Centauro Armoured Division had defeated the American defenders. During the fighting, Stauffenberg drove up to be with the leading tanks and troops of the 10th Panzer Division. The division, together with the 21st Panzer Division, took up defensive positions near Mezzouna on 8 April. On 7 April 1943, Stauffenberg was involved in driving from one unit to another, directing their movement. Near Mezzouna, his vehicle was part of a column strafed by Kittyhawk (P-40) fighter bombers of the Desert Air Force – most likely from No. 3 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force – and he received multiple severe wounds.  Stauffenberg spent three months in a hospital in Munich, where he was treated by Ferdinand Sauerbruch. Stauffenberg lost his left eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand. He jokingly remarked to friends never to have really known what to do with so many fingers when he still had all of them. For his injuries, Stauffenberg was awarded the Wound Badge in Gold on 14 April and for his courage the German Cross in Gold on 8 May. In the resistance, 1943–1944. For rehabilitation, Stauffenberg was sent to his home, Schloss Lautlingen (today a museum), then still one of the Stauffenberg castles in southern Germany. Initially, he felt frustrated not to be in a position to stage a coup himself. But by the beginning of September 1943, after a somewhat slow recovery from his wounds, he was propositioned by the conspirators and was introduced to Henning von Tresckow as a staff officer to the headquarters of the ""Ersatzheer"" (""Replacement Army"" – charged with training soldiers to reinforce first line divisions at the front), located on the ""Bendlerstrasse"" (later ""Stauffenbergstrasse"") in Berlin. There, one of Stauffenberg's superiors was General Friedrich Olbricht, a committed member of the resistance movement. The ""Ersatzheer"" had a unique opportunity to launch a coup, as one of its functions was to have Operation ""Valkyrie"" in place. This was a contingency measure which would let it assume control of the ""Reich"" in the event that internal disturbances blocked communications to the military high command. Ironically, the ""Valkyrie"" plan had been agreed to by Hitler but was now secretly changed to sweep the rest of his regime from power in the event of his death. A detailed military plan was developed not only to occupy Berlin, but also to take the different headquarters of the German army and of Hitler in East Prussia by military force after the suicide assassination attempt by Axel von dem Bussche in late November 1943. Stauffenberg had von dem Bussche transmit these written orders personally to Major Kuhn once he had arrived at ""Wolfsschanze"" (Wolf's Lair) near Rastenburg, East Prussia. However, von dem Bussche had left the Wolfsschanze for the eastern front, after the meeting with Hitler was cancelled, and the attempt could not be made. Kuhn hid these compromising documents under a watch tower of the OKW, located not far from the Wolfsschanze. Kuhn became a prisoner of war of the Soviets after the 20 July plot. He led the Soviets to the hiding place of the documents in February 1945. In 1989, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev presented these documents to then-German chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl. These documents, produced by Stauffenberg and his fellow officers in 1943 in Berlin, evince the idealistic motivation of the resistance group. This had been doubted and was a matter of discussion for years in Germany after the war. Some thought the plotters wanted to kill Hitler in order to end the war and to avoid the loss of their privileges as professional officers and members of the nobility. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, the Allies had landed in France. Stauffenberg, like most other German professional military officers, had absolutely no doubt that the war was lost. Only an immediate armistice could avoid more unnecessary bloodshed and further damage to Germany, its people, and other European nations. However, in late 1943, he had written out demands with which he felt the Allies had to comply in order for Germany to agree to an immediate peace. These demands included Germany retaining its 1914 eastern borders, including the Polish territories of Wielkopolska and Poznań. Other demands included keeping such territorial gains as Austria and the Sudetenland within the Reich, giving autonomy to Alsace-Lorraine, and even expansion of the current wartime borders of Germany in the south by annexing Tyrol as far as Bolzano and Merano. Non-territorial demands included such points as refusal of any occupation of Germany by the Allies, as well as refusal to hand over war criminals by demanding the right of ""nations to deal with its own criminals"". These proposals were only directed to the Western Allies – Stauffenberg wanted Germany only to retreat from western, southern and northern positions, while demanding the right to continue military occupation of German territorial gains in the east. 20 July plot. As early as September 1942 von Stauffenberg was considering Hans Georg Schmidt von Altenstadt (:de:Hans Georg Schmidt von Altenstadt), author of ""Unser Weg zur Meer"", as a replacement for Hitler: ""Bereits im September 1942 hatte er Kenntnis von Plänen von Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg zur Beseitigung Hitlers."" From the beginning of September 1943 until 20 July 1944, von Stauffenberg was the driving force behind the plot to assassinate Hitler and take control of Germany. His resolve, organisational abilities, and radical approach put an end to inactivity caused by doubts and long discussions on whether military virtues had been made obsolete by Hitler's behaviour. With the help of his friend Henning von Tresckow, he united the conspirators and drove them into action. Stauffenberg was aware that, under German law, he was committing high treason. He openly told young conspirator Axel von dem Bussche in late 1943, """"ich betreibe mit allen mir zur Verfügung stehenden Mitteln den Hochverrat..."""" (""I am committing high treason with all my might and means...""). He justified himself to Bussche by referring to the right under natural law (""""Naturrecht"""") to defend millions of people's lives from the criminal aggressions of Hitler. Only after the conspirator General Helmuth Stieff on 7 July 1944 had declared himself unable to assassinate Hitler on a uniforms display at Klessheim castle near Salzburg, Stauffenberg decided to personally kill Hitler and to run the plot in Berlin. By then, Stauffenberg had great doubts about the possibility of success. Tresckow convinced him to go on with it even if it had no chance of success at all, ""The assassination must be attempted. Even if it fails, we must take action in Berlin"", as this would be the only way to prove to the world that the Hitler regime and Germany were not one and the same and that not all Germans supported the regime. Stauffenberg's part in the original plan required him to stay at the Bendlerstraße offices in Berlin, so he could phone regular army units all over Europe in an attempt to convince them to arrest leaders of Nazi political organisations such as the ""Sicherheitsdienst"" (SD) and the ""Gestapo"". Unfortunately, when General Helmuth Stieff, Chief of Operation at Army High Command, who had regular access to Hitler, backtracked from his earlier commitment to assassinate Hitler, Stauffenberg was forced to take on two critical roles: kill Hitler far from Berlin ""and"" trigger the military machine in Berlin during office hours of the very same day. Beside Stieff, he was the only conspirator who had regular access to Hitler (during his briefings) by mid-1944, as well as being the only officer among the conspirators thought to have the resolve and persuasiveness to convince German military leaders to throw in with the coup once Hitler was dead. This requirement greatly reduced the chance of a successful coup. After several unsuccessful tries by Stauffenberg to meet Hitler, Göring and Himmler when they were together, he went ahead with the attempt at ""Wolfsschanze"" on 20 July 1944. Stauffenberg entered the briefing room carrying a briefcase containing two small bombs. The location had unexpectedly been changed from the subterranean ""Führerbunker"" to Albert Speer's wooden barrack/hut due to it being a hot summer's day. He left the room to arm the first bomb with specially-adapted pliers, a task made difficult because he had lost his right hand and had only three fingers on his left. A guard knocked and opened the door, urging him to hurry as the meeting was about to begin. As a result, Stauffenberg was able to arm only one of the bombs. He left the second bomb with his ""aide-de-camp"", Werner von Haeften, and returned to the briefing room, where he placed the briefcase under the conference table, as close as he could to Hitler. Some minutes later, he excused himself and left the room. After his exit, the briefcase was moved by Colonel Heinz Brandt. When the explosion tore through the hut, Stauffenberg was convinced that no one in the room could have survived. Although four people were killed and almost all survivors were injured, Hitler himself was shielded from the blast by the heavy, solid-oak conference table leg and was only slightly wounded. Stauffenberg and Haeften quickly left and drove to the nearby airfield. After his return to Berlin, Stauffenberg immediately began to motivate his friends to initiate the second phase: the military coup against the Nazi leaders. When Joseph Goebbels announced by radio that Hitler had survived and later, after Hitler himself personally spoke on the state radio, the conspirators realised that the coup had failed. They were tracked to their ""Bendlerstrasse"" offices and overpowered after a brief shoot-out, during which Stauffenberg was wounded in the shoulder. Execution. In an attempt to save his own life, co-conspirator ""Generaloberst"" Friedrich Fromm, Commander-in-Chief of the Replacement Army present in the Bendlerblock (Headquarters of the Army), charged other conspirators in an impromptu court martial and condemned the ringleaders of the conspiracy to death. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, his aide 1st Lieutenant Werner von Haeften, General Friedrich Olbricht, and Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim were executed before 1:00 am that night (21 July 1944) by a makeshift firing squad in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, which was lit by the headlights of a truck. Stauffenberg was third in line to be executed, with Lieutenant von Haeften after. However, when it was Stauffenberg's turn, Lieutenant von Haeften placed himself between the firing squad and Stauffenberg, and received the bullets meant for Stauffenberg. When his turn came, Stauffenberg spoke his last words, """"Es lebe unser heiliges Deutschland!"""" (""""Long live our sacred Germany!"""") Others say the last words were: """"Es lebe das geheime Deutschland!"""" (""""Long live the secret Germany!"""") Fromm ordered that the executed officers (his former co-conspirators) receive an immediate burial with military honours in the Matthäus Churchyard in Berlin's Schöneberg district. The next day, however, Stauffenberg's body was exhumed by the SS, stripped of his medals and insignia, and cremated. Another central figure in the plot was Stauffenberg's eldest brother, Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. On 10 August 1944, Berthold was tried before Judge-President Roland Freisler in the special ""People's Court"" (""Volksgerichtshof""). This court was established by Hitler for political offences. Berthold was one of eight conspirators executed by slow strangulation (reputedly with piano wire used as the garrote) in Plötzensee Prison, Berlin, later that day. Before he was killed, Berthold was strangled and then revived multiple times. The entire execution and multiple resuscitations were filmed for Hitler to view at his leisure. More than 200 were condemned in show trials and executed. Hitler used the 20 July Plot as an excuse to destroy anyone he feared would oppose him. The traditional military salute was replaced with the Nazi salute also known as the Hitler salute. Eventually, over 20,000 Germans were killed or sent to concentration camps in the purge. Other views. Among the most active members of the German resistance and one of its few survivors, Hans Bernd Gisevius portrays Colonel Stauffenberg, whom he met in July 1944, as a man driven by reasons which had little to do with Christian ideals or repugnance of Nazi ideology. In his autobiographical ""Bis zum bitteren Ende"" (""To the Bitter End""), Gisevius writes: Richard J. Evans, Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, wrote three books on the Third Reich, and covers various aspects of Stauffenberg's beliefs and philosophy. He wrote an article originally published in ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"", 23 January 2009 entitled ""Why did Stauffenberg plant the bomb?"" which states, ""Was it because Hitler was losing the war? Was it to put an end to the mass murder of the Jews. Or was it to save Germany's honour? The overwhelming support, toleration, or silent acquiescence"" from the people of his country for Hitler, that was also being heavily censored and constantly fed propaganda meant any action must be swift and successful. Evans writes, ""Had Stauffenberg's bomb succeeded in killing Hitler, it is unlikely that the military coup planned to follow it would have moved the leading conspirators smoothly into power."" However, Karl Heinz Bohrer, a cultural critic, literary scholar, publisher, and visiting professor for German and Comparative Studies at Stanford University, criticized Evans' views in an article originally published in the ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"", January 30, 2010. Although agreeing that Evans is historically correct in much of his writing, Bohrer feels that Evans twists time lines and misrepresents certain aspects. He wrote of Evans, ""In the course of his problematic argument he walks into two traps: 1. by contesting Stauffenberg's ""moral motivation""; 2. by contesting Stauffenberg's suitability as role model."" He further writes, ""If then, as Evans notes with initial objectivity, Stauffenberg had a strong moral imperative – whether this stemmed from an aristocratic code of honour, Catholic doctrine or Romantic poetry – then this also underpinned his initial affinity for National Socialism which Stauffenberg misinterpreted as 'spiritual renewal.' "" In 1980, the German government established a memorial for the failed anti-Nazi resistance movement in a part of the Bendlerblock, the remainder of which currently houses the Berlin offices of the German Ministry of Defense (whose main offices remain in Bonn). The ""Bendlerstrasse"" was renamed the ""Stauffenbergstrasse"", and the Bendlerblock now houses the Memorial to the German Resistance, a permanent exhibition with more than 5,000 photographs and documents showing the various resistance organizations at work during the Hitler era. The courtyard where the officers were shot on 21 July 1944 is now a memorial site, with a plaque commemorating the events and a bronze figure of a young man with his hands symbolically bound which resembles Count von Stauffenberg. Family. Stauffenberg married Nina Freiin von Lerchenfeld on 26 September 1933 in Bamberg. They had five children: Berthold; Heimeran; Franz-Ludwig; Valerie; and Konstanze, who was born in Frankfurt on the Oder after Stauffenberg's execution. Berthold, Heimeran, Franz-Ludwig and Valerie, who were not told of their father's deed, were placed in a foster home for the remainder of the war and were forced to use new surnames, as ""Stauffenberg"" was now considered taboo. Nina died at the age of 92 on 2 April 2006 at Kirchlauter near Bamberg, and was buried there on 8 April. Berthold went on to become a general in West Germany's post-war ""Bundeswehr"". Franz-Ludwig became a member of both the German and European parliaments, representing Bavaria. In 2008, Konstanze von Schulthess-Rechberg wrote a best-selling book about her mother, ""Nina Schenk Graefin von Stauffenberg"". Describing her late husband, Nina von Stauffenberg said:He let things come to him, and then he made up his mind ... one of his characteristics was that he really enjoyed playing the devil's advocate. Conservatives were convinced that he was a ferocious Nazi, and ferocious Nazis were convinced he was an unreconstructed conservative. He was neither. "

At one stage, Anabel Medina Garrigues switched with Tursunov so that Tursunov and Robredo were on one side, while Medina Garrigues and Petrova were on the other. The umpire, playing along, assigned points to Spain regardless. He then played at the 2007 Australian Open reaching the third round losing to Tomáš Berdych.

He then faced fourth seed Ivan Dodig in the final and won his seventh ATP title. Davis Cup. As Tursunov's form started to improve and he came into calculation for selection in the Russia Davis Cup team, the problems he was having obtaining United States citizenship became apparent. Tursunov had for years attempted to become a United States citizen, but the process has stalled and Tursunov travels with a Russian passport and an American visa. In his own words ""It's frustrating, but what can you do?"""" ""In spite of this, Tursunov was selected for Russia in the Davis Cup semi final against Croatia and won his dead rubber match against Ivo Karlović. In 2006 in the first round tie against Netherlands, he won both his matches against Raemon Sluiter and Melle van Gemerden. He then defeatied Richard Gasquet in five sets in the fourth rubber of the quarterfinal; consequently sending the Russians into the semi-finals of the Davis Cup. For the second time in 2006, Tursunov sealed victory for Russia in the Davis Cup; this time in the semi-final where he defeated Andy Roddick of the United States in a match that lasted 4 hours and 48 minutes, ending 17–15 in the last set. By virtue of this victory, he earned Russia the spot in the Davis Cup final against Argentina, which took place in December. Despite, earning the winning match in the quarterfinals and semifinals, Tursunov only played doubles partnering with Marat Safin, which they won to give Russia a 2–1 lead. Marat Safin later sealed the 2006 Davis Cup win for Russia with his victory over José Acasuso. Tursunov was named in the four-man team that played the United States in the Davis Cup final in 2007, in Portland, Oregon, from 30 November – 2 December 2007. Tursunov lost the first rubber of the 2007 Davis Cup final against Roddick. Tursunov was on the verge of defeating James Blake, but Blake won in the 4th dead rubber, the USA having won the tie in the previous doubles match. In 2008, Tursunov lost both his matches in the first round tie against Serbia losing in doubles and in singles, however they still won the tie 3–2. In the semifinal tie against Argentina, he won his doubles match playing with Igor Kunitsyn. In 2009, Tursunov sealed the victory for Russia, in the first round tie against Romania defeating Victor Hănescu in five sets. In 2011, he won his singles match against Sweden, however it didn't matter as Russia already lost the tie losing the first 3 matches. Music. He has been mixing personal dance track compilations since he was a teenager, using them for practice sessions. Awards. Tursunov was the December month in the 2009 Association of Tennis Professionals calendar. "
wikipedia-5777185," BILL 2 Anti-tank guided weapon  The BILL 2 Anti-Tank Guided Weapon is a man-portable or vehicle-mounted guided anti-tank missile using the overfly top attack method to attack the weaker parts of an armoured vehicle. The weapon is currently in service with the Swedish Army. System. Design. The BILL 2 was designed upon the original BILL 1 Anti-tank guided weapon that has been in the service of the Swedish Army since 1988. The BILL 2 is currently produced by Saab Bofors Dynamics, who are located in Karlskoga, Sweden. The BILL 2 comes with one 10.5 kg missile, a launching tube, tripod with x7 magnification day sight, and one thermal imaging sight. Operation. The BILL 2 uses OTA or Overfly Top Attack to attack its target. The missile flies towards the target on a standard horizontal trajectory, but rather than directly hitting the target head on, it overflies it, detonating its warhead on top of an armored vehicle, where the armour is usually lighter. It also utilizes additional guidance accuracy via the installed rate gyro, which monitors the tracking movement of the launcher. It is designed primarily to attack armoured or unarmoured vehicles, but can also be used to attack helicopters or soft ground targets, such as light buildings.  The BILL 2 can be mounted onto a variety of vehicles and then fired remotely from inside the vehicle. Firing Modes. The BILL 2 has three firing modes that the launcher's operator can select, before launching the missile. Missile. The BILL 2 Missile uses a SACLOS or semi-automatic command to line-of-sight guidance system, and is controlled via a communications wire that trails behind the missile from the launch tube. The BILL 2 warhead has an optical and magnetic sensor. The optical sensor serves to find the target’s range, while the magnetic sensor detects metallic targets to determine the best point for the missile to detonate. The BILL 2 contains both a proximity fuse and an inertial impact fuse. The BILL 2 is armed with a pair of vertically striking Explosively formed penetrator warheads, which each direct a self-forging slug of metal downwards at extreme velocities using a high explosive blast. The 40mm frontal ""precursor"" warhead destroys any reactive armour protecting the target and leaves the 110mm rear warhead to penetrate the armour. Total penetration capabilities are classified, but are known to be at least 550mm in rolled homogeneous armor. "
wikipedia-142910," Creativity  Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and valuable is created (such as an idea, a joke, a literary work, a painting or musical composition, a solution, an invention etc.). The range of scholarly interest in creativity includes a multitude of definitions and approaches involving several disciplines; psychology, cognitive science, education, philosophy (particularly philosophy of science), technology, theology, sociology, linguistics, business studies, and economics, taking in the relationship between creativity and general intelligence, mental and neurological processes associated with creativity, the relationships between personality type and creative ability and between creativity and mental health, the potential for fostering creativity through education and training, especially as augmented by technology, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of learning and teaching processes. Definition. In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: ""Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products"" (Mumford, 2003, p. 110). Creativity can also be defined ""as the process of producing something that is both original and worthwhile"" or ""characterized by originality and expressiveness and imaginative"". What is produced can come in many forms and is not specifically singled out in a subject or area. Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature. Aspects of creativity. Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as ""the four Ps"" - process, product, person and place. A focus on ""process"" is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as Guilford), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as Wallas) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ""product"" usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful memes. The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more. A focus on the nature of the creative ""person"" considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of ideation, autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior and so on. A focus on ""place"" considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility. An article by R.J. Sternberg in the ""Creativity Research Journal"" reviewed the ""investment"" theory of creativity as well as the ""propulsion"" theory of creative contribution, suggesting that there are eight types of creative contribution; ""replication"" - confirming that the given field is in the correct place - ""redefinition"" - the attempt to redefine where the field is and how it is viewed - ""forward incrementation"" - a creative contribution that moves the field forward in the direction in which it is already moving - ""advance forward movement"" - which advances the field past the point where others are ready for it to go - ""redirection"" - which moves the field in a new, different direction - ""redirection from a point in the past"" - which moves the field back to a previous point to advance in a different direction - ""starting over/ re-initiation"" - moving the field to a different starting point - and ""integration"" - combining two or more diverse ways of thinking about the field into a single way of thinking. Historical importance. James C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a ""four C"" model of creativity; ""mini-c"" (""transformative learning"" involving ""personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions and insights""), ""little-c"" (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ""Pro-C"" (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ""Big-C"" (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analysing creative processes in individuals. The contrast of terms ""Big C"" and ""Little c"" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity Margaret Boden distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal). Robinson and Anna Craft have focussed on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between ""high"" and ""little c"" creativity. and cites Ken Robinson as referring to ""high"" and ""democratic"" creativity. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity. Etymology. The lexeme in the English word ""creativity"" comes from the Latin term ""creō"" ""to create, make"": its derivational suffixes also come from Latin. The word ""create"" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation (in The Parson's Tale). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after the Enlightenment. History of the concept. Ancient views. Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of Ancient Greece, Ancient China, and Ancient India, lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to ""to create"" or ""creator"" except for the expression """"poiein"""" (""to make""), which only applied to ""poiesis"" (poetry) and to the ""poietes"" (poet, or ""maker"") who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ""The Republic"", ""Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?"", he answers, ""Certainly not, he merely imitates."" It is commonly argued that the notion of ""creativity"" originated in Western culture through Christianity, as a matter of divine inspiration. According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, ""the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the ""Genesis""."" However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work. A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods. Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative ""daemon"" (Greek) or ""genius"" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance. It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of ""great men"". The Enlightenment and after. The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later. The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance, when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment. By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment, mention of creativity (notably in art theory), linked with the concept of imagination, became more frequent. In the writing of Thomas Hobbes, imagination became a key element of human cognition; William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius, typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius. As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century. Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism. In particular they refer to the work of Francis Galton, who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz (1896) and Henri Poincaré (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes. Twentieth century to the present day. The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas and Max Wertheimer. In his work ""Art of Thought"", published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages: Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with ""intimation"" seen as a sub-stage. Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ""Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity"". In 1927, Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ""Process and Reality."" He is credited with having coined the term ""creativity"" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: ""Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded"". The formal psychometric measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the topic and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination, but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity(as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down. Creative process. There has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs. Incubation. Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight. There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of ""incubation"" in Wallas' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables ""forgetting"" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem. This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks. Convergent and divergent thinking. J. P. Guilford drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ""flexible"" thinking or fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity. Creative Cognition Approach. In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the ""Geneplore"" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts. Weisberg argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory. Helie and Sun recently proposed a unified framework for understanding creativity in problem solving, namely the Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight). The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely 1) The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 2) The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 3) The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 4) The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing; and 5) The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena. Conceptual blending. In ""The Act of Creation"", Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of ""bisociation""—that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference. This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the '90s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor, analogy and structure mapping have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label conceptual blending. Honing Theory. Honing theory posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview, and that it is by way of the creative process the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places equal emphasis on the externally visible creative outcome and the internal cognitive restructuring brought about by the creative process. Indeed one factor that distinguishes it from other theories of creativity is that it focuses on not just restructuring as it pertains to the conception of the task, but as it pertains to the worldview as a whole. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed. Thus another distinguishing feature of honing theory is that the creative process reflects the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge; it mends itself as does a body when it has been injured. Yet another central, distinguishing feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state. Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with. Honing theory can account for many phenomena that are not readily explained by other theories of creativity. For example, creativity was commonly thought to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is actually associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing. Honing theory also makes several predictions that differ from what would be predicted by other theories. For example, empirical support has been obtained using analogy problem solving experiments for the proposal that midway through the creative process one's mind is in a potentiality state. Other experiments show that different works by the same creator exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice', and that this same recognizable quality even comes through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. This theory has been developed by Liane Gabora. Creativity and everyday imaginative thought. In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think ""if only..."". Their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes. It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought. Measuring creativity. Creativity quotient. Several attempts have been made to develop a ""creativity quotient"" of an individual similar to the intelligence quotient (IQ), however these have been unsuccessful. In Malcolm Gladwell's 2008 book ""Outliers: The Story of Success"", there is mentioning of a ""divergence test"". As opposed to ""convergence tests"", where a test taker is asked to sort through a list of possibilities and ""converge"" on the right answer, a divergence test requires one to use imagination and take one's mind in as many different directions as possible. ""With a divergence test, obviously there isn't a single right answer. What the test giver is looking for are the number and uniqueness of your responses. And what the test is measuring isn't analytical intelligence but something profoundly different -- something much closer to creativity. Divergence tests are every bit as challenging as convergence tests."" Psychometric approach. J. P. Guilford's group, which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967: Building on Guilford's work, Torrance developed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking in 1966. They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on: The Creativity Achievement Questionnaire, a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output. Such tests, sometimes called ""Divergent Thinking (DT)"" tests have been both supported and criticized. Social-personality approach. Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals. A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be ""more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile,and impulsive."" Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed. Within the framework of the Big Five model of personality some consistent traits have emerged. Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity. Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, conscientious, and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists. Other approaches to measurement. Howard Gruber insisted on a case-study approach that expresses the existential and unique quality of the creator. Creativity to Gruber was the product of purposeful work and this work could be described only as a confluence of forces in the specifics of the case. Declining U.S. creativity? Creativity as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking increased until 1990 in the United States, an effect similar to the Flynn effect. Thereafter scores have been declining. Possible causes include increased time spent watching TV, increased time spent playing computer games, or lacking nurturing of creativity in schools. There may also be a mistaken assumption that encouraging creativity in schools necessarily involve the arts when it also can be encouraged in other subjects. A growing global educational reform movement commonly known as 21st Century Learning aims to promote creativity across the curriculum. In general, it advocates teaching lifelong skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and communication for core academic subjects including Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM), as well as the arts. Insofar as the movement promotes a new focus on teaching/learning creativity and innovation skills through activities that promote higher-order thinking skills, it also requires the development of additional metrics to score originality and innovation, as well as technical correctness. Odyssey of the Mind is a non-profit educational program that provides challenging divergent problems to foster original thinking across the curriculum, and has effectively promoted creativity education worldwide since the 1970s. Odyssey of the Mind World Finals is the pinnacle international team-based creative problem-solving competition, and an annual festival to celebrate creativity education. Odyssey of the Mind helps educators easily implement 21st Century Learning Skills at every learning level, and has been sponsored by NASA to encourage creativity education in the United States. Creativity and intelligence. There has been debate in the psychological literature about whether intelligence (as measured by IQ) and creativity are part of the same process (the conjoint hypothesis) or represent distinct mental processes (the disjoint hypothesis). Evidence from attempts to look at correlations between intelligence and creativity from the 1950s onwards, by authors such as Barron, Guilford or Wallach and Kogan, regularly suggested that correlations between these concepts were low enough to justify treating them as distinct concepts. Some researchers believe that creativity is the outcome of the same cognitive processes as intelligence, and is only judged as creativity in terms of its consequences, i.e. when the outcome of cognitive processes happens to produce something novel, a view which Perkins has termed the ""nothing special"" hypothesis. An often cited model is what has come to be known as ""the threshold hypothesis,"" proposed by Ellis Paul Torrance, which holds that a high degree of intelligence appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for high creativity. That is, while there is a positive correlation between creativity and intelligence, this correlation disappears for IQs above a threshold of around 120. Such a model has found acceptance by many researchers, although it has not gone unchallenged. A study in 1962 by Getzels and Jackson among high school students concluded that high IQ and high creativity tend to be mutually exclusive with a majority of the highest scoring students being either highly creative or highly intelligent, but not both. While this explains the threshold, the exact interaction between creativity and IQ remains unexplained. A 2005 meta-Analysis found only small correlations between IQ and creativity tests and did not support the threshold theory. An alternative perspective, Renzulli's three-rings hypothesis, sees giftedness as based on both intelligence and creativity. Many experts have suggested a relationship between associative memory and creativity. Neurobiology of creativity. The neurobiology of creativity has been addressed in the article ""Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms."" The authors write that ""creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected."" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways: Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity. This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, mood and addiction disorders, and depression. In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and dopamine from the limbic system. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition, and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas. Working memory and the cerebellum. Vandervert described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of working memory (responsible for processing all thought) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum. The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes where creative and innovative thoughts arise. (Apparently, creative insight or the ""aha"" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.) According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in ""forward"" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC). New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion, Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the child prodigy, and thought in general. Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem. Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans. Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology. Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive ""mental prototyping"" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy. REM sleep. Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process. REM rather than NREM sleep appears to be responsible. This has been suggested to be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep. During this period of sleep, high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the neocortex, and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus. This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing ""neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."" Creativity and affect. Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in voting behavior the term ""affect"" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making. Creativity and positive affect relations. According to Alice Isen, positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity: Barbara Fredrickson in her broaden-and-build model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity. According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope). Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect Creativity and negative affect relations. On the other hand, some theorists have suggested that negative affect leads to greater creativity. A cornerstone of this perspective is empirical evidence of a relationship between affective illness and creativity. In a study of 1,005 prominent 20th century individuals from over 45 different professions, the University of Kentucky's Arnold Ludwig found a slight but significant correlation between depression and level of creative achievement. In addition, several systematic studies of highly creative individuals and their relatives have uncovered a higher incidence of affective disorders (primarily bipolar disorder and depression) than that found in the general population. Creativity and affect at work. Three patterns may exist between affect and creativity at work: positive (or negative) mood, or change in mood, predictably precedes creativity; creativity predictably precedes mood; and whether affect and creativity occur simultaneously. It was found that not only might affect precede creativity, but creative outcomes might provoke affect as well. At its simplest level, the experience of creativity is itself a work event, and like other events in the organizational context, it could evoke emotion. Qualitative research and anecdotal accounts of creative achievement in the arts and sciences suggest that creative insight is often followed by feelings of elation. For example, Albert Einstein called his 1907 general theory of relativity ""the happiest thought of my life."" Empirical evidence on this matter is still very tentative. In contrast to the possible incubation effects of affective state on subsequent creativity, the affective consequences of creativity are likely to be more direct and immediate. In general, affective events provoke immediate and relatively fleeting emotional reactions. Thus, if creative performance at work is an affective event for the individual doing the creative work, such an effect would likely be evident only in same-day data. Another longitudinal research found several insights regarding the relations between creativity and emotion at work. Firstly, evidence shows a positive correlation between positive affect and creativity. The more positive a person's affect on a given day, the more creative thinking they evidenced that day and the next day—even controlling for that next day's mood. There was even some evidence of an effect two days later. In addition, the researchers found no evidence that people were more creative when they experienced both positive and negative affect on the same day. The weight of evidence supports a purely linear form of the affect-creativity relationship, at least over the range of affect and creativity covered in our study: the more positive a person's affect, the higher their creativity in a work setting. Finally, they found four patterns of affect and creativity: affect can operate as an antecedent to creativity; as a direct consequence of creativity; as an indirect consequence of creativity; and affect can occur simultaneously with creative activity. Thus, it appears that people's feelings and creative cognitions are interwoven in several distinct ways within the complex fabric of their daily work lives. Formal theory of creativity. Jürgen Schmidhuber's formal theory of creativity postulates that creativity, curiosity and interestingness are by-products of a simple computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs. The agent can use a black box optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's objective function to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model ""wow-effects."" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present ""wow-effect"" due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are ""boring"" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration. According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists and comedians. For example, physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished physical laws permitting better data compression. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements. Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for ""inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punch line, related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."" Schmidhuber argues that that ongoing computer hardware advances will greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artists based on simple implementations of the basic principle since 1990. He used the theory to create low-complexity art and an attractive human face. Creativity and mental health. A study by psychologist J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ""right"" prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity. Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. unipolar disorder). In ""Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament"", Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo. A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresenation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives. Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder. However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports. According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress. Creativity in various contexts. Creativity has been studied from a variety of perspectives and is important in numerous contexts. Most of these approaches are undisciplinary, and it is therefore difficult to form a coherent overall view. The following sections examine some of the areas in which creativity is seen as being important. Creativity Profiles. Creativity can be expresses in a number of different forms, depending on the unique people and environments it exists. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four ""Creativity Profiles"" that can help achieve such goals. Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at Manchester Business School has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling. An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the psychometric approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference. One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ""divergent production"". ""divergent production"" is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. One way of measuring ""divergent production"" is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions. Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects. The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people. From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people. Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity. From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society. In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination  Another theory of creative people is the ""investment theory of creativity"". This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremelly high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ""investment"" sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or underrecognized idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ""investment theory of creativity"" views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way. Creativity in diverse cultures. Creativity is viewed differently in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems. Creativity in art and literature. Most people associate creativity with the fields of art and literature. In these fields, ""originality"" is considered to be a sufficient condition for creativity, unlike other fields where both ""originality"" and ""appropriateness"" are necessary. Within the different modes of artistic expression, one can postulate a continuum extending from ""interpretation"" to ""innovation"". Established artistic movements and genres pull practitioners to the ""interpretation"" end of the scale, whereas original thinkers strive towards the ""innovation"" pole. Note that we conventionally expect some ""creative"" people (dancers, actors, orchestral members, etc.) to perform (interpret) while allowing others (writers, painters, composers, etc.) more freedom to express the new and the different. Contrast alternative theories, for example: In the art practice and theory of Davor Dzalto, human creativity is taken as a basic feature of both the personal existence of human being and art production. For this thinker, creativity is a basic cultural and anthropological category, since it enables human manifestation in the world as a ""real presence"" in contrast to the progressive ""virtualization"" of the world. Psychological examples from science and mathematics. Jacques Hadamard, in his book ""Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field"", uses introspection to describe mathematical thought processes. In contrast to authors who identify language and cognition, he describes his own mathematical thinking as largely wordless, often accompanied by mental images that represent the entire solution to a problem. He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of his day (ca. 1900), asking them how they did their work. Many of the responses mirrored his own. Hadamard described the experiences of the mathematicians/theoretical physicists Carl Friedrich Gauss, Hermann von Helmholtz, Henri Poincaré and others as viewing entire solutions with ""sudden spontaneity."" The same has been reported in literature by many others, such as Denis Brian, G. H. Hardy, Walter Heitler, B. L. van der Waerden, and Harold Ruegg. To elaborate on one example, Einstein, after years of fruitless calculations, suddenly had the solution to the general theory of relativity revealed in a dream ""like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision."" Hadamard described the process as having steps (i) preparation, (ii) incubation, (iv) illumination, and (v) verification of the five-step Graham Wallas creative-process model, leaving out (iii) intimation, with the first three cited by Hadamard as also having been put forth by Helmholtz: Marie-Louise von Franz, a colleague of the eminent psychiatrist Carl Jung, noted that in these unconscious scientific discoveries the ""always recurring and important factor ... is the simultaneity with which the complete solution is intuitively perceived and which can be checked later by discursive reasoning."" She attributes the solution presented ""as an archetypal pattern or image."" As cited by von Franz, according to Jung, ""Archetypes ... manifest themselves only through their ability to ""organize"" images and ideas, and this is always an unconscious process which cannot be detected until afterwards."" Creative industries and services. Today, creativity forms the core activity of a growing section of the global economy—the so-called ""creative industries""—capitalistically generating (generally non-tangible) wealth through the creation and exploitation of intellectual property or through the provision of creative services. The Creative Industries Mapping Document 2001 provides an overview of the creative industries in the UK. The creative professional workforce is becoming a more integral part of industrialized nations' economies. Creative professions include writing, art, design, theater, television, radio, motion pictures, related crafts, as well as marketing, strategy, some aspects of scientific research and development, product development, some types of teaching and curriculum design, and more. Since many creative professionals (actors and writers, for example) are also employed in secondary professions, estimates of creative professionals are often inaccurate. By some estimates, approximately 10 million US workers are creative professionals; depending upon the depth and breadth of the definition, this estimate may be double. Creativity in other professions. Creativity is also seen as being increasingly important in a variety of other professions. Architecture and industrial design are the fields most often associated with creativity, and more generally the fields of design and design research. These fields explicitly value creativity, and journals such as ""Design Studies"" have published many studies on creativity and creative problem solving. Fields such as science and engineering have, by contrast, experienced a less explicit (but arguably no less important) relation to creativity. Simonton shows how some of the major scientific advances of the 20th century can be attributed to the creativity of individuals. This ability will also be seen as increasingly important for engineers in years to come. Accounting has also been associated with creativity with the popular euphemism ""creative accounting"". Although this term often implies unethical practices, Amabile has suggested that even this profession can benefit from the (ethical) application of creative thinking. In a recent global survey of approximately 1600 CEO's, the leadership trait that was considered to be most crucial for success was creativity. This suggests that the world of business is beginning to accept that creativity is of value in a diversity of industries, rather than being simply the preserve of the creative industries. For instance, the civil service (opularly derided as wholly opposite to the creative), has benefitted from employing creative writers, from John Milton, to Anthony Trollope, to 'Flann O'Brien', who are capable of analysing the workings of their own institutions. Creativity in organizations. It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself - how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes. Amabile argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed: There are two types of motivation: Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are: Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations. In particular, he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has to play in the creative process. In business, originality is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and actionable. Creative competitive intelligence is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to innovation process and competitive intelligence to creative workers. Economic views of creativity. Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects - the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation). In the early 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of ""creative destruction"", to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as Paul Romer) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws. Mark A. Runco and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a ""psychoeconomic"" model of creativity. In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility, and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations. The ""creative class"" is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ""The Rise of the Creative Class"", economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with ""3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance"" also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development. The creative industries in Europe - including the audiovisual sector - make a significant contribution to the EU economy, creating about 3% of EU GDP - corresponding to an annual market value of €500 billion - and employing about 6 million people. In addition, the sector plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, in particular for devices and networks. The EU records the second highest TV viewing figures globally, producing more films than any other region in the world. In that respect, the newly proposed 'Creative Europe' programme will help preserve cultural heritage while increasing the circulation of creative works inside and outside the EU. The programme will play a consequential role in stimulating cross border co-operation, promoting peer learning and making these sectors more professional. The Commission will then propose a financial instrument run by the European Investment Bank to provide debt and equity finance for cultural and creative industries. The role of the non-state actors within the governance regarding Medias will not be neglected anymore due to a holistic approach . Fostering creativity. Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ""A Whole New Mind"", repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ""conceptual age"", we will need to foster and encourage ""right-directed thinking"" (representing creativity and emotion) over ""left-directed thinking"" (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data. Nickerson provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry: Some see the conventional system of schooling as ""stifling"" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the pre-school/kindergarten and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children. Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise. In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so. See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought. Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks. Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it. Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the psychological-cognitive, such as Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process, Synectics, Science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and Edward de Bono's lateral thinking; to the highly structured, such as TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller), and Computer-Aided Morphological analysis. Understanding and enhancing the creative process with new technologies. A simple but accurate review on this new Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) angle for promoting creativity has been written by Todd Lubart, an invitation full of creative ideas to develop further this new field. Groupware and other Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) platforms are now the stage of Network Creativity on the web or on other private networks. These tools have made more obvious the existence of a more connective, cooperative and collective nature of creativity rather than the prevailing individual one. Creativity Research on Global Virtual Teams is showing that the creative process is affected by the national identities, cognitive and conative profiles, anonymous interactions at times and many other factors affecting the teams members, depending on the early or later stages of the cooperative creative process. They are also showing how NGO's cross-cultural virtual team's innovation in Africa would also benefit from the pooling of best global practices online. Such tools enhancing cooperative creativity may have a great impact on society and as such should be tested while they are built following the Motto: ""Build the Camera while shooting the film"". Some European FP7 scientific programs like Paradiso are answering a need for advanced experimentally driven research including large-scale experimentation test-beds to discover the technical, societal and economic implications of such groupware and collaborative tools to the Internet. On the other hand, creativity research may one day be pooled with a computable metalanguage like IEML from the University of Ottawa Collective Intelligence Chair, Pierre Levy. It might be a good tool to provide an interdisciplinary definition and a rather unified theory of creativity. The creative processes being highly fuzzy, the programming of cooperative tools for creativity and innovation should be adaptive and flexible. Empirical Modelling seems to be a good choice for Humanities Computing. If all the activity of the universe could be traced with appropriate captors, it is likely that one could see the creative nature of the universe to which humans are active contributors. After the web of documents, the Web of Things might shed some light on such a universal creative phenomenon which should not be restricted to humans. In order to trace and enhance cooperative and collective creativity, Metis Reflexive Global Virtual Team has worked for the last few years on the development of a Trace Composer at the intersection of personal experience and social knowledge. Metis Reflexive Team has also identified a paradigm for the study of creativity to bridge European theory of ""useless"" and non-instrumentalized creativity, North American more pragmatic creativity and Chinese culture stressing more creativity as a holistic process of continuity rather than radical change and originality. This paradigm is mostly based on the work of the German philosopher Hans Joas, one that emphasizes the creative character of human action. This model allows also for a more comprehensive theory of action. Joas elaborates some implications of his model for theories of social movements and social change. The connection between concepts like creation, innovation, production and expression is facilitated by the creativity of action as a metaphore but also as a scientific concept. The Creativity and Cognition conference series, sponsored by the ACM and running since 1993, has been an important venue for publishing research on the intersection between technology and creativity. The conference now runs biennially, next taking place in 2011. Social attitudes to creativity. Although the benefits of creativity to society as a whole have been noted, social attitudes about this topic remain divided. The wealth of literature regarding the development of creativity and the profusion of creativity techniques indicate wide acceptance, at least among academics, that creativity is desirable. There is, however, a dark side to creativity, in that it represents a """"quest for a radical autonomy apart from the constraints of social responsibility"""". In other words, by encouraging creativity we are encouraging a departure from society's existing norms and values. Expectation of conformity runs contrary to the spirit of creativity. Ken Robinson argues that the current education system is ""educating people out of their creativity"". Nevertheless, employers are increasingly valuing creative skills. A report by the Business Council of Australia, for example, has called for a higher level of creativity in graduates. The ability to ""think outside the box"" is highly sought after. However, the above-mentioned paradox may well imply that firms pay lip service to thinking outside the box while maintaining traditional, hierarchical organization structures in which individual creativity is condemned.

wikipedia-454794," Abdul Rahman Munif  Abdul Rahman Munif (May 29, 1933 – January 24, 2004) () was a Jordanian-born Saudi novelist. His novels include strong political elements and parodies of the Middle Eastern elite class. Life. Munif was born a Saudi national and brought up in Amman, Jordan to Saudi parents and an Iraqi grandmother. In 1952 he moved to Baghdad to study law and later moved to Cairo. He received a law degree from the Sorbonne and a PhD in oil economics from the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics. He later returned to Iraq to work in the oil ministry and became a member of the Ba'ath Party. He began writing in the 1970s after he left his job with the Iraqi ministry, quit the Ba'ath party, and moved to Damascus, Syria, removing himself from a regime he opposed. He quickly became known for his scathing parodies of Middle Eastern elites, especially those of Saudi Arabia, a country which banned many of his books and stripped him of Saudi citizenship. He used his knowledge of the oil industry to full effect criticizing the businessmen who ran it and the politicians they served. Munif was the author of a total of fifteen novels. The ""Cities of Salt"" quintet followed the evolution of the Arabian peninsula as its traditional Bedouin culture is transformed by the oil boom. The novels create a history of a broad region, evoking comparisons to William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. The quintet begins with ""Al-tih"" (1984, ""Cities of Salt"") in the desert oasis of Wadi al-Uyoun that is disrupted by the arrival of Western oilmen in an image similar to that of the disrupted village of Chinua Achebe's ""Things Fall Apart"". As Achebe described the effects on a traditional African village of the arrival of powerful missionaries, so Munif chronicles the economic, social, and psychological effects of the promise of immeasurable wealth drawn from the deserts of nomad and oasis communities. The quintet continues with ""Al-ukhdud"" (1985;""The Trench""), ""Taqasim al-layl wa-al-nahar"" (1989; ""Variations on Night and Day""), ""Al-munbatt"" (1989; ""The Uprooted""), and ""Badiyat al zulumat"" (1989; ""The Desert of Darkness""). Daniel Burt ranked the quintet as the 71st greatest novel of all time. The last two novels in the series have not been translated into English. While his works were never particularly successful in the west, throughout the Middle East they are critically acclaimed and extremely popular. ""Cities of Salt"" was described by Edward Said as the ""only serious work of fiction that tries to show the effect of oil, Americans and the local oligarchy on a Gulf country."" While he was one of the fiercest critics of Saddam Hussein and his regime, he was utterly opposed to the American invasion of Iraq and spent the last two years of his life working on non-fiction projects to oppose what he saw as renewed imperialism.

wikipedia-14077377," Saint Arthur of Glastonbury  Saint Arthur of Glastonbury (died November 15, 1539), according to some French sources, was an English Roman Catholic faithful in the 16th century. He was martyred during the period of King Henry VIII's suppression of the Catholic Church due to his refusal to accept the king's claim to spiritual leadership of the Church in England. English Catholic sources lack information on St. Arthur of Glastonbury's martyrdom under Henry VIII. It is possible that the legendary King Arthur of Camelot, believed to have been connected with Glastonbury, and the story of a local martyr may have been conflated in Breton oral tradition; there were a number of Catholic martyrs during the English Reformation who hailed from the region including Richard Whyting of Glastonbury Abbey. Martyred with Whyting was John Arthur Thorne, treasurer of the abbey and owner of the original Glastonbury chair. St. Arthur's feastday is celebrated regionally on November 15 in Brittany. "

wikipedia-3181893," Mantrap  Mantraps are physical security devices or constructions designed to trap, disable, or kill a human. Historical usage. Historically, mantraps were mechanical devices for catching poachers and trespassers. The devices have taken many forms, the most usual being like a large foothold trap, the steel springs being armed with teeth which met in the victim's leg. Since 1827, they have been illegal in England, except in houses between sunset and sunrise as a defence against burglars. Also, other traps such as special snares, trap netting, trapping pits, fluidizing solid matter traps and cage traps could be used.  Mantraps that use deadly force are illegal in the United States, and there have been notable tort law cases where the trespasser has successfully sued the property owner for damages caused by the mantrap. As noted in the important US court case of ""Katko v. Briney"", ""the law has always placed a higher value upon human safety than upon mere rights of property."" Modern usage. In modern physical security protocols, a man trap refers to a small space having two sets of interlocking doors, such that the first set of doors must close before the second set opens. They are also known as air locks in the security industry.  In a manual man trap, a guard locks and unlocks each door in sequence. An intercom and/or video camera are often used to allow the guard to control the trap from a remote location. In an automatic man trap, identification may be required for each door, sometimes even possibly different measures for each door. For example, a key may open the first door, but a personal identification number entered on a number pad opens the second. Other methods of opening doors include proximity cards or biometric devices such as fingerprint readers or iris recognition scans.  Metal detectors are often built in, in order to prevent entrance of people carrying weapons. Such use is particularly frequent in banks and jewelry shops.  Fire codes require that automatic man traps allow exit from the intermediate space while denying access to a secure space such as a data center or research lab. A manually operated man trap may allow a guard to lock both doors, trapping a suspect between the doors for questioning or detainment. In a lower-security variation of a mantrap, banks often locate automated teller machines within the dead space between the entrance doors and the interior lobby doors to prevent ATM robbery and night walk-up robberies. Entry access by ATM card to the dead space offers additional customer protection. "
wikipedia-283951," Sombor  Sombor (Serbian Cyrillic: Сомбор, , ) is a city located in the province of Vojvodina, Serbia. The city has a total population of 47,623 (as of 2011), while its administrative area (including neighboring villages) has 85,903 inhabitants.

In Serbian, the city is known as ""Sombor"" (Сомбор), in Hungarian and German as ""Zombor"", in Croatian and Bunjevac as ""Sombor"", in Rusyn as ""Zombor"" (Зомбор), and in Turkish as ""Sonbor"". The older Hungarian name for the city was ""Czoborszentmihály"". The name originates from the Czobor family, who were the owners of this area in the 14th century (The family name came from the Slavic name ""Cibor""). The Serbian name for the city ""(Sombor)"" also came from the family name Czobor, and was first recorded in 1543, although the city was mentioned in historical documents under several more names, such as ""Samobor, Sambor, Sambir, Sonbor, Sanbur, Zibor,"" and ""Zombar"". An unofficial Serbian name used for the city is ""Ravangrad"" (Раванград), which means ""flat town"" in English. History. The first historical record about the city is from 1340. The city was administered by the Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century, when it became part of the Ottoman Empire. During the establishment of Ottoman authority, local Hungarian population left from this region. During the Ottoman administration, the city was populated mostly by ethnic Serbs. It was called ""Sonbor"" during Ottoman administration and was a kaza centre in Sanjak of Segedin at first in Budin Province till 1596, and then in Eğri Province between 1596 and 1687. In 1665, a well-known traveller, Evlia Celebi, visited Sombor and wrote: ""All the folk (in the city) are not Hungarian, but Wallachian-Christian (Serb). These places are something special; they do not belong to Hungary, but are a part of Bačka and Wallachia. Most of the inhabitants are traders, and all of them wear frontiersmen clothes; they are very polite and brave people."" According to Celebi, the city had 200 shops, 14 mosques and about 2,000 houses. Since 1687, the city was under Habsburg administration, and was included into the Habsburg Military Frontier.

wikipedia-25364746," Set animal  In ancient Egyptian art, the Set animal, or sha, is a chimerical beast, the totemic animal of the god Set. Because Set was identified with the Greek Typhon, the animal is also commonly known as the Typhonian animal or Typhonic beast. There may be some relation between the sha and the modern Egyptian cryptid known as the salawa. Hieroglyphic representation. The ancient Egyptian Set-animal, Gardiner no. E20, E21, is one of the portrayals of the God Set. The other common hieroglyph used to represent Set is a seated, jackal-headed god, Gardiner no. C7. The linguistic use in the Egyptian language is as the determinative, for words portraying ""items with chaos"", example words related to ""suffering, violence, perturbation."" Also for the 'violent storms' of the atmosphere, a ""tempest"". According to Egyptologist Richard H. Wilkinson, the first known use of the Set animal was upon the Scorpion Macehead of King Scorpion, Dynasty 0. It was soon thereafter portrayed mounted upon the serekhs of Seth-Peribsen and Khasekhemwy. Physical characteristics. The sha is usually depicted as a slender dog, resembling a greyhound or a jackal, with three distinguishing features: a stiff tail, often forked at the end, which stands straight up or at an angle, whether the animal is sitting, standing, or walking; its ears, also held erect, are usually depicted as squarish or triangular, narrowest at the base and widest at the squarish tops; and a long nose, often with a slight downward curve. It is normally depicted as black, but may also have been reddish. Ancient Egypt. Drawings of the sha appear in Egyptian artwork from predynastic times until at least the period of the New Kingdom, a period of some two thousand years. Although sometimes described as a fantastic or composite animal, it was depicted in a realistic manner more typical of actual creatures. The sha is found on a ceremonial mace-head dating to the predynastic period; on the serekhs of the Second Dynasty kings Peribsen and Khasekhemwy; in Twelfth Dynasty tombs at Beni-hasan; and, in the form of Set, in the royal cartouches of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings Seti I and Seti II, and the Twentieth Dynasty king Setnakhte and his descendants. Association with Set. The god Set was usually depicted as a man with a head resembling that of the sha, usually with a long, slightly curved nose, and erect ears, squared at the tops. Occasionally he was represented in animal form as the sha itself, although he was also depicted in the form of an ass or as a black pig. Other animals sacred to Set included the antelope, hippopotamus, wild boar, crocodile, and scorpion, all of which represented strength, power, protection, or wildness. The sha was also used as a determinative in the names of Set and the goddess Nubt, who may be identified with Nephthys, the wife of Set. In art, Set was mostly depicted as a mysterious and unknown creature, referred to by Egyptologists as the ""Set animal"" or ""Typhonic beast"", with a curved snout, square ears, forked tail, and canine body, or sometimes as a human with only the head of the ""Set animal"". It has no complete resemblance to any known creature, although it does resemble a composite of an aardvark, a donkey, and a jackal. In some descriptions he has the head of a greyhound. The earliest known representation of Set comes from a tomb dating to the Naqada I phase of the Predynastic Period (""circa"" 4000 BC–3500 BC), and the ""Set-animal"" is even found on a mace-head of the Scorpion King, a Protodynastic ruler. ""Was"" (""power"") scepters represent the Set-animal. ""Was"" scepters were carried by gods, pharaohs, and priests, as a symbol of power, and in later use, control over the force of chaos (Set). The head and forked tail of the Set-animal are clearly present. ""Was"" scepters are often depicted in paintings, drawings, and carvings of gods, and remnants of real ""was"" scepters have been found constructed of faience or wood. Both the Second Dynasty kings Peribsen and Khasekhemwy, whose serekhs depict the sha, identified themselves as divine manifestations of Set on earth, as previous kings had identified themselves with Horus. During the Old Kingdom, Horus and Set were generally viewed as twin supporters and defenders of the god Ra, head of the Egyptian pantheon; and they were often depicted anointing the king, as the divine source of his authority. The association of Horus and Set probably reflected the reconciliation of a struggle between two royal cults. Following the unification of Egypt, Narmer and the kings of the First Dynasty embraced the worship of Horus, by adopting the ""Horus name"" as part of their official nomenclature. This name identified the king as the god's representative on earth. Peribsen, however, chose a ""Set name"" in place of a Horus name, while Khasekhemwy's royal title invoked both of the great gods, presumably in an attempt to reconcile the followers of each cult. Disappearance of the Sha. Although Set was originally viewed as the son and defender of Ra, and the Egyptian kings, his reputation amongst the people declined along with the rise of the cult of Osiris. Originally a vegetation god, Osiris became one of the pre-eminent gods of the Egyptian pantheon. His worship stressed the role of Set as violence personified; the murderer of his brother, and usurper of his throne, who instead of standing alongside Horus, became his eternal enemy. This view of Set was encouraged during the Second Intermediate Period, when Egypt was invaded by the Hyksos, a Semitic people from the east, whose god 'Sutekh' became identified with Set. Set continued to be revered during the New Kingdom. Several kings of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties had royal names indicating their devotion to Set, and these names were written with a hieroglyphic representation of the god (Gardiner no. C7) as a determinative. Here Set is depicted as a seated deity with the head of a sha. However, during the Third Intermediate Period, Set was deeply unpopular, his worship abandoned, and many depictions of him were destroyed or defaced. References to and depictions of the sha, which was closely linked with Set, must have suffered a similar fate. Identification. Depictions of the sha as an animal appear distinctly canine, but the precise identity of the animal has never been firmly established. It is sometimes described as a jackal or some other wild dog, although the jackal is usually identified with the god Anubis. In connection with Anubis, the jackal is never depicted with the distinguishing features of the sha: the stiff, often forked tail; the squared ears; and the long, slightly curved nose. It is conceivable that these features were added to representations of the jackal solely in order to distinguish Set from Anubis. Early representations of the sha frequently omit the fork at the end of the tail, or show it with something resembling a tuft instead, so the idea of the forked tail may have been symbolic. However, some scholars believe the sha to be a stylized representation of some other animal, such as an African hunting dog, a pig, an antelope, an okapi, a giraffe, or even an aardvark; or that it might represent a species that was rare in Egyptian times, and has since become extinct. Since Set was later represented as a donkey or with the head of a donkey, it is possible the donkey was the inspiration for the sha. Others have speculated that it is a purely fantastic or composite animal, which never existed in nature; this was the opinion of Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge. Because the name ""sha"" is not as familiar as that of Set, and has no independent mythology associated with it, the animal is commonly referred to as the ""Set"" or ""Seth Animal"", or the ""Typhonian Animal"", so called because the Greeks equated Set or Sutekh with the monster Typhon. Salawa cryptid. In the 1960s, and again in April 1997, stories circulated in Egypt about a mysterious canid, dubbed the ""salawa"" or ""sal'awa"" (scary wolf). The creature allegedly attacked several small villages in remote parts of southern Egypt, resulting in several injuries and even deaths. A contemporary report indicates that one of the animals was killed by residents of the Qattamiya suburb and tentatively identified by local police as a hyena. During filming of a 2009 episode of the SyFy channel program, ""Destination Truth"", an animal suspected by the film crew of being the salawa was determined to be a fennec fox. This variety of fox is another possible identification for the sha. Its large, squarish ears and slender legs, its solitary habits, and its reddish fur are all consistent with representations of the sha, although the animal's other features must have become highly stylized.

wikipedia-564846," Slack-key guitar  Slack-key guitar is a fingerstyle genre of guitar music that originated in Hawaii. Its name refers to its characteristic open tunings: the English term is a translation of the Hawaiian ""kī hōalu"", which means ""loosen the key"". Most slack-key tunings can be achieved by starting with a guitar in standard tuning and detuning or ""slacking"" one or more of the strings until the six strings form a single chord, frequently G major. History. In the oral-history account, the style originated from Mexican cowboys in the late 19th century. These ""paniolo"" (a Hawaiianization of ""españoles""—""Spaniards"") provided guitars, taught the Hawaiians the rudiments of playing, and then left, allowing the Hawaiians to develop the style on their own. Musicologists and historians suggest that the story is more complicated, but this is the version that is most often offered by Hawaiian musicians. Slack key guitar adapted to accompany the rhythms of Hawaiian dancing and the harmonic structures of Hawaiian music. The style of Hawaiian music that was promoted as a matter of national pride under the reign of King David Kalākaua in the late 19th century combined rhythms from traditional dance meters with imported European forms (for example, military marches), and drew its melodies from chant (""mele"" and ""oli""), hula, Christian hymns (""hīmeni""), and the popular music brought in by the various peoples who came to the Islands: English-speaking North Americans, Mexicans, Portuguese, Filipinos, Puerto Ricans, Tahitians, and Samoans. The music did not develop a mainland audience during the Hawaiian music craze of the early 20th century, during which Hawaiian music came to be identified outside of Islands with the steel guitar and the ukulele. Slack key remained private and family entertainment, and it was not even recorded until 1946-47, when Gabby Pahinui cut a series of records that brought the tradition into public view. During the 1960s and particularly during the Hawaiian Cultural Renaissance of the 1970s, slack key experienced a surge in popularity and came to be seen as one of the most genuine expressions of Hawaiian spirit, principally thanks to Gabby Pahinui, Leonard Kwan, Sonny Chillingworth, Raymond Kāne, and the more modern styles of younger players such as Keola Beamer, his brother Kapono Beamer, Peter Moon, and Haunani Apoliona. During this period, luthiers such as the Guitar and Lute Workshop in Honolulu specialized in the development and manufacture of guitars bespoke for slack-key performance. Many currently prominent Hawaii-based players got their starts during the Cultural Renaissance years: Cindy Combs, Ledward Kaapana, George Kahumoku, Jr., his brother Moses Kahumoku, Dennis Kamakahi, Ozzie Kotani, three Pahinui brothers (Bla, Cyril, and Martin), the Emerson Brothers and Owana Salazar. These artists, and slack key in general, have become well-known outside of Hawaii largely through George Winston's Dancing Cat Records record label, which has most often showcased the music in solo settings. One indication of slack key's increasing visibility beyond the Islands is that the first four winners of the Grammy Award for Best Hawaiian Music Album were slack key collections: ""Slack Key Guitar, Volume 2"" in 2005, ""Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar, Volume 1"" in 2006, ""Legends of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar—Live from Maui"" and ""Treasures of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar - Live in Concert from Maui."" Players from outside Hawaii have also taken up the tradition, for example, Chet Atkins (who included slack key pieces on two of his albums), Yuki Yamauchi (a student of Raymond Kāne's and an advocate of Hawaiian music in Japan), pianist George Winston, and Canadian Jim ""Kimo"" West (perhaps better known as guitarist with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic). Techniques and tunings. ""Kī hōalu"" is often characterized by the use of an alternating-bass pattern, usually played by the thumb on the lower two or three strings of the guitar, while the melody is played on the three or four highest strings, using any number of fingers. Many ""kī hōalu"" players incorporate various embellishments such as harmonics (chimes), the hammer-on, the pull-off, slides, and damping. Slack key compositions exhibit characteristics from indigenous Hawaiian and imported musical traditions. The vamp or turnaround (a repeated figure, usually at the end of a verse) is descended from the hula tradition, and other harmonic and structural features are descended from ""hīmeni"" and from the ""hula kui"" encouraged by King David Kalakaua. Nearly all slack key requires retuning the guitar strings from the standard EADGBE, and this usually means lowering or ""slacking"" several strings. The result is most often a major chord, although it can also be a major-seventh chord, a sixth, or (rarely) a minor. There are examples of slack key played in standard tuning, but the overwhelming majority of recorded examples use altered tunings. The most common slack key tuning, called ""taro patch,"" makes a G major chord. Starting from the standard EADGBE, the high and low E strings are lowered or ""slacked"" to D and the fifth string from A down to G, so the notes become DGDGBD. As the chart below shows, there are also major-chord tunings based on C, F, and D. Another important group of tunings, based on major-seventh chords, is called """"wahine"""". G wahine, for example, starts with taro patch and lowers the third string from G to F, making DGDFBD. Wahine tunings have their own characteristic vamps (as in, for example, Raymond Kāne's ""Punahele"" or Gabby Pahinui's 1946 ""Hula Medley"") and require fretting one or two strings to form a major chord. A third significant group is Mauna Loa tunings, in which the highest pair of strings are a fifth apart: Gabby Pahinui often played in C Mauna Loa, CGEGAE. George Winston has identified fifty slack key tunings Some are only commonly used for a single song, or by particular players. Mike McClellan and George Winston have developed similar schemes that organize the tunings by key and type. The chart below follows their categories and naming conventions. "
wikipedia-56148," Taranto  Taranto (; ; Ancient Greek: ""Tarās""; Modern Greek: ""Tarantas, Taranta""; Tarantino ""Tarde"") is a coastal city in Puglia, Southern Italy. It is the capital of the Province of Taranto and is an important commercial port as well as the main Italian naval base. It is the third-largest continental city of Southern Italy: according to 2011 population census, it has a population of 200,154. Taranto is an important commercial and military port. It has well-developed steel and iron foundries, oil refineries, chemical works, some shipyards for building warships, and food-processing factories. Overview. Taranto's pre-history dates back to 706 BC when it was founded as a Greek colony. The ancient city was situated on a peninsula on which the modern city has been built over the ancient Greek city of which only a few ruins remain including part of the city wall, two temple columns dating to the 6th century BC and tombs. The islets of ""S. Pietro"" and ""S. Paolo"" (St. Peter and St. Paul) protect the bay, called ""Mar Grande"" (""Big Sea""), where the commercial port is located. Another bay, called ""Mar Piccolo"" (""Little Sea""), is formed by the peninsula of the old city, and has flourishing fishing. ""Mar Piccolo"" is a military port with strategic importance. At the end of the 19th century, a channel was excavated to allow the military ships to enter ""Mar Piccolo"" harbour, and the ancient Greek city become an island connected to the mainland by bridges. In addition, the islets and the coast are strongly fortified. Because of the presence of these two bays, Taranto is also called “the city of the two seas”. The Greek colonists from Sparta called the city Taras (), after the mythical hero Taras, while the Romans, who connected the city to Rome with an extension of the Appian way, called it Tarentum. The natural harbor at Taranto made it a logical home port for the Italian naval fleet before and during the First World War. During World War II, Taranto became famous as a consequence of the November 1940 British air attack on the Regia Marina naval base stationed here, which today is called the Battle of Taranto. Taranto is also the origin of the common name of the Tarantula spider family, Theraphosidae, even though strictly speaking there are no members of Theraphosidae in the area. In ancient times, residents of the town of Taranto, upon being bitten by the large local Wolf Spider, ""Lycosa tarentula"", would promptly do a long vigorous dance like a Jig. This was done in order to sweat the venom out of their pores, even though the spider's venom was not fatal to humans. The frenetic dance became known as the Tarantella. Physical geography. Taranto faces the Ionian Sea. It is 14.5 metres above sea level. It was built on a plain running north/northwest - southeast, and surrounded by the Murgia plateau from the north west to the east. Its territory extends for 209,64 km2 and is mostly underwater. It is characterised by three natural peninsulars and a man-made island, formed by digging a ditch during the construction of Aragon Castle. The city is known as the ""city of two seas"" because it is washed by the Great Sea in the bay between Punta Rondinella to the northwest and Capo San Dante to the south, and by the vast reservoir of the Little Sea. The Great Sea and the Little Sea. The Great Sea is frequently known as the ""Great Sea bay"" as that is where ships harbour. It is separated from the Little Sea by a cape which closes the gulf, leading to the artificial island. This island formed the heart of the original city and it's connected to the mainland by the Ponte di Porta Napoli and the Ponte Girevole. The Great Sea is separated from the Ionian Sea by the Capo San Vito, the Isole Cheradi of St Peter and St Paul, and the three islands of San Nicolicchio, which are completely incorporated by the steel plant. The latter form a little archipelago which close off the arc creating the natural Great Sea bay. The Little Sea is considered to be a lagoon so it presents problems of water exchange. It is virtually divided into two by the Ponte Punta Penna Pizzone, which joins the Punta Penna to the Punta Pizzone. The first of these forms a rough triangle, whose corners are the opening to the east and the Porta Napoli channel linking it to the Great Sea in the west. The second half forms an ellipse whose major axis measures almost from the south-west to the north-east. The Galeso river flows into the first half. The two seas have slightly different winds and the tides and underwater springs of different salinities. These affect the currents on the surface and in the depths of the Great Sea and the two halves of the Little Sea. In the Great Sea and in the northern part of the Little Sea, there are some underwater springs called citri, which carry undrinkable freshwater together with salt water. This creates the ideal biological conditions for cultivating Mediterranean mussels, known locally as ""cozze"". Climate. The climate of the city, recorded by the weather station situated near the Grottaglie Military Airport, is typical of the Mediterranean with frequent Continental features. The spring is usually mild and rainy, but it's not uncommon to have sudden cold spells come in from the east, which often cause snowfall. The summer is very hot and humid, with temperatures reaching up to 40 degrees C. On November 28, 2012 a large F3 tornado (Likely an EF4 or even possibly an EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale), hit the port of Taranto and damaged the Taranto Steel Mill where workers were protesting against the plant's pollution emissions, about 20 people were injured, and another man was reported missing. The tornado is one of 9 to hit Italy since October 1. It is classified as Geographical zone C and having a degree-day of 30. History. Taranto was founded in 706 BC by Dorian Greek immigrants as the only Spartan colony, and its origin is peculiar: the founders were Partheniae (""sons of virgins""), sons of unmarried Spartan women and ""Perioeci"" (free men, but not citizens of Sparta); these out-of-wedlock unions were permitted extraordinarily by the Spartans to increase the prospective number of soldiers (only the citizens of Sparta could become soldiers) during the bloody Messenian wars, but later they were retroactively nullified, and the sons were then obliged to leave Greece forever. Phalanthus, the Parthenian leader, went to Delphi to consult the oracle: the puzzling answer designated the harbour of Taranto as the new home of the exiles. The Partheniae arrived in Apulia, and founded the city, naming it ""Taras"" after the son of the Greek sea god, Poseidon, and of a local nymph, Satyrion. According to other sources, Heracles founded the city. Another tradition indicates Taras as the founder of the city; the symbol of the Greek city (as well as of the modern city) depicts the legend of Taras being saved from a shipwreck by riding a dolphin that was sent to him by Poseidon. Taranto increased its power, becoming a commercial power and a sovereign city of Magna Graecia, ruling over the Greek colonies in southern Italy. Its independence and power came to an end as the Romans expanded throughout Italy. Taranto won the first of two wars against Rome for the control of Southern Italy: it was helped by Pyrrhus, king of Greek Epirus, who surprised Rome with the use of elephants in battle, a thing never seen before by the Romans. The second war was conversely won by Rome, which subsequently cut off Taranto from the centre of Mediterranean trade, by connecting the Via Appia directly to the port of Brundisium (Brindisi). Taranto as a centre of ancient art. Like many Greek city states, Taras issued its own coins in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. The denomination was a Nomos, a die-cast silver coin whose weight, size and purity were controlled by the state. The highly artistic coins presented the symbol of the city, Taras being saved by a dolphin, with the reverse side showing the likeness of a hippocamp, a horse-fish amalgam which is depicted in mythology as the beast that drew Poseidon's chariot. Taras was also the center of a thriving decorated Greek pottery industry during the 4th century BC. Most of the South Italian Greek vessels known as Basilican ware were made in different workshops in the city. Unfortunately, none of the names of the artists have survived, so modern scholars have been obliged to give the recognizable artistic hands and workshops nicknames based on the subject matter of their works, museums which possess the works, or individuals who have distinguished the works from others. Some of the most famous of the Apulian vase painters at Taras are now called: the Iliupersis Painter, the Lycurgus Painter, the Gioia del Colle Painter, the Darius Painter, the Underworld Painter, and the White Sakkos Painter, among others. The wares produced by these workshops were usually large elaborate vessels intended for mortuary use. The forms produced included volute kraters, loutrophoroi, paterai, oinochoai, lekythoi, fish plates, etc. The decoration of these vessels was red figure (with figures reserved in red clay fabric, while the background was covered in a black gloss), with overpainting (sovradipinto) in white, pink, yellow, and maroon slips. Often the style of the drawings are very florid, and frilly, as was already the fashion in Fourth-Century Athens. Distinctive South Italian features also begin to appear. Many figures are shown seated on rocks. Floral motifs become very ornate, including spiraling vines and leaves, roses, lilies, poppies, sprays of laurel, acanthus leaves, etc. Often the subject matter consists of naiskos scenes (scenes showing the statue of a deceased person in a naos, a miniature temple or shrine). Most often the naiskos scene occupies one side of the vase, while a mythological scene occupies the other. Images depicting many of the Greek myths are only known from South Italian vases, since Athenian ones seem to have had more limited repertoires of depiction. Environment. In 1991 Taranto was declared a high environmental risk area by the Ministry of Environment. As a consequence of the poisons discharged into the air by the factories in the area (most notably the ILVA steel plant, part of Gruppo Riva), Taranto is the most polluted city in Italy and western Europe. Only 7% of Taranto's pollution is inhabitants-related: 93% is factories-related. The European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER) showed that in 2004, estimated dioxin emissions from the ILVA plant were responsible for 83% of Italy's total reported emissions. Every year Taranto's inhabitants inhale 2.7 tons of carbon monoxide and 57.7 tons of carbon dioxide. The latest data provided by the INES, the Italian national institute of emissions and their sources (""Inventario nazionale delle emissioni e loro sorgenti""), confirm that Taranto stands comparison with China's Linfen and Copşa Mică in Romania, the most polluted cities in the world due to factories' emissions. In particular, Taranto has dioxin. 92% of Italy's dioxin is produced there and, in other terms, 8.8% of the dioxin in Europe. In ten years, leukaemias, myelomas and lymphomas increased by 30–40%. Furthermore, dioxin accumulates over the years: so far at least 9 kilos of dioxin have been discharged into Taranto's air by its factories, i.e. three times the quantity discharged in the Seveso disaster (the one in 1976 where the Italian city Seveso was contaminated by dioxin). Grazing is banned within of the Ilva plant. Municipal bankruptcy. The Municipality of Taranto was declared bankrupt because - as ascertained by Francesco Boccia, chief of the liquidation committee - as of 31 December 2005, it had accrued liabilities in an amount equal to 637 million euros. This is one of the biggest financial crises which has ever hit a municipality. The fact that the municipality went bankrupt was officially declared on 18 October 2006 by the receiver Tommaso Blonda, appointed further to the resignation of the mayor, Rossana Di Bello, following her one-year-and-four-months imprisonment after her conviction for abuse of office and documental forgery in relation to investigations made on the contract for the management of the city incinerator given to the company Termomeccanica. Architecture and landmarks. Taranto has a number of sites of historic value. Sitting along the ""Little Sea"", The Aragonese Castle was built in the 15th century with the intention to protect the town from the Turks' frequent raids. The castle replaced a pre-existing fort which was deemed unfit for 15th century warfare. The old town, including Piazza Fontana, the church of San Domenico, the ""Madonna della Salute"" Sanctuary, and a number of old ""palazzi"", is standing exactly as it did a thousand years ago, when the Byzantines rebuilt what the Saracens had razed to the ground in 927 AD. The picturesque alleyways, arches and stairwells, along with the old crafts workshops, contribute to its unique atmosphere. Taranto features several Greek temple ruins - some stretching as far back as the 6th century BC - such as the remains of a Doric Temple still visible on Piazza Castello. A number of 18th-century ""palazzi"" adorn the town centre. For years, they served as the main residence of local aristocratic families and these include Palazzo Carducci-Artenisio (1650), Palazzo Galeota (1728) and Palazzo Latagliata. The Ponte Girevole (swing bridge), built in 1887, runs across the navigable ship canal that joins ""Mar Piccolo"" (""Little Sea"") with ""Mar Grande"" (""Big Sea"") and stretches along 89.9 meters or 294.95 ft. When the bridge is open, the two ends of the city are literally left without connection. An important institution of Taranto is the ""Galileo Ferraris"" high school, founded in 1848, located in via Mascherpa 10. This school is famous for its highly-developed level of instruction, due to the high quality of its teachers and students. Others schools are: IIS Archita, IIS Quinto Ennio (in Literature), IIS Aristosseno (Languages), and ITIS Pacinotti (in IT) and ITC V. Bachelet (in Commercial and Accounting - famous for the activities at BIT MILANO). The Promenade (""lungomare""), named after former Italian king Victor Emmanuel III, overlooks the ""Mar Grande"", with the imposing views of its natural harbour and commercial port. Society. Demographic evolution. ""Census populations"" Dialect. The city is the centre of the Tarantino dialect (""Dialètte tarandine"") of the Sicilian language. As a result of the city's history, it is influenced by Greek, Vulgar Latin and French. International relations. Taranto is twinned with: Notable people. These historical figures have had a relationship with the city. Not all of them were actually born in Taranto. "
wikipedia-1525753," Toronto Public Library  Toronto Public Library (TPL) () is a public library system based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the largest public library system in Canada and in 2008, had averaged a higher circulation per capita than any other public library system internationally, making it the largest neighbourhood-based library system in the world. Within North America, it also had the highest circulation and visitors when compared to other large urban systems. Established as the library of the Mechanics' Institute in 1830, the Toronto Public Library now consists of 98 branch libraries and has over 12 million items in its collection. History. In 1830, a library was established in the York Mechanics' Institute. In 1884, the collection became the Toronto Public Library. James Bain was the first chief librarian and he supplemented the collection with $15,000 worth of books purchased on a trip to England in late 1883. Between 1907 and 1916, ten libraries were built with funds from the Andrew Carnegie Trust. Several of these Carnegie libraries continue to be used by the public library; one, the original Central Reference Library, is now the Koffler Student Centre at the University of Toronto. Prior to the Amalgamation of Toronto in 1998, each of the former municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto operated their own public libraries. They include: When the Government of Ontario amalgamated the former municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto, the individual library boards and the Toronto Reference Library merged into the Toronto Public Library. The merger caused the Toronto Public Library to become the largest library system in North America, serving a population of 2.3 million people with 98 branches at the time. In 2004, a new library was opened in the St. James Town neighbourhood of Toronto, bringing the total number of branches to 99. A new branch is scheduled to open at Fort York and in Scarborough City Centre in 2014. The Municipal Affairs branch closed in September 2011, bringing the number of branches to back to 98. Governance. The Toronto Public Library is governed by a Board appointed by Toronto City Council. The Board is composed of eight citizen members, four Toronto City Councillors and the Mayor or his designate. The current Members of the Toronto Public Library Board have been appointed until late 2014, (or until their successors are appointed). Services. Collections. The library's collection count is approximately 11 million items, including books, periodicals and audio-visual materials. Along with general interest fiction and nonfiction there are numerous special collections. Focused collecting efforts strive to meet multi-language and social needs. Notable special collections include The Arthur Conan Doyle Collection, The Merril Collection of Science Fiction, The Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books, and The Rita Cox Black and Caribbean Heritage Collection. eBook & eMagazine Services. The Toronto Public Library offers the following audiobook, e-book, and eMagazine services: Technology. The Toronto Public Library technology services include public access computers and free wireless internet access in all branches. The Library also provides access to its collections online, including books, music and movies, research databases, journals, magazines, online educational and literacy support resources and ongoing digitization of specialized collections. The Toronto Public Library website allows users to reserve books, DVDs and CDs and have them transferred to the user's preferred branch. Bookmobiles. The TPL operates two Bookmobile buses (24' Blue Bird CS), targeting communities who lack easy access to a neighbourhood branch. Currently there are 32 regular Bookmobile stops in Toronto, including one on Ward's Island. The bookmobile concept was previously used in the library systems of the former municipalities of North York and Scarborough as well as in Toronto as far back as 1955. "
wikipedia-3551092," Nutbush City Limits  ""Nutbush City Limits"" is a semi-autobiographical funk and soul song written and originally performed by Tina Turner in which she commemorates her rural hometown of Nutbush, Tennessee. Released June 1973, shortly before her separation from then-husband and musical partner Ike Turner, ""Nutbush City Limits"" was the last hit single the duo would produce together. In the years since, ""Nutbush City Limits"" has been covered by a number of other artists—most notably Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band—and Tina Turner herself has re-recorded several different versions of the song. As an unincorporated town, Nutbush does not officially have ""city limits""; rather, its boundaries are described by ""Nutbush—Unincorporated"" signs posted on the local highway. Recordings. 1973 original version. The first recording of ""Nutbush City Limits"" was produced by Ike Turner at his Inglewood, California facility, Bolic Sound Studio, in May 1973 and released as a single the following month by the couple under their professional name, Ike & Tina Turner. Though Ike composed the music, he did not list his name in the credits alongside Tina, who wrote the lyrics. This version is characterized by inventive guitar sounds, a substantial synthesizer solo, and a funky brass section. The song later appeared on their album of the same title, released November 1973, and proved to be the duo's final significant chart hit, reaching #11 on ""Billboard"" Hot Soul Singles, #22 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100, and #4 on the UK Singles Chart. The album also appeared on the ""Billboard"" Soul LPs chart, peaking at #21 during its run. Following the couple's split, the song became a staple of Tina's live show where she reworked the funky studio version into a hard-driving rock and roll showstopper. Typical of the period, none of the session musicians who contributed to ""Nutbush City Limits"" were given specific mention in the song credits. It has been rumored for years that Marc Bolan, frontman for the glam rock band T. Rex, played guitar on the track. Gloria Jones, his girlfriend at the time—who herself provided backing vocals for Ike & Tina Turner during the 1960s—asserted that this was the case in the 2007 BBC4 documentary ""Marc Bolan: The Final Word"". This claim is bolstered by the fact that Bolan toured the U.S. extensively and resided in the Los Angeles area during the mid-1970s, and is also acknowledged to have played on the Ike & Tina Turner singles ""Sexy Ida (Part 2)"" and ""Baby—Get It On"". However, a 2008 ""Ebony"" magazine article about Ike Turner's death identified James ""Bino"" Lewis, then a member of Ike & Tina's backing band Kings of Rhythm, as the guitarist. Re-recordings. 1988 live version. A live recording of ""Nutbush City Limits"" from Turner's 1986–1987 ""Break Every Rule Tour"" was released as the lead single to promote the 1988 double album ""Tina Live in Europe"", but it was in fact a different recording than the one that appeared on the official concert album. While this version did not manage to register much of an impact on any charts, the single is notable for being one of the very first by Turner to be released on compact disc, at that time a relatively new format, in addition to 7"" and 3-track 12"" vinyl editions. Both the CD and 12"" singles featured a 10-minute 57-second live rendition of ZZ Top's song ""Legs"" from their 1983 album ""Eliminator"", which was not included on the ""Tina Live in Europe"" album. A shorter version of ""Legs"", recorded during Turner's 1993 ""What's Love? Tour"", would later appear on her 1994 CD box set ""The Collected Recordings - Sixties to Nineties"". 1991 remixes. Turner re-recorded ""Nutbush City Limits"" in a modern dance style—subtitled ""The 90s Version""—for inclusion on her 1991 compilation album ""Simply the Best"". Upon its release as a single, the song peaked at #23 on the UK Singles Chart and was a Top 20 hit in several other European countries. A different rendition, entitled ""Nutbush City Limits ('91)"", appeared alongside ""The 90s Version"". This funkier yet more laid-back arrangement is actually the one for which Turner recorded new vocals that were later remixed by producers Chris ""C. J."" Mackintosh and Dave Dorrell to become ""The 90s Version"". The 12"" single also featured an extended six-minute version of the dance remix, and a limited-release promotional DJ edition from the UK included still another take, ""A Little Bit o' Bush"". The corresponding music video for ""The 90s Version"" shows Turner recording the song in studio, intercut with footage of the various landmarks mentioned. 1993 re-recording. In 1993, Turner re-recorded the track as a re-working of the original studio arrangement for the ""What's Love Got to Do with It"" soundtrack album. Tina Turner Highway. Nutbush, an unincorporated town in Haywood County, Tennessee, located 75 miles (120.7 km) northeast of Memphis, is the childhood home of singer Tina Turner described in her 1973 song, ""Nutbush City Limits"". The town does not have ""city limits"" per se; however, ""Nutbush—Unincorporated"" signs are posted on the adjoining roads. Nutbush is located near the junction of Tennessee State Routes 180 and 19, the latter of which is referenced in the song as ""highway number nineteen"" (mistakenly called ""U.S. Route 19"" in Seger's version), with a noted speed limit of 25 mph (40 km/h) (""twenty-five was the speed limit""), which is currently 45 mph (72 km/h). In 2002, a nine-mile (14.5 km) segment of State Route 19 between Nutbush and Brownsville was officially designated ""Tina Turner Highway"" to honor the singer. The Nutbush. The Nutbush is a line dance performed to the song ""Nutbush City Limits"" that became popular in Australia during the disco era. "
wikipedia-3706044," Makara Jyothi  Makara () is the name of a zodiac sign in Indian languages known as Capricorn in English. ""Jyoti"" means ""light"" in Sanskrit. Thus ""Makara Jyoti"" (also spelt as Jyothi) means ""Light of Capricorn"". The Sun appears to move from one zodiac constellation to another every month and the day on which Sun changes the constellation is called Sankrānti (= transit) in Sanskrit. Makara Sankranti (, , , , ) is the Sun’s transit into Capricorn (Makara) constellation that usually occurs on 14 January every year and is a very important Hindu festival celebrated all over India in various forms. Uttarāyaṇa, the six-month period when the sun travels towards the north on the celestial sphere starts on Makara Sankranti and ends on Karka Sankranti (around July 14).  One of the places where a large number of devout Hindus reach on 14 January for worship is Sabarimala located in thick rain forests of Kerala.  Makara Jyothi is worshiped as a part of ritual in Sabarimala Temple on Makara Sankranti on 14 January every year. Devout Hindus believe that the ""jyothi"" is a celestial phenomenon and its sighting is auspicious and brings good luck and blessings. Popularity of the Ritual. Lord Sri Rama and his brother Lakshmana met Sabari, an ardent devotee, at Sabarimala. Sabari offered the Lord fruits after tasting them. But the Lord accepted them gladly and whole-heartedly. The Lord then turned and saw a divine person doing tapas. He asked Sabari who it was. Sabari said it was Sasta. Rama walked towards Sasta and the latter stood up to welcome the Prince of Ayodhya. The anniversary of this incident is celebrated on Makara Vilakku day. It is believed that on Makara Vilakku day, Lord Dharmasasta stops his tapas to bless his devotees. Another popular mythical belief is that the Makara Vilakku is lit there in commemoration of the aarathi performed by Dev rishis and Devas at the time of revelation of His Divine form (""Roopa"") by Manikantan (an incarnation of Sasta).  This event marks the culmination of the long and arduous pilgrimage to Sabarimala shrine. The light disappears in the evening after the ""Thiruvaabharanam"" (divine ornaments) are brought into the sanctum sanctorum and are placed on the Lord. The most significant rituals of worship are performed at the day of ""Makarajyoti"" (14 January every year). It draws the second largest number of pilgrims to a place of worship in India. Of particular significance is the fact that this is a remote forest in the Western Ghats in Kerala.  The most famous Ayyappa shrine in India is the one at Sabarimala with over 50 million devotees visiting it every year.. The huge crowd of pilgrims that witnesses the event has been on the rise every year. It is believed that 1.5 million devotees witnessed ""Makarajyoti"" light in 2010. The revenue collection during the Makaravilakku period was also higher compared to previous years. The total donations were Rs.720 million in 2008 against previous year’s Rs.723 million. Debate & Discussion. As per the direction of the Tantri Sri Kantharu Maheswararu, his grandson Rahul Easwar explained the difference between Makara Jyothi and Makara Vilakku. The former is the Makara star appearing above the hills and the latter is a man-made light appearing thrice on the hill next to the sanctum sanctorum. "
wikipedia-175488," Dombra  The dombra (домбыра or dombyra in Kazakh, dambura, dambura, in Uzbekistan, dumbyra in Tatar and Bashkir, tumbyra in Siberian Tatar, danbura in Hazaragi,) is a long-necked lute and a musical string instrument.  The instrument shares some of its characteristics with the komuz and dutar. Varieties. The instrument differs slightly in different regions. The Kazakh dombra has frets and is played by strumming with the hand or plucking each string individually, with an occasional tap on the main surface of the instrument. While the strings are traditionally made of sinew, modern dombras are usually produced using nylon strings. One of the greatest dombra players is Kazakh folk musician and composer Kurmangazy, which had a great influence on the development of the Kazakh musical culture, including - music for dombra, his musical composition ""Adai"" popular in Kazakhstan and abroad. In 2012 was created elektrodomra. The Turkestani and Badakhshani damburas are fretless with a body and neck carved from a single block of wood, usually mulberry or apricot. The dambura is played with much banging and scratching on the instrument to help give a percussive sound. The two strings are made of nylon (in modern times) or gut. They cross a short bridge to a pin at the other end of the body. There is a tiny sound hole in the back of the instrument, while the top is thick wood. It is not finished with any varnish, filing/sanding of any kind, and as with all other Afghan instruments there is some decoration. The Dumbura is the equivalent instrument of the Tatars and Bashkirs. A performer strikes all the strings at the same time. The upper string performs the bourdon tone and the lower string performs the melody. A dumbura is used as a solo as well as an ensemble instrument.  Dombra, ensemble and epic. The Kazakh poet Abay Qunanbayuli is often shown holding a dombra at rest and many hold it in high regard as a symbol of nationalism among the post-Soviet nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The dombra is played by Erzhan Alimbetov in the Ulytau band. From the 12th to the 18th century, the dumbura was used by Bashkir ""sasans"" to accompany their poetic legends and ""kubairs"". It is mentioned in the epic poem ""Zayatulyak and Hiuhiliu"". However, by the beginning of the 20th century, the dumbura was forgotten. The ""sasans"" were often the main ideologists of ethnic insurrections. So when the Russian administration put down an uprising, they punished the ""sasans"" and destroyed their dumburas. In the second half of the 20th century, several reconstructions were carried out. At present, the revivalist work continues. Among others, performer V. Shugayupov works on the revival of the dumbura. The modern wooden dumbura has a pear-shaped or an oval form. The dambura is popular particularly among the Hazara people. Safdar Tawakoli and Rajab Ali Haidari are notable Afghan dambura players. References in popular culture. This instrument has become a part of an Internet phenomenon after a video clip from SuperStar KZ, the Kazakh equivalent of the Idol series, was posted on YouTube. The video includes two contestants singing and a third one singing and playing the dombra (Ernar Kaldynov), which caused the popularity. The name of the original song is Freestailo by R.Lizer, a Kazakh man. Dombyra as an instrument is being popularized with mean of Dombyra Parties, a flash mob-like movement of Kazakh youth organized via social media. The videos of Dombyra Party activities are shared on Youtube, Facebook etc. External links. Kui on dombra Other links "
wikipedia-1497461," Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music  Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is a studio album by American recording artist Ray Charles, released in April 1962 on ABC-Paramount Records. Recording sessions for the album took place in early to mid-February 1962 at Capitol Studios in New York City and at United Recording Studios in Hollywood. Production was handled entirely by Charles and renowned conductor Sid Feller. A departure from Charles's previous work, the album features country, folk, and Western music standards covered and redone by Charles in popular song forms of the time, including rhythm and blues, pop, and jazz. As his fifth LP release for ABC-Paramount, ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" became a rapid critical and commercial success as it brought Ray Charles further mainstream notice, following his tenure for Atlantic Records. With the help of the album's four charting singles, Charles earned recognition in the pop market, as well as airplay on both R&B and country radio stations. ""Modern Sounds"" and its lead single, ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", were both certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1962, as each record had shipped 500,000 copies in the United States. Regarded by many critics as Charles's best studio album, ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" has been considered by several music writers to be a landmark album in American music. The album's integration of soul and country music bent racial barriers in popular music, amid the height of the African-American civil rights struggle. In the process of recording the album, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to exercise complete artistic control over his own recording career. The album has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as ""Rolling Stone"" and ""Time"". Background. After his Atlantic Records contract ended, Ray Charles signed with ABC-Paramount Records in November 1959, obtaining a much more generous contract than other artists had at the time. Following his commercial and pop crossover breakthrough with the hit single ""What'd I Say"" earlier that year, ABC offered Charles a $ 50,000 annual advance, higher royalties than previously offered and eventual ownership of his masters—a very valuable and lucrative deal at the time. Composed by Charles himself, the single furthered Charles's mainstream appeal, while becoming a Top 10 pop hit and selling a million copies in the United States, despite the ban placed on the record by some radio stations, in response to the song's sexually-suggestive lyrics. However, by the time of the release of the instrumental jazz LP ""Genius + Soul = Jazz"" (1960) for ABC's subsidiary label Impulse!, Charles had virtually given up on writing original material and had begun to follow his eclectic impulses as an interpreter. Charles' first hit single for ABC-Paramount was ""Georgia on My Mind"". Originally written by Stuart Gorrell and Hoagy Carmichael, Charles' version was produced by Sid Feller and released in 1960, earning Charles national acclaim and a Grammy Award. The song was Charles's first collaboration with Feller, who also arranged and conducted the recording. Charles earned another Grammy for the follow-up ""Hit the Road Jack"", written by R&B singer Percy Mayfield. By late 1961, Charles had expanded his small road ensemble to a full-scale big band, partly as a response to increasing royalties and touring fees, becoming one of the few black artists to crossover into mainstream pop with such a level of creative control. This success, however, came to a momentary halt in November 1961, as a police search of Charles's hotel room in Indianapolis, Indiana, during a concert tour led to the discovery of heroin in his medicine cabinet. The case was eventually dropped, as the search had been undertaken without a proper warrant, and Charles soon returned his focus on music and recording. Conception. Following his blues fusion with gospel and jazz influences on his earlier Atlantic material, which had brought him much fame and controversy, Charles sought to experiment with country music. As noted by himself in the liner notes for ""What'd I Say"" (1959), Charles was influenced by the genre in his youth, stating that he ""used to play piano in a hillbilly band"" and that he believed that he ""could do a good job with the right hillbilly song today."" At Atlantic, he attempted to incorporate this style and influence with his cover of country singer Hank Snow's ""I'm Movin' On"". Charles later said about the song, ""When I heard Hank Snow sing 'Moving On', I loved it. And the lyrics. Keep in mind, I’m a singer, so I like lyrics. Those lyrics are great, so that’s what made me want to do it."" The ""I'm Movin' On"" sessions were his last for Atlantic. Charles's recording of his acclaimed studio effort ""The Genius of Ray Charles"" (1959) brought him closer to expressing his jazz and pop crossover ambitions. Described by one music critic as ""the most important of his albums for Atlantic"", the record was the first to introduce Charles's musical approach of blending his brassy R&B sound with the more middle of the road, pop-oriented style, while performing in the presence of a big band ensemble. Recording of the album, as well his ABC-Paramount debut, ""The Genius Hits the Road"" (1960), a collection of place-name songs devoted to parts of the United States, expanded on Charles's thematic and conceptually-organized approach to albums rather than commercially successful singles production. Inspired by this approach and his recording of ""I'm Movin' On"", Charles originally made plans for a single-less concept album. When Charles had announced that he wanted to work on an album of country music in 1961, during a period of racial segregation and tension in the United States, he received generally negative commentary and feedback from his peers, including fellow R&B musicians and ABC-Paramount executives. The country album concept, however, meant more to Charles as a test of his record label's faith in him and respect for his artistic freedom than as a test of social tolerance among listeners amid racial distinctions of country and R&B. Fueled by his esteem for creative control, Charles pitched the idea of a country album to ABC representatives. Following the successful lobby of the concept and a contract renewal in early 1962, which was linked to the launching of his own Tangerine label, Charles prepared his band for the recording sessions that produced ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"". Recording. The recording sessions for ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" took place at three sessions in mid-February 1962. The first two sessions were set on February 5 and 7 at Capitol Studios in New York, New York, at which one half of the album was recorded and produced. The other half was recorded on February 15 of that same year at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Instead of drawing what he should record from memory and his knowledge of country music, Charles asked his newly appointed A&R (Artists and Repertoire) man and record producer Sid Feller to research top country standards through major country music publishers. By canvassing premier country publishing companies, such as Acuff-Rose Publishing (which featured the Hank Williams catalog) and Hill & Range Songs, most of which were located in Nashville, Tennessee, Feller amassed around 250 songs on tape for Charles to consider recording for ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"". From New York City, Feller sent the recordings to Charles, who was living in California at the time, for him to choose and later recalled the experience: While his selections provided the album's country and western foundation, the musical arrangements represented its contemporary influence. Eager to display his big band ensemble in studio, Charles enlisted premier jazz arrangers Gerald Wilson and Gil Fuller, while Marty Paich, who was active in the West Coast jazz scene, was hired to arrange the lush strings and chorus numbers. Despite enlisting a roster of professional arrangers and musicians, Charles intended to control the artistic direction of the recordings. To indicate specific licks he wanted emphasized for certain songs, Charles would put together voice-and-piano demos and pass them along to the arrangers, informing them of what he wanted to do with specific sounds. According to Feller, at one point during recording, Charles rewrote an entire botched arrangement and dictated the parts to each of the 18 backing musicians. ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" was his 18th overall LP release. According to Charles, the title of the album was conceived by producer Sid Feller and ABC-Paramount's executives and management people. Composition. The album's themes are about heartbreak and love, while most of the material chosen by Charles were ballads as well. The concept which had originally attracted the interest of Charles to this style of music was the strength he admired in writing such a ballad's somber or melancholy lyrics and then performing the ballad beautifully and with emotional stability; an element he had found to be common in even the most diverse musical genres. Writer Daniel Cooper said of Charles's adaptation of country elements, ""His country forays play like a series of intricate variations or like one long meditation on the expansive qualities of music commonly described as the white man's blues."" Allmusic's Stephen Cook writes that ""Charles intones the sleepy-blue nuances of country crooners while still giving the songs a needed kick with his gospel outbursts."" Despite the racial and social implications of R&B and country at the time, Charles did not agree with contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of ""Rolling Stone"", Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, ""he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant and I sat down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is."" In an interview with music historian Peter Guralnick, Charles further elaborated on his understanding, stating ""You take country music, you take black music, you got the same goddamn thing exactly."" While ""Modern Sounds"" features mostly covers of country and western music standards, its sound and musical style are marked by the heavy rhythm and blues influence of Charles's playing. A considerable amount of the material's melancholy lyrics and words are backed by piano and orchestral arrangements that are rooted in jazz, as well as West Coast and Charles's style of piano blues. Charles has said that the country album was ""completely different from rhythm and blues"". Songs. ""You Don't Know Me"" has a string and vocal ensemble production and themes of desirous unrequited love. The song's narrator longs for a woman that views him as ""just a friend/That's all I've ever been/For you don't know me."" Allmusic editor Bill Janovitz writes of the song's affecting narrative, stating ""The genius, the pathos, and the soul that is Charles oozes into this recording [...] No matter how many times one hears the song, it still induces chills down the spine after the narrator blows any chance he might have had and is left alone at the end."" Both composed by Hank Williams, ""You Win Again"" and ""Hey, Good Lookin'"" are derived from Williams's different emotional perspectives. The difference is further accentuated by Charles's interpretations of the songs. ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", a countrypolitan ballad with lush, cushioned arrangements, was placed at the 11th spot in the track listing, assumed by Sid Feller to be the album's weakest song, after which becoming the album's top-selling single. Charles was disappointed with him, as Feller was in charge of sequencing for the album. A component of ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" is Charles's creative reliance on honky tonk musician Floyd Tillman's songwriting, covering the heartbreak ballads ""It Makes No Difference Now"" and ""I Love You So Much It Hurts"". The Ted Daffan-penned ""Worried Mind"" and ""Born to Lose"" expand his take on country balladry and feature a blend of piano blues with string arrangements. Commercial performance. ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" became one of the best-selling albums recorded by a black musician of the time, as well as one of the best-selling country albums, shipping at least 500,000 copies in its first three months of release. This achievement was due in part to the mainstream promotional efforts ""Modern Sounds"" had received from ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R&B and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period. Upon the album's release in early April 1962 in both mono and stereo format, a reviewer for ""Billboard"" magazine claimed that ""In addition to being powerful dealer material, this package will fracture knowledgeable jockeys who will find in it a wealth of material to talk about as well as play."" By mid-April, reports of the album's sales and radio airplay had started coming in from cities such as Dallas and Philadelphia. On June 23, 1962, the mono issue of ""Modern Sounds"" replaced the ""West Side Story"" soundtrack album as the number one album in the United States, knocking it off the top of the ""Billboard"" Pop Albums chart. The album spawned four charting singles, ""Born to Lose"", ""Careless Love"", ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" and ""You Don't Know Me"", the latter two of which went number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. The hit singles quickly gained a significant amount of radio airplay on both country and R&B stations. By mid-May, the album's lead single, ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", had sold 700,000 copies within its first four weeks of release. Record dealers began describing the album as ""equal in sales action to some of the early Presley disks"" and, after moving 400,000 copies of the single, influential Atlanta record distributor Gwen Kestler told ""Billboard"" magazine that ""the record is so hot in her district that people who don't even own record players are buying it."" ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" hit number one on the ""Billboard"" Pop Singles chart on June 2, spending five consecutive weeks at the top of the chart. By the time it fell off the top, the single was reported to have reached nearly a million-and-a-half sales, moving over 100,000 copies per week. As ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" and its singles were performing well in the United States, Charles toured Europe with his big band and the Raelettes. He performed both his signature R&B and jazz material at such venues as Paris Olympia and the Hot Club de France, where he was hailed as ""a true jazz artist in the tradition of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington."" Upon his return to the United States at the end of the summer, ABC-Paramount had officially recognized his achievements, presenting Charles with two gold records—one for ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", the other for his ""Modern Sounds"" album—during a live concert performance at the Convention Hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Through his ventures into country music and the European jazz scene, Charles's white audience grew significantly at concerts. The album was quickly followed by another recording of country, western and pop standards covered by Charles, and recorded in September 1962. ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2"" was released six months after the first volume and proved to be equally successful, while also earning a gold certification by the following year. Following his tenure with ABC-Paramount, Charles later went on to achieve more commercial success recording country music under Warner Bros. Records throughout most of the 1970s and 1980s. Critical reception. Upon its release, ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" received positive reviews from music critics of both rhythm and blues and country music. ""Billboard"" called it ""one of the most intriguing albums in a long time"" and found its concept ""wonderful"". ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" subsequently earned Charles a Grammy Award for Best Rhythm & Blues Recording at the 1963 Grammy Awards, while the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Since its initial reception, the album has been praised by critics for Charles's style and manner of interpreting country music into his R&B musical language. Robert Hilburn of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote that the ""masterful interpretation of several country standards ... opened a lot of pop ears to country music and showed Nashville much about the proper use of orchestration."" Allmusic editor Stephen Cook called the album a ""fine store of inimitable interpretations"", and stated, ""Less modern for its country-R&B blend and lushly produced C&W tone than for its place as a high-profile crossover hit, ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western"" fit right in with Ray Charles's expansive musical ways while on the Atlantic label in the '50s"". Chris Neal of ""Country Weekly"" commented that Charles ""recast 12 country favorites in big-band and orchestrated settings with a visionary’s easy grace"", adding that he ""gets to the heart of each in a way that remains thoroughly modern."" John Morthland of the ""Oxford American"" called it a ""landmark LP of transcendent vocals set against kitschy orchestrations that (along with early rock 'n' roll) illuminated black-white roots connections for a popular audience."" Accolades. In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, as was ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" in 2001. ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" was cited by The Recording Academy as a recording of ""historical significance"". ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" was ranked number 49 on Country Music Television's list of the 100 Greatest Songs of Country Music. In November 2003, ""Rolling Stone"" ranked the album number 104 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, one of Charles's two entries and his highest ranking on the list; it is accompanied only by his ""The Genius of Ray Charles"" at number 263. Legacy and influence. Country music. In the wake of ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" and its success, country music experienced an immediate increase in popularity. According to music writer Daniel Cooper, ""the album raised the genre's profile"", specifically Nashville sound, which Charles had covered. Benefiting from this were songwriters, music publishers, and country singers who covered the subgenre's material. As noted by Cooper, by the end of 1962, Nashville country publishers were being held as ""the hottest source of music material in the record business these days."" Charles's success with the stylistic fusion of country and soul on ""Modern Sounds"" led to similar efforts from artists such as Candi Staton and Solomon Burke, who were greatly influenced by the album. Many country music artists such as Willie Nelson and Buck Owens have cited Charles's take on the genre with the album as a major influence. In an interview for ""Country Music Television"", Nelson said that the album ""did more for country music than any one artist has ever done."" Doug Freeman of the ""Austin Chronicle"" wrote of Charles's influence through the album, stating: Summing up on the impact ""Modern Sounds"" had on country music and listeners, writer Daniel Cooper states, ""There is no telling how many people, who perhaps never paid much attention to country music or even had professed to dislike it, listened anew based on the impact of having heard what Ray Charles was capable of doing with that music."" Charles eventually earned a country music repertoire and reputation following the success of the ""Modern Sounds"" records, later country hit singles for Warner Bros. Records, and various appearances at country music events, including The Johnny Cash Show in 1970 and the Grand Ole Opry's 58th anniversary in 1983, the program to which he listened to as a youth. Social impact. Following the album's release, Charles quickly earned an influx of white listeners and audiences at concert venues, without experiencing any fall-out from his predominantly black audience. Writer Daniel Cooper later said of the album's effect, ""It's an idea as corny as any country song you can think of, and one that Charles knew to be true; music unites people. It just really does."" Throughout the years following its initial reception, ""Modern Sounds"" gained further acknowledgment of its impact on the music industry and society. Through conceiving and recording the album, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to receive and practice artistic control bestowed upon by a mainstream record company. In a 1998 interview, country musician Raul Malo acknowledged the album's influence, calling it ""one of the most important records of our time, not only because of its content, but also due to its social and political ramifications."" In a July 8, 2004 article for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, music journalist Robert Christgau praised the impact and influence that the ""Modern Sounds"" recordings had on music, stating ""In the world it created, not only could a black person sing the American songbook Ella Fitzgerald owned by then, but a country black person could take it over. Soon Charles's down-home diction, cotton-field grit, corn-pone humor and overstated shows of emotion were standard operating procedure in American music, black and white."" In addition to its social implications, the musical integration of soul and country into popular format by Charles changed and revolutionized racial boundaries and restraints in music, and contributed to the historical Civil Rights Movement. Robert Fontenot of About.com was one of several writers to praise the album's musical and social implications, stating ""Arguably one of the most brilliant interpretive albums ever released, it did more to integrate modern American music than almost any other LP in history."" In paying tribute to the magazine's selection of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, which had selected Charles at #2, singer-songwriter Billy Joel noted the album's racial and social impact in an article for ""Rolling Stone"", stating ""here is a black man giving you the whitest possible music in the blackest possible way, while all hell is breaking loose with the civil rights movement."" Another article for ""Rolling Stone"", written in honor of Charles and his achievements, later stated that through his ""Modern Sounds"" recordings, Ray Charles ""made it acceptable for black people to sing country & western music, in the process doing almost as much to break down racial barriers as did the civil-rights movement."" Subsequent work by Charles. In addition to the album's legacy as one of the most influential recordings of all time, ""Modern Sounds"" also had an effect on Charles's later work. According to writer Nate Guidry, the recording marked the zenith of Charles's popularity and success. By the mid-1960s and continuing into the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of his musical output was focused onto more middle of the road and pop releases, featuring less of his recognizable, trademark soul and R&B, and more of the crossover and fusion tendencies of ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"". On the album's influence, columnist Spencer Leigh of ""The Independent"" stated that ""Numerous artists followed Charles's lead, but it must be said that Charles himself repeated the trick much too often."" The period of releases following ""Modern Sounds"", which includes the musician's later recording years as well, has been recognized by music writers and critics as a ""critical slide"" and the weakest in his recording career. Several of the LP albums from this period have yet to be reissued and have remained rare among record collectors, if not out of print. Charles's final studio album ""Genius Loves Company"" (2004) would later be released shortly after his death, and proved to be a comeback success, in terms of sales and critical response, as it quickly became Charles's first top-10 album in forty years and the best-selling record of his career. On October 27, 1998, Rhino Entertainment issued a four-disc box set entitled ""The Complete Country & Western Recordings: 1959–1986"", which chronicles Charles's country and western recordings. The collection features the two volumes of ""Modern Sounds"", as well as his later country singles for Warner Bros. Included in the set is a hardcover booklet of essays by producer Sid Feller, writer Daniel Cooper, and Ray Charles, along with liner photography by Howard Morehead and Les Leverett. On June 2, 2009, both volumes of ""Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music"" were reissued as a single package by Concord Music. The reissue was also included as a download in the iTunes Store. Track listing. All tracks were produced by Ray Charles and Sid Feller. The album was later reissued on compact disc by the specialty record label Rhino Entertainment in October 1988 with three bonus tracks. "

It is long with 71 km of dedicated high-speed tracks and 17 km of modernised lines. Service began on 14 December 1997. The line has appreciably shortened journey times, the journey from Paris to Brussels now taking 1:22. In combination with the LGV Nord, it has also impacted international journeys to other cities in France and to London, ensuring high-speed through-running by Eurostar, TGV, Thalys PBA and Thalys PBKA trainsets. The total construction cost was €1.42 billion. The signalling system installed is the TVM-430 in-cab signalling system, the same as LGV Nord in France, and High Speed 1 in the UK. Route. Trains leave Brussels-Midi station via a new viaduct completed in 2006 to separate high-speed services from local services. From there they parallel the traditional lines. At Forest/Vorst the train passes the depot where inspections of Thalys and Eurostar trains may be carried out. At Halle (km 13) the HST enters its own cut-and-cover section before crossing the Brussels-Charleroi Canal; at km 17 the high speed line proper begins at the Lembeek Viaduct, supporting 300 km/h speeds. Between Rebecq and Enghien the line parallels the A8 autoroute, separated by a security fence. At Enghien the line parallels the regular Brussels-Tournai line for approximately 10 km.  The maintenance depot ""Le Coucou"" is located near Ath. This station served as the operations base during the construction of the line (from 1993 to 1998) and currently serves as the maintenance depot for HSL 1. Slightly further on is the 2005 m long Arbre Viaduct (one of the longest rail viaducts in Europe) between Ath and Chièvres; it passes over the Ath-Blaton canal, the Dender River, the Mons road and the Ath-Jurbise railway. At Antoing there is a connector to the Mons-Tournai line, used by the Thalys between Paris and Namur. After passing over the 483m Scheldt River Viaduct, and through the 365m Bruyelle cut-and-cover section, the line crosses the Belgian-French border at Wannehain, km 88. 11 km further on, the Frétin triangle splits the LGV Nord towards Paris or Lille.

wikipedia-561200," Osvaldo Golijov  Osvaldo Noé Golijov () (born December 5, 1960) is an Argentine composer of classical music. Life and career. Osvaldo Golijov was born in and grew up in La Plata, Argentina, in a Jewish family that had emigrated to Argentina in the 1920s from Romania and Russia. Golijov's mother was a piano teacher, his father, a physician. He was raised ""surrounded by chamber classical music, Jewish liturgical and klezmer music, and the new tango of Ástor Piazzolla,"" according to his official website. He studied piano at the local conservatory in La Plata and studied composition with Gerardo Gandini. In 1983, Golijov moved to Israel, where he studied with Mark Kopytman at the Jerusalem Rubin Academy. Three years later, he moved to the United States. There he studied with composer George Crumb at the University of Pennsylvania before receiving his doctorate. Golijov is the recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship and the Vilcek Prize, among other awards and commissions. He collaborates closely with conductor Miguel Harth-Bedoya; vocalists Luciana Souza and Biella de Costa; cellists Yo-Yo Ma, Alisa Weilerstein, Maya Beiser and Matt Haimovitz; the kamancheh virtuoso Kayhan Kalhor and percussionist Jamey Haddad; ensembles including the Atlanta Symphony, the Boston Symphony, the Chicago Symphony, Silk Road Ensemble and eighth blackbird; the artist Gronk, playwright David Henry Hwang, and directors Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Sellars. He has been composer-in-residence at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Merkin Hall in New York, the Spoleto Festival USA, the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Music Alive series, Marlboro Music School and Festival, Ravinia Festival, and several other festivals. In 2010, he composed a commissioned work for 35 American orchestras titled ""Sidereus"", honoring the seventeenth century Italian astronomer Galileo. and dedicated to an orchestra industry official, Henry Fogel. For the 2012-13 season, Golijov held the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair at Carnegie Hall in New York. Golijov is Loyola Professor of Music at the College of the Holy Cross at Worcester, Massachusetts, where he has taught since 1991.  He married architect and designer Neri Oxman in 2011. He has three children from a previous marriage. Golijov's music. Golijov has developed a rich musical language, the result of a lifetime of experience with various types of music. His Romanian Jewish parents exposed him to the traditional Klezmer music and liturgical music of their faith. Growing up and going to public school in Argentina showed him the many musical styles of his family's adopted country, including the tango. Once Golijov traveled abroad to continue his studies, the influences of other people and other styles became part of him. What is considered so remarkable about his musical language is that, rather than a pastiche of styles, it is wholly cohesive. It is thought of as vibrant and alive, growing and changing as he does. Golijov and composers Sofia Gubaidulina, Tan Dun, and Wolfgang Rihm were commissioned by the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart to write pieces for the Passion 2000 project in commemoration of Johann Sebastian Bach. Golijov's contribution was ""La Pasión según San Marcos"" (The Passion according to St. Mark). He has also composed and arranged works for the Kronos Quartet and the St. Lawrence String Quartet. He frequently works with Venezuelan conductor María Guinand, who conducted the world premieres of Oceana (commissioned by the Oregon Bach Festival, 1996) and ""La Pasión según San Marcos"" (Stuttgart's European Music Festival, 2000); classical and Klezmer clarinetist David Krakauer; and American soprano Dawn Upshaw, who performed premieres of his new opera, ""Ainadamar"" (and Arias and Ensembles derived from it) at Tanglewood with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (which commissioned the opera) in 2003, the Santa Fe Opera Festival in 2005, London's Barbican Arts Centre in 2006 and Opera Boston in 2007. Upshaw also performed the premiere of Golijov's song cycle ""Ayre"" in 2004 at New York's Zankel Hall. ""Azul"", a work for cello and orchestra, was written for Yo-Yo Ma, who premiered the work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 2006. Golijov's first movie soundtrack experience was for Sally Potter's 2000 film ""The Man Who Cried"". More recently he composed for Francis Ford Coppola's movie ""Youth Without Youth"", and original music for Coppola's films ""Tetro"" and ""Twixt"". His music has been played during a performance of the New Jersey-based Lydia Johnson Dance company. Ainadamar (2003, revised 2005): Golijov's first opera, ""Ainadamar"" (""Fountain of Tears""), received its premiere in Tanglewood in 2003; the revised, current version, premiered at the Santa Fe Opera in 2005. ""Ainadamar"" — subtitled An Opera in Three Images — explores the life and death of playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, through the lens of his relationship with actress Margarita Xirgu and his play ""Maria Pineda"". The opera has been produced worldwide, including New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Madrid, Granada, Darmstadt, Adelaide, London, and Bogata, among others. 2013 sees the opera's Japanese premiere, as well as its third production in Spain. A 2006 recording for Deutsche Grammophon received Grammy awards for both Best Opera Recording and Best Classical Contemporary Composition. Ayre (2004): ""Ayre"", a song cycle for soprano and ensemble, received its premiere in 2004 at New York's Zankel Hall, performed by Dawn Upshaw and The Andalucian Dogs. The work, commissioned by Carnegie Hall, was conceived as a companion piece to Luciano Berio's ""Folk Songs"", which shared the program at the premiere. Just as Berio sought to honor the artistry and versatility of Cathy Berberian in his songs, Golijov and Carnegie agreed that ""Ayre"" should honor the artistry, love for folk music and versatility of Dawn Upshaw. Both works reimagine folk melodies and also ""folk-like"" pieces by other composers. Specifically, ""Ayre's"" texts and some melodies are based on Sephardic and Arabic folk songs, 12th-century liturgical poetry of Yehuda Halevi, a modern poem by Mahmoud Darwish, and two pieces by Gustavo Santaolalla. As an additional homage to the Berio work, Golijov uses the same instruments as Folk Songs: flute, clarinet, harp, viola, cello, and percussion, to which he adds horn, double bass, accordion, guitar/ronroco, and laptop. Ayre was recorded and released on a 2005 Deutsche Grammophon CD, resulting in a Grammy nomination for Best Classical Contemporary Composition. Additionally, the recording was included on numerous ""Best of the Year"" lists, including those of The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and San Jose Mercury News. Azul (2006): ""Azul"", for cello and orchestra, was commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and written for cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who premiered the work at Tanglewood in 2006. In addition to the cello soloist, the orchestra is joined by a featured obligatto group of hyperaccordion and ethnic percussion. As with many of his works, Golijov subsequently revised the work, leading up to its New York premiere in the opening concert of the Mostly Mozart Festival of 2007, with Alisa Weilerstein as the soloist. Since then the work has been championed by both Weilerstein and Ma and various major orchestras. Azul was featured on the New York Philharmonic's 2013 season opening gala concert, which was filmed will be televised nationally in the United States on December 31, 2013. The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind (1994): ""The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind"", written for klezmer clarinet and string quartet (and subsequently offered in a version for clarinet and string orchestra) is inspired by the writings and teachings of Rabbi Yitzhak Saggi Nehor — also known as Issac the Blind — who lived in twelfth and thirteenth century Provence. The 33-minute work is presented in three movements, each stylistically inspired by one of the three main historical Jewish languages — Aramaic, Yiddish, and Hebrew — plus a prelude and postlude. The third, ""Hebrew"" movement is in fact an instrumental setting of a vocal work, ""K'vakarat"" (also 1994) that Golijov composed for cantor and string quartet using the text of a prayer from Yom Kippur. ""The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind"" been recorded by the Kronos Quartet with David Krakauer (1997), and the St. Lawrence String Quartet with Todd Palmer (2002). La Pasión según San Marcos (2000): ""La Pasión según San Marcos"", Golijov's interpretation of the Gospel According to St. Mark, was commissioned by the International Bach Academy and its director, Helmuth Rilling, as part of their observation of the 250th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach. The work received its premiere in Stuttgart on September 5, 2000, where is received a 25-minute standing ovation and was widely hailed by critics as establishing a new voice for classical music at the dawn of the 21st century. Following Bach's tradition, Golijov adds interpolated texts that serve to frame and interpret the original words of St. Mark (sung in Spanish) describing the last days of Jesus's life. Specifically, he includes selected texts from the Hebrew Kaddish, the Lamentations of Jeremiah, Psalms 113-119, and the poetry of Rosalia de Castro. Musically, he tells the story through a range of Latin musical idioms, including Cuban, Brazilian, and Flamenco. Since its premiere, the work has been presented in cities including Boston (2001 and 2014), Sidney (2002), Miami (2007), New York (2002, 2006, 2007 and 2013), Rome (2008), Milan (2008), Amsterdam (2008), and Los Angeles (2010). It has been recorded by Hänssler Classics (2001) and Deutsche Grammophon (2010). Deadline and plagiarism controversy. Golijov has been the nexus of several controversies around his work, including missed deadlines and accusations of plagiarism.  Golijov came under scrutiny in 2011 for a series of high-profile commissions that were either delayed or cancelled. A violin concerto written for the Los Angeles Philharmonic was not completed in time, and had to be replaced on the program. A second deadline was missed the following year in Berlin. The piece was delayed a third time in November 2012, and missed its January 2013 premiere at Disney Hall. This followed a similar cancellation in 2010, when a scheduled song cycle had to be removed from the program when it was not complete in time. The March 2011 premiere of a new string quartet for the St. Lawrence Quartet was also delayed due to a missed deadline, though the work, ""Qohelet,"" was completed later that year and premiered by the quartet in October 2011. Questions of musical plagiarism were leveled at Golijov after Tom Manoff, a composer and critic, and Brian McWhorter, a trumpeter, alleged that ""Sidereus"" consists mainly of music from the Michael Ward-Bergeman composition ""Barbeich."" Alex Ross of ""The New Yorker"" reviewed both scores and wrote, ""To put it bluntly, 'Sidereus' is 'Barbeich' with additional material attached,"" yet Ross adds that Ward-Bergeman was aware of Golijov's borrowings. A consortium of thirty-five orchestras paid Golijov $75,000 to write a 20-minute work; a fee supplemented by a $50,000 grant approved by the then board of the League of American Orchestras. The final work that Golijov produced and gave to the consortium of orchestras is a 9-minute work. Golijov also used that same musical material in his 2009 composition ""Radio."" Golijov responded to these questions by explaining that he composed the original musical material jointly with Ward-Bergeman, and used it with permission. He also cited Claudio Monteverdi, Franz Schubert and Gustav Mahler as other composers who have shared existing musical material to create new music. "

wikipedia-10576," Francis Ford Coppola  Francis Ford Coppola (; (born April 7, 1939) is an American film director, producer and screenwriter.  In 1970, he won the Oscar for best original screenplay as co-writer, with Edmund H. North, of ""Patton"" (1970). His directorial prominence was cemented with the release in 1972 of ""The Godfather, ""a film which revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre , earning praise from both critics and the public before winning three Academy Awards—including his second Oscar (Best Adapted Screenplay, with Mario Puzo), Best Picture, and his first nomination for Best Director. He followed with ""The Godfather Part II"" in 1974, which became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, it brought him three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture, and made him the second director, after Billy Wilder, to be honored three times for the same film. ""The Conversation"", which he directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. He next directed 1979's ""Apocalypse Now"". Notorious for its over-long and strenuous production, the film was nonetheless critically acclaimed for its vivid and stark depiction of the Vietnam War, winning the Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival. Coppola is one of only eight filmmakers to win two Palme d'Or awards. While a number of Coppola's ventures in the 1980s and 1990s were critically lauded, he has never quite achieved the same commercial success with films as in the 1970s. Early life. Coppola was born in Detroit, Michigan, to father Carmine Coppola, a flautist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and mother Italia (née Pennino). Coppola is the second of three children: his older brother was August Coppola, his younger sister is actress Talia Shire. Born into a family of Italian immigrant ancestry, his paternal grandparents came to the United States from Bernalda, Basilicata. Coppola received his middle name in honor of Henry Ford, not only because he was born in the Henry Ford Hospital but because of his musician-father's association with the automobile manufacturer. At the time of Coppola's birth, his father was a flautist as well as arranger and assistant orchestra director for ""The Ford Sunday Evening Hour"", an hour-long concert music radio series sponsored by the Ford Motor Company. Two years after Coppola's birth, his father was named principal flautist for the NBC Symphony Orchestra and the family moved to New York, settling in Woodside, Queens, where Coppola spent the remainder of his childhood. Contracting polio as a boy, Coppola was bedridden for large periods of his childhood, allowing him to indulge his imagination with homemade puppet theater productions. Reading ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" at age 15 was instrumental in developing his interest in theater. Eager to be involved in film-craft, he created 8mm features edited from home movies with such titles as ""The Rich Millionaire"" and ""The Lost Wallet."" As a child, Coppola was a mediocre student, but he was so much interested in technology and engineering that his friends nicknamed him ""Science"". Trained initially for a career in music, he became proficient on the tuba and won a music scholarship to the New York Military Academy. Overall, Coppola attended 23 other schools before he eventually graduated from the Great Neck North High School. He entered Hofstra University in 1955 with a major in theater arts. There he was awarded a scholarship in playwriting. This furthered his interest in directing theater despite the disapproval of his father, who wanted him to study engineering. Coppola was profoundly impressed after seeing Sergei Eisenstein’s """", especially with the movie's quality of editing. It was at this time Coppola decided he would go into cinema rather than theater. Coppola says he was tremendously influenced to become a writer early on by his brother, August, in whose footsteps he would also follow by attending both of his brother's alma matres: Hofstra and UCLA. Coppola also gives credit to the work of Elia Kazan and for its influence on him as a director. Amongst Coppola's classmates at Hofstra were James Caan, Lainie Kazan and radio artist Joe Frank. He later cast Caan in ""The Rain People"" and ""The Godfather"". While pursuing his bachelor's degree, Coppola was elected president of The Green Wig (the university's drama group) and the Kaleidoscopians (its musical comedy club). He then merged the two into The Spectrum Players and under his leadership, they staged a new production each week. Coppola also founded the cinema workshop at Hofstra and contributed prolifically to the campus literary magazine. He won three D. H. Lawrence Awards for theatrical production and direction and received a Beckerman Award for his outstanding contributions to the school's theater arts division. While a graduate student, one of his teachers was Dorothy Arzner, whose encouragement Coppola later acknowledged as pivotal to his film career. Coppola graduated from Hofstra university in 1959 with a bachelor's degree in Theatre Arts. Career. 1960s. Coppola enrolled in UCLA Film School for graduate work in film. There he directed a short horror film called ""The Two Christophers"" inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's William Wilson, and ""Ayamonn the Terrible"", a film about a sculptor’s nightmares coming to life, before directing the experimental softcore comedy, ""Tonight for Sure,"" in 1962. They failed to attract any attention.  At UCLA, Coppola met Jim Morrison. He later used Morrison's song ""The End"" in ""Apocalypse Now"". The company that hired him for ""Tonight for Sure"" brought him back to re-cut a German film titled ""Mit Eva fing die Sünde an"" directed by Fritz Umgelter. He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer’s and director’s credit for ""The Bellboy and the Playgirls"", also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by Roger Corman and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film ""Nebo zovyot"", which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled ""Battle Beyond the Sun"", released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on ""Tower of London"" (1962), sound man for ""The Young Racers"" (1963) and associate producer of ""The Terror"" (1963). While on location in Ireland for ""The Young Racers"" in 1963, Corman, ever alert for an opportunity to produce a decent movie on a shoestring budget, persuaded Coppola to make a low-budget horror movie with funds left over from the movie. Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night, incorporating elements from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and the result impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights), Coppola directed in a period of nine days ""Dementia 13"", his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a cult film among horror buffs. It was on the sets of ""Dementia 13"" that he met his future wife Eleanor Jessie Neil. In 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (""Pilma, Pilma"") written by a UCLA student. This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with Seven Arts. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for ""This Property Is Condemned"" (1966) and ""Is Paris Burning?"" (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the David Benedictus novel ""You're a Big Boy Now"" and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in ""You're a Big Boy Now"" (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via Warner Bros. This movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually his Master of Fine Arts Degree from UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in 1967. Following the success of ""You're a Big Boy Now"", Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical ""Finian's Rainbow"", starring Petula Clark in her first American film and veteran Fred Astaire. Producer Jack Warner was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, ""hippie"" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the Napa Valley for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, but his work with Clark no doubt contributed to her Golden Globe Best Actress nomination. The film introduced George Lucas to him, who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ""The Rain People"" in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie. The film won the Golden Shell at the 1969 San Sebastian Film Festival. In 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio ""Zoetrope"" after receiving a gift of zoetropes from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture making equipment. While touring Europe, Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in Marin County to house the studio. However in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for Zoetrope Studio became a warehouse in San Francisco on Folsom Street. The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of HDTV. In his book ""The American Cinema"", Andrew Sarris wrote, ""is probably the first reasonably talented and sensibly adaptable directorial talent to emerge from a university curriculum in film-making... [He may be heard from more decisively in the future."" 1970s. Coppola epitomized a group of filmmakers known as the ""New Hollywood"" that emerged in the early 1970s with ideas that challenged conventional film-making. The group included Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Terrence Malick, Robert Altman, Woody Allen, William Friedkin, Philip Kaufman and George Lucas. ""Patton"" (1970). Coppola co-wrote the script for ""Patton"" in 1970 along with Edmund H. North. This earned him his first Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince Franklin J. Schaffner that the opening scene would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview: Even after the director was persuaded to keep the scene intact, George C. Scott refused to do it, as he believed it would overshadow the rest of his performance. The director lied and assured him that it would be shown at the end. The movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military ""Pep Talk"" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge American flag. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an R rating; in the opening monologue, the word ""fornicating"" replaced ""fucking"" when criticizing the ""The Saturday Evening Post"". Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows. ""The Godfather"" (1972). The release of ""The Godfather"" in 1972 was a milestone in cinema. The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the Corleone family, received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, which he shared with Mario Puzo and two Golden Globe Awards: for Best Director and Best Screenplay. However, Coppola had to face a lot of difficulties while filming ""The Godfather"". He was not Paramount's first choice to direct the movie; Italian director Sergio Leone was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ""Once Upon a Time in America"". Peter Bogdanovich was then approached but he also declined the offer and made ""What's Up, Doc?"" instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast Edward G. Robinson in the lead had he accepted the film. According to Robert Evans, head of Paramount Pictures at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his Sicilian and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, ""smell the spaghetti"". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm. There was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, though Paramount wanted either Ernest Borgnine or Danny Thomas. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that ""Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture"". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets). Coppola chose Brando over Ernest Borgnine on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an Academy Award for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect: After it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Casablanca"" on the initial AFI's 100 Years…100 Movies list by the American Film Institute. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008. Director Stanley Kubrick believed that ""The Godfather"" was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast. ""The Conversation"" (1974). Coppola's next film, ""The Conversation"", further cemented his position as one of the most talented auteurs of Hollywood. The movie was partly influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni’s ""Blowup"" (1966) and generated a lot of speculation and interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the Nixon administration used to spy on political opponents prior to the Watergate scandal. Although Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental, for not only was the script for ""The Conversation"" completed in the mid-1960s (before the election of Richard Nixon), but the spying equipment used in the film was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out. The movie was a critical success and won Coppola his first Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. ""The Great Gatsby"" (1974). During the filming of ""The Conversation"", Coppola wrote the screenplay for ""The Great Gatsby"". However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ""The Godfather"" Coppola states, ""I don't think that script was made."" ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974). Coppola shot ""The Godfather Part II"" parallel to ""The Conversation"" and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in Technicolor. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: ""You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work"", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young Vito Corleone and the other of his son Michael. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use ""Part II"" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ""The Godfather Part II"". According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ""The Godfather"", there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ""The Godfather Part II"" began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director. ""The Godfather Part II"" is ranked as the #1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's ""50 Best Movies of All Time"" and is ranked at #7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the ""100 Greatest Movies of All Time"". The film is also featured on movie critic Leonard Maltin's list of the ""100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century"", as well as Roger Ebert's ""Great Movies"" list. It was also featured on Sight & Sound's list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at #4. Coppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. Victor Fleming was the first in 1939 with ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz""; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with ""Foreign Correspondent"" and ""Rebecca"". Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: Herbert Ross in 1977 with ""The Goodbye Girl"" and ""The Turning Point"", and Steven Soderbergh in 2000 with ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic"". Coppola, however, is the only one to have produced the pictures. ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). Following the success of ""The Godfather"", ""The Conversation"" and ""The Godfather Part II"", Coppola began filming ""Apocalypse Now"", an adaptation of Conrad’s ""Heart of Darkness"" set in Cambodia during the Vietnam War (Coppola himself briefly appears as a TV news director). Before production of the film began, Coppola went to his mentor Roger Corman for advice about shooting in the Philippines, since Corman had filmed several pictures there. Coppola said that all the advice Corman offered was ""Don't go"". The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including typhoons, nervous breakdowns, the firing of Harvey Keitel, Martin Sheen's heart attack, extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels and an unprepared Brando with a bloated appearance (which Coppola attempted to hide by shooting him in the shadows). It was delayed so often it was nicknamed ""Apocalypse When?"" The 1991 documentary film """", directed by Eleanor Coppola (Francis's wife), Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper, chronicles the difficulties the crew went through making ""Apocalypse Now"" and features behind-the-scenes footage filmed by Eleanor. After filming ""Apocalypse Now"", Coppola famously stated: ""We were in the jungle, there were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment and little by little, we went insane."" The film was overwhelmingly lauded by critics when it finally appeared in 1979 and was selected for the 1979 Cannes Film Festival, winning the Palme d'Or along with ""The Tin Drum"", directed by Volker Schlöndorff. When the film screened at Cannes, he quipped: ""My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam."" ""Apocalypse Now""'s reputation has grown in time and it is now regarded by many as a masterpiece of the New Hollywood era and is frequently cited as one of the greatest movies ever made. Roger Ebert considers it to be the finest film on the Vietnam war and included it on his list for the 2002 Sight & Sound poll for the greatest movie of all time. In 2001, Coppola re-released ""Apocalypse Now"" as ""Apocalypse Now Redux"", restoring several sequences lost from the original 1979 cut of the film, thereby expanding its length to 200 minutes. 1980s. ""One from the Heart"" (1982). ""Apocalypse Now"" marked the end of the golden phase of Coppola's career. His musical fantasy ""One from the Heart"", although pioneering the use of video-editing techniques which are standard practice in the film industry today, ended with a disastrous box-office gross of $636,796 against a US$26 million budget, far from enough to recoup the costs incurred in the production of the movie and he was forced to sell his 23-acre Zoetrope Studio in 1983. He would spend the rest of the decade working to pay off his debts. (Zoetrope Studios finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1990, after which its name was changed to American Zoetrope). In addition Coppola himself was forced into US bankruptcy court three times over the next 8 years. ""Hammett"" (1982). Following the disastrous ""One from the Heart"", Coppola co-directed ""Hammett"" along with Wim Wenders in the same year. Although Coppola was not credited for his effort, according to one source, ""by the time the final version was released in 1982, only 30 percent of Wenders' footage remained and the rest was completely reshot by Coppola, whose mere 'executive producer' credit is just a technicality."" ""The Outsiders"" (1983). In 1983, he directed ""The Outsiders"", a film adaptation of the novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton. Coppola credited his inspiration for making the film to a suggestion from middle school students who had read the novel. ""The Outsiders"" is notable for being the breakout film for a number of young actors who would go on to become major stars. These included major roles for Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio and C. Thomas Howell. Also in the cast were Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane and Tom Cruise. Matt Dillon and several others also starred in Coppola's related film, ""Rumble Fish"", which was also based on a S. E. Hinton novel and filmed at the same time as ""The Outsiders"" on-location in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Carmine Coppola wrote and edited the musical score, including the title song ""Stay Gold"", which was based upon a famous Robert Frost poem and performed for the movie by Stevie Wonder. The film was a moderate box-office success, drawing a revenue of $25 million against a budget of $10 million. ""Rumble Fish"" (1983). ""Rumble Fish"" was based on the novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton, who also co-wrote the screenplay. Shot in black-and-white as an homage to German expressionist films, ""Rumble Fish"" centres on the relationship between a revered former gang leader (Mickey Rourke) and his younger brother, Rusty James (Matt Dillon). The film bombed at the box office, earning a meagre $2.5 million against a budget of $10 million and once again aggravated Coppola's financial troubles. ""The Cotton Club"" (1984). In 1984 Coppola directed the Robert Evans-produced ""The Cotton Club"". The film was nominated for several awards, including Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and the Oscar for Best Film Editing. However the film failed miserably at the box-office, recouping only $25.9 million of the $47.9 million privately invested by brothers Fred and Ed Doumani. ""Rip Van Winkle"" (1984). The same year he directed an episode of ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" entitled ""Rip Van Winkle"", where Harry Dean Stanton played the lead role. ""Captain EO"" (1985). In 1985, along with producer George Lucas, he was able to indulge himself by making ""Captain EO"", a 17-minute space fantasy for Disney theme parks starring pop superstar Michael Jackson. At a cost of about one million dollars per minute of film, it was therefore, minute-for-minute, the most expensive motion picture made at the time. ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" (1986). In 1986 Coppola released the comedy ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" starring Kathleen Turner, Coppola's nephew Nicolas Cage and Jim Carrey. Much like ""The Outsiders"" and ""Rumble Fish"", ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" centered around teenage youth. The film earned Coppola positive feedback and provided Kathleen Turner her first and only Oscar nomination. It was the first box-office success for Coppola since ""Apocalypse Now"" and the film ranked number 17 on Entertainment Weekly's list of ""50 Best High School Movies."" ""Gardens of Stone"" (1987). The following year, Coppola re-teamed with James Caan for ""Gardens of Stone"", but the film was overshadowed by the death of Coppola's eldest son Gian-Carlo Coppola during the film's production. The movie was not a critical success and performed poorly at the box office, earning only $5.6 million against a budget of $13 million. ""Tucker: The Man and His Dream"" (1988). Coppola directed ""Tucker: The Man and His Dream"" the following year. A biopic based on the life of Preston Tucker and his attempt to produce and market the Tucker '48, Coppola had originally conceived the project as a musical with Marlon Brando after the release of ""The Godfather Part II"". Ultimately it was Jeff Bridges who played the role of Preston Tucker. Budgeted at $24 million, the film received positive reviews and earned three nominations at the 62nd Academy Awards, although its $19.65 million box office was a disappointment. Two awards came its way: Martin Landau won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and Dean Tavoularis took BAFTA's honors for Best Production Design. ""New York Stories"" (1989). In 1989 Coppola teamed up with fellow Oscar-winning directors Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen for an anthology film called ""New York Stories"". Coppola directed the ""Life Without Zoë"" segment, starring his sister Talia Shire and also co-wrote the film with his daughter Sofia Coppola. ""Life Without Zoë"" was mostly panned by critics and was generally considered the segment that brought the film's overall quality down. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a particularly scathing review, stating that ""It's impossible to know what Francis Coppola's ""Life Without Zoë"" is. Co-written with his daughter Sofia, the film is a mystifying embarrassment; it's by far the director's worst work yet."" 1990s. ""The Godfather Part III"" (1990). In 1990, he released the third and final chapter of ""The Godfather"" series: ""The Godfather Part III"". Coppola successfully managed to get Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire to return to the franchise, but Robert Duvall refused to reprise his role as Tom Hagen over salary disagreements. While not as critically acclaimed as the first two films, it was still a box office success, earning a revenue of $136 million against a budget of $54 million. Some reviewers criticized the casting of Coppola's daughter Sofia, who had stepped into the leading role of Mary Corleone which had been abandoned by Winona Ryder just as filming began. Despite this, ""The Godfather Part III"" went on to gather 7 Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture. The film failed to win any of these awards, the only film in the trilogy to do so. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992). In 1992, Coppola directed and produced ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". Adapted from Bram Stoker's novel, it was intended to be more faithful to the book than previous film adaptations. Coppola cast Gary Oldman in the film's title role, with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins in supporting roles. The movie became a box-office hit, grossing $82,522,790 domestically, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of the year. It fared much better overseas grossing $133,339,902 for a total worldwide gross of $215,862,692 against a budget of $40 million, making it the 9th highest grossing film of the year worldwide. The film won Academy Awards for Costume Design, Makeup and Sound Editing. ""Jack"" (1996). Coppola's next project was ""Jack"", which was released on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so at the age of ten he looks like a 40-year-old man. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin and Bill Cosby, ""Jack"" also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film ""Big"", in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for Jack he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director. ""The Rainmaker"" (1997). The last film Coppola directed in the 90s, ""The Rainmaker"" was based on the 1995 novel of the same name by John Grisham. An ensemble courtroom drama, the film was well received by critics, earning an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave ""The Rainmaker"" three stars out of four, remarking: ""I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels... but I've usually seen the storyteller's craft rather than the novelist's art being reflected. By keeping all of the little people in focus, Coppola shows the variety of a young lawyer's life, where every client is necessary and most of them need a lot more than a lawyer."" James Berardinelli also gave the film three stars out of four, saying that ""the intelligence and subtlety of ""The Rainmaker"" took me by surprise"" and that the film ""stands above any other filmed Grisham adaptation"". Grisham said of the film, ""To me it's the best adaptation of any of books... I love the movie. It's so well done."" The film grossed about $45 million domestically. This would be more than the estimated production budget of $40 million, but a disappointment compared with previous films adapted from a Grisham novel. ""Pinocchio"" dispute with Warner Bros.. In the late 1980s, Coppola started considering concepts for a motion picture based upon the 19th century novel ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" and in 1991, Coppola and Warner Bros. began discussing the project as well as two others: involving the life of J. Edgar Hoover and the children's novel ""The Secret Garden"". These discussions led to negotiations for Coppola to both produce and direct the ""Pinocchio"" project for Warners, as well as ""The Secret Garden"" (which was made in 1993 and produced by American Zoetrope, but directed by Agnieszka Holland) and ""Hoover"", which never came to fruition. (A film was eventually to be made by Clint Eastwood in 2011 as ""J. Edgar"", which was distributed by Warners.) But, in mid-1991, Coppola and Warners came to disagreement over the compensation to be paid to Coppola for his directing services on ""Pinocchio"". The parties deferred this issue and finally a settlement was reached in 1998, when the jurors in the resultant court case awarded Coppola $20 million as compensation for losing the ""Pinocchio"" film project. However, they also awarded him a further $60 million in punitive damages on top, stemming from his charges that Warner Bros. sabotaged his intended version. This is the largest civil financial verdict ever against a Hollywood studio. ""Contact"" dispute with Carl Sagan/Warner Bros.. During the filming of ""Contact"" on December 28, 1996, Coppola filed a lawsuit against Carl Sagan and Warner Bros.. Sagan had died a week earlier and Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel ""Contact"" was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975, titled ""First Contact"". Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions, as well as any novel Sagan would write. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon & Schuster published Sagan's ""Contact"" and Warner Bros. moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film. Even though Sagan was shown to have violated some of the terms of the agreement, the case was dismissed in February 1998 because Coppola had waited too long to file suit. 2000s. ""Youth Without Youth"" (2007). After a 10-year hiatus, Coppola returned to film direction with ""Youth Without Youth"" in 2007, based on the novella of the same name by Romanian author Mircea Eliade. The film was poorly reviewed, currently holding a 30% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was made for about $19 million and was given a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office. As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films in order to avoid the marketing input that goes into most films and so trying to make them appeal to too wide an audience. ""Tetro"" (2009). In 2009, Coppola released ""Tetro"". It was ""set in Argentina, with the reunion of two brothers. The story follows the rivalries born out of creative differences passed down through generations of an artistic Italian immigrant family."" The film received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the film has an average metascore of 63% based on 19 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 68% of critics gave positive reviews based on 71 reviews with an average score of 5.6/10. Overall, the Rotten Tomatoes consensus was: ""A complex meditation on family dynamics, ""Tetro""'s arresting visuals and emotional core compensate for its uneven narrative."" Roger Ebert of the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" gave the film 3 stars, praising the film for being ""boldly operatic, involving family drama, secrets, generations at war, melodrama, romance and violence"". Ebert also praised Vincent Gallo's performance and claimed that Alden Ehrenreich is ""the new Leonardo DiCaprio"". Todd McCarthy of ""Variety"" gave the film a B+ judging that ""when Coppola finds creative nirvana, he frequently has trouble delivering the full goods."" Richard Corliss of ""TIME"" gave the film a mixed review, praising Ehrenreich's performance, but claiming Coppola ""has made a movie in which plenty happens, but nothing rings true."" It has made $2,636,774 worldwide, against a budget of $5,000,000. 2010s. ""Twixt"" (2011). ""Twixt"", starring Val Kilmer, Elle Fanning, Joanne Whalley and Bruce Dern and narrated by Tom Waits, was released to film festivals in late 2011 and was released theatrically in early 2012. It has received critical acclaim in France. Commercial ventures. American Zoetrope. In 1971, Coppola and George Lucas co-produced the latter's first film, ""THX 1138"". Shortly after completion of production they brought the finished film to Warner Bros., along with several other scripts for potential projects at their newly-founded company, American Zoetrope. However, studio executives strongly disliked all the scripts, including ""THX"" and demanded that Coppola repay the $300,000 they had loaned him for the Zoetrope studio, as well as insisting on cutting five minutes from the film. The debt nearly closed Zoetrope and forced Coppola to (""reluctantly"") focus on ""The Godfather"". Zoetrope Virtual Studio. His company American Zoetrope also administers the innovative Zoetrope Virtual Studio, a complete motion picture production studio for members only. Launched in June 2000, the culmination of more than four years work, it brings together departments for screenwriters, directors, producers and other filmmaker artists, plus new departments for other creative endeavours, offering powerful e-collaborative tools. Filmmaker members can workshop a wide range of film arts, including music, graphics, design and film & video. Inglenook Winery. Coppola, with his family, expanded his business ventures to include winemaking in California's Napa Valley, when in 1975 he purchased the former home and adjoining vineyard of Gustave Niebaum in Rutherford, California using proceeds from the first movie in the ""Godfather"" trilogy. His winery produced its first vintage in 1977 with the help of his father, wife and children stomping the grapes barefoot and every year the family has a harvest party to continue the tradition. After purchasing the property, he produced wine under the Niebaum-Coppola label. When he purchased the former Inglenook Winery chateau in 1995, he renamed the winery Rubicon Estate Winery in 2006. On 11 April 2011, Coppola acquired the iconic Inglenook trademark paying more, he said, for the trademark than he did for the entire estate and announced that the estate would once again be known by its historic original name, Inglenook. Its grapes are now entirely organically grown and its Inglenook Chablis is one of the five most-widely-selling wines in US restaurants. Francis Ford Coppola Presents. Coppola is also the owner of Francis Ford Coppola Presents, a lifestyle brand under which he markets goods from companies he owns or controls. It includes films and videos, resorts, cafes, a literary magazine, a line of pastas and pasta sauces called Mammarella Foods and a winery. Winery. The Francis Ford Coppola Winery near Geyserville, California, located on the former Chateau Souverain Winery, where he has opened a family-friendly facility, is influenced by the idea of the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, with swimming pools, bocce courts and a restaurant. The winery displays several of Coppola's Oscars along with memorabilia from his movies, including Vito Corleone’s desk from ""The Godfather"" and a restored 1948 Tucker Sedan as used in """". Resorts. Included in the Francis Ford Coppola Presents lifestyle brand are several hotels and resorts around the world. The Blancaneaux Lodge in Belize, which from the early 1980s was a family retreat until it was opened to the public in 1993 as a 20-room luxury resort and The Turtle Inn, in Placencia, Belize, (both of which have won several prestigious awards including ""Travel + Leisure's World's Best: Best Resort in Central & South America""); La Lancha in Lago Petén Itzá, Guatemala; Jardin Escondido in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Palazzo Margherita in Bernalda, Italy. Cafe & Restaurant. In San Francisco, Coppola owns a restaurant named Cafe Zoetrope, located in the Sentinel Building where American Zoetrope is based. It serves traditional Italian cuisine and wine from his personal estate vineyard and bottling company and for 14 years he co-owned the Rubicon restaurant in San Francisco along with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. Rubicon closed in August 2008. Literary Publications. He brought out the San Francisco-based ""City Magazine"" in the 1970s, but lost $1.5 million on this venture. In 1997, Coppola founded """", a literary magazine devoted to short stories and design. The magazine publishes fiction by emerging writers alongside more recognizable names, such as Woody Allen, Margaret Atwood, Haruki Murakami, Alice Munro, Don DeLillo, Mary Gaitskill, and Edward Albee; as well as essays, including ones from Mario Vargas Llosa, David Mamet, Steven Spielberg, and Salman Rushdie. Each issue is designed, in its entirety, by a prominent artist, one usually working outside his / her expected field. Previous guest designers include Gus Van Sant, Tom Waits, Laurie Anderson, Marjane Satrapi, Guillermo del Toro, David Bowie, David Byrne, and Dennis Hopper. Coppola serves as founding editor and publisher of ""All-Story"". Other ventures. Coppola spends considerable time in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he is establishing a subsidiary of his production company, Zoetrope. He was the jury president at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival and he also took part as a special guest at the 46th International Thessaloniki Film Festival in Greece. Coppola stated that ""The Godfather Part IV"" was never made as Mario Puzo died before they had a chance to write the film. Andy Garcia has since claimed the film's script was nearly produced. Over the years, Francis Coppola has given political contributions to several candidates of the Democratic Party, including Mike Thompson and Nancy Pelosi for the U.S. House of Representatives and Barbara Boxer and Alan Cranston for the U.S. Senate. For quite some time, he had been planning to direct an epic movie named ""Megalopolis"", a story about the aftermath and reconstruction of New York City after a mega-disaster, but after the city was hit by the real life disaster of September 11, the project was suddenly seen as being too sensitive. In 2007 he stated that ""I have abandoned that as of now. I plan to begin a process of making one personal movie after another and if something leads me back to look at that, which I'm sure it might, I'll see what makes sense to me."" Personal life. In February 1963, Coppola married Eleanor Neil, whom he met on the set of ""Dementia 13"". They had three children: Gian-Carlo, born 1963; Roman, born 1965 and Sofia, born 1971. Gian-Carlo Coppola, was in the early stages of a film production career when he was killed on May 26, 1986 in a speedboat accident. His daughter Gia was born to Jacqui de la Fontaine after he died in 1986 and is now an actress. Sofia Coppola appeared in all three ""Godfather"" films, the first two movies uncredited: as the infant being baptised at the end of ""The Godfather""; as a young child on board ship in ""The Godfather Part II"" and in a supporting role as Michael Corleone's daughter Mary in ""The Godfather Part III"" and is now an Academy Award-winning writer and nominated director. Her films include ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation"". In 2004, she became the first American woman to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for ""Lost in Translation"". Coppola's surviving son, Roman Coppola, is a filmmaker and music video director whose filmography includes the feature film ""CQ"" and music videos for The Strokes, as well as co-writing two Wes Anderson films, ""The Darjeeling Limited"" and ""Moonrise Kingdom"". He was also second-unit director on ""Bram Stokers Dracula"". Coppola often works with family members in his films: He cast his two sons in ""The Godfather"" as extras during the street fight scene involving Sonny and Carlo Rizzi and at Vito Corleone’s funeral. His sister, Talia Shire, played Connie Corleone in all three ""Godfather"" films. His father Carmine, a composer and professional musician, co-wrote much of the music for ""The Godfather"", ""The Godfather Part II"" (for which he received an Oscar for Best Music, Original Dramatic Score, shared with Nino Rota) and ""The Godfather Part III"" (for which he was nominated for another Oscar for Best Original Song) and ""Apocalypse Now"" (for which he was nominated for a BAFTA Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music). In addition, Carmine and his wife Italia appear as the couple in the elevator scene in ""One from the Heart"". Coppola's nephew, Nicolas Cage, son of his brother, the academic August Coppola, starred in Coppola's film ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" and was featured in ""Rumble Fish"" and ""The Cotton Club"". Other famous members of Coppola's family include nephews Jason Schwartzman and Robert Schwartzman, sons of Talia Shire. Jason Schwartzman has starred in several films, including ""Rushmore"" and ""Slackers"". He also co-wrote (along with director Wes Anderson and cousin Roman Coppola) and starred in the 2007 film ""The Darjeeling Limited"". Robert Schwartzman is the lead singer in the band Rooney and appeared in ""The Princess Diaries"" as well as having small appearances in several films, including his cousin Sofia's ""The Virgin Suicides"". An interesting insight into Coppola's attitudes and feelings was given when answering the standard Bernard Pivot questions at the conclusion of his interview episode of the ""Inside the Actors Studio"" TV programme (Season 7, Episode 14): Honors. In the 2002 poll of the Sight and Sound publication, Coppola ranked #4 in the Directors' top ten directors of all time and #10 in the Critics' top ten directors of all time. He featured at #17 in MovieMaker Magazine's 25 most influential directors of all-time. He also ranked #9 in toptenreviews' list of top directors of all time and at #21 in Entertainment Weekly's top 50 directors of all time. Four of Coppola's films, ""The Godfather""; ""The Godfather Part II""; ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Patton"" featured in the Writers Guild of America, West list of 101 greatest screenplays ever. Three of his films feature in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies: ""The Godfather"" (at #2), ""Apocalypse Now"" (at #28) and ""The Godfather Part II"" (at #32). ""The Godfather"" also ranks at #11 in AFI's 100 Years…100 Thrills. The following Coppola films were also nominated for the list: ""American Graffiti"" (1973) - Producer; ""The Conversation"" (1974) - Director/Producer/Screenwriter; ""Patton"" (1970) - Screenwriter.

He was given an honorary award at the 2007 Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival. In 2010, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to honor him with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the 2nd Governor's Awards in November. The honor was bestowed on him on November 13, along with Jean-Luc Godard, Kevin Brownlow and Eli Wallach. There are three generations of Oscar winners in the Coppola family: Carmine, his son Francis Ford, his granddaughter Sofia Coppola and his grandson Nicolas Cage. They are the second family to do so, the first being the Hustons - Walter Huston, John Huston and Anjelica Huston. Coppola serves as the ""Honorary Consul H. E. Francis Ford Coppola"" in San Francisco for the Central American nation of Belize. George Lucas said that he based the Han Solo character in ""Star Wars"" on Coppola. "

wikipedia-11994459," Beriev A-60  The Beriev A-60 is a Soviet/Russian airborne laser laboratory aircraft based on the Ilyushin Il-76MD transport. In the 1970s a special aviation complex was established by the Soviets at Taganrog machine-building factory to develop airborne laser technology for the Soviet military. In 1977 Beriev OKB started the design of a flying laboratory designated '1А'. The purpose was to solve the complex scientific and engineering problems regarding the creation of an airborne laser and also to facilitate research on the distribution of beams in the top layers of an atmosphere. Work on this topic occurred with wide cooperation between the enterprises and the scientific organizations of the USSR, but the basic partner OKB was TSKB Almaz headed by B.V.Bunkin. Design. The Il-76MD was selected as a base aircraft for the flying laboratory. In order to accommodate the laser a lot of changes were done on the basic Il-76 design. These modifications have drastically changed the appearance of the plane. Hence the problem of accommodating the laser gun was solved and it did not spoil the aerodynamics of the base aircraft. The laser system was 1 MW, created by one of the branches of the Institute of Atomic Energy, Kurchatov. This gas laser, operating on carbon dioxide, was developed for installation on the aircraft IL-76. The '1A' flying laboratory first flew on 19 August 1981 under E.A. Lakhmostov. On 29 August 1991, the crew led by test pilot V.P. Demyanovski flew the second flying laboratory which received the name '1А2' СССР-86879. There a new variant of a laser system was installed as a result of various tests on '1А'. Apparently, after being mothballed for more than a decade and half, the project recently (May 2009) was reactivated, according to the eyewitness accounts about an A-60 spotted flying in Rostov on Don and Taganrog region. Now it is parked in Taganrog airport. 47°11'53.92""N 38°51'46.05""E Russia is still developing the military airborne laser mounted in a A-60. Recently a second aircraft was made.

wikipedia-37780," Anglo-Saxons  The Anglo-Saxons were the population in Britain partly descended from the Germanic tribes who migrated from continental Europe and settled the south and east of the island beginning in the early 5th century. The Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period of English history after their initial settlement through their creation of the English nation, up to the Norman conquest; that is, between about 550 and 1066. The term Anglo-Saxon is also used for the language, today more correctly called Old English, that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England (and parts of south-eastern Scotland) between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century, after which it is known as Middle English. The Benedictine monk Bede, writing in the early 8th century, identified the English as the descendants of three Germanic tribes: Their language, Anglo-Saxon or Old English, which derived from Ingvaeonic West Germanic dialects, transformed into Middle English from the 11th century. The language was divided into four main dialects: West Saxon, Mercian, Northumbrian and Kentish. Etymology. The term ""Anglo-Saxon"" can be found in documents produced in the time of Alfred the Great, who seems to have frequently used the titles ""rex Anglorum Saxonum"" and ""rex Angul-Saxonum"" (king of the English Saxons). The terms ""ænglisc"" ('Angle-kin') and ""Angelcynn"" ('gens Anglorum') had already lost their original sense of referring to the Angles, as distinct from the Saxons, when they are first attested. In their earliest sense they referred to the nation of Germanic peoples who settled eastern Britain from the 5th century. The indigenous Britons, who wrote in both Latin and Welsh, referred to these invaders as 'Saxones' or 'Saeson' – the word ""Saeson"" is the modern Welsh word for 'English people'; the equivalent word in Scottish Gaelic is ""Sasannach"" and in the Irish language, ""Sasanach"". The term ""Angli Saxones"" seems to have first been used in continental writing nearly a century before Alfred's time, by Paul the Deacon, historian of the Lombards, probably to distinguish the English Saxons from the continental Saxons (""Ealdseaxe"", literally, 'old Saxons'). The Angles (), took their name from their ancestral home in Jutland, Angul (modern Angeln), which has an area in the shape of a hook (Old English: ""angel"", ""angul"" ""fishhook"", ""anga"" ""hook""). History. The history of Anglo-Saxon England broadly covers early medieval England, from the end of Roman rule and the establishment of numerous Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the 5th century until the Norman conquest of England by the Normans in 1066. Origins (400–600). The migration of Germanic peoples to Britain from what is now northern Germany, the northern part of the Netherlands and southern Scandinavia is attested from the 5th century (e.g. Undley bracteate). Based on Bede's ""Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum"", the intruding population is traditionally divided into Angles, Saxons and Jutes, but their composition was likely less clear-cut and may also have included peoples such as the Frisii and the Franks. The ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" may contain the first recorded indications of the movement of these Germanic tribes to Britain. Heptarchy (600–800). Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons began in Britain in 597 and was at least nominally completed in 686. Throughout the 7th and 8th centuries, power fluctuated between the larger kingdoms. Bede records Aethelbert of Kent as being dominant at the close of the 6th century, but power then seems to have shifted northwards to the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. Aethelbert and some of the later kings of the other kingdoms were recognised by their fellow kings as Bretwalda (ruler of Britain). The so-called 'Mercian Supremacy' dominated the 8th century, though again it was not constant. Aethelbald and Offa, the two most powerful kings of this period, achieved high status. This period has been described as the Heptarchy, though this term has now fallen out of academic use. The word arose on the basis that the seven kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, East Anglia, Essex, Sussex and Wessex were the main polities of south Britain. More recent scholarship has shown that theories of the 'heptarchy' are not grounded in evidence, and it is far more likely that power fluctuated between many more 'kingdoms'. Other politically important 'kingdoms' across this period include: Hwicce, Magonsaete, Kingdom of Lindsey and Middle Anglia. Viking Age and the Norman Conquest (800–1066). In the 9th century, the Viking challenge grew to serious proportions. Alfred the Great's victory at Edington, Wiltshire, in 878 brought intermittent peace, but with their possession of Jorvik, the Danes gained a solid foothold in England. Some of the earliest arrivals of invaders came in the form of small groups or companies of Danish heritage. It is widely believed they left their homelands for more religious freedom as they did not like Christianity being forced upon them. There was no prior indication for them being there before their arrival and thus little resistance if any at all from locals. They attacked various locations in England, and they were seemingly sporadic. For example these raiders attacked three different locations; Hampshire, Thanet, and Cheshire around 980, but no raids were recorded afterwards for another six years. The most notable event to come from these raids however was, that it was the first time that England came into contact with any form of diplomacy from Normandy. They became hostile towards one another by summer in the year 990. Their feud became so great that Pope John XV had to send an envoy with a treaty in order to settle their quarrel. It was a Christmas Day in the year 990 the commission was presented to King Æthelred the Unready, and soon the council drew up a set of terms which were sent to the Duke of Normandy. The doctrine stated that neither shall befriend the others enemies, and that they should accept a reparation from any damage which either could sustain from the other nation. An important development in the 9th century was the rise of the Kingdom of Wessex; by the end of his reign Alfred was recognised as overlord by several southern kingdoms. Æthelstan was the first king to achieve direct rule over what is considered ""England"". Near the end of the 10th century, there was renewed Scandinavian interest in England, with the conquests of Sweyn of Denmark and his son Cnut the Great. By 1066 there were three lords with claims to the English throne, resulting in two invasions and the battles of Stamford Bridge and Hastings. The latter, which heralded the Norman conquest of England, resulted in the overthrow of the Anglo-Saxon polity and its replacement with Norman rule. After the Norman Conquest. Following the conquest, the Anglo-Saxon nobility were either exiled or joined the ranks of the peasantry. It has been estimated that only about 8 per cent of the land was under Anglo-Saxon control by 1087. Many Anglo-Saxon nobles fled to Scotland, Ireland, and Scandinavia. The Byzantine Empire became a popular destination for many Anglo-Saxon soldiers, as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries. The Anglo-Saxons became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, hitherto a largely North Germanic unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn and continued to serve the empire until the early 15th century. However, the population of England at home remained largely Anglo-Saxon; for them, little changed immediately except that their Anglo-Saxon lord was replaced by a Norman lord. Culture. Architecture. Early Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, not using masonry except in foundations but constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers or sited to serve as ports. In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth. There are few remains of Anglo-Saxon architecture, with but one secular work remaining above ground – a 10m. x 5m. houscarl's dwelling re-using local Roman materials. This is still completely standing as an undivided single room with a single central north-facing door, belonging to the Godwin estates, so can be dated 1018–1066. At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin, with many more claimed to be, in part from their dedication to local Anglo-Saxon saints, although in some cases the Anglo-Saxon part is small and much-altered. All surviving churches, except one timber church, are built of stone or brick and in some cases show evidence of re-used Roman work. The character of Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical buildings ranges from Celtic influenced architecture in the early period; basilica influenced Romanesque architecture; to in the later Anglo-Saxon period, an architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. Art. Early Anglo-Saxon art developed Continental Germanic styles in jewellery and other metalwork, and culminates in the exceptional finds from the royal ship burial at Sutton Hoo, deposited on the cusp of Christianization in about the 620s. Christianity brought influences from Celtic art through Irish missionaries to Nothumbria, and from Italy and the Christian continent through Gregory and his successors in the South. Northumbria was crucial in the development of the Insular style of Northern Britain and Ireland, which fused Anglo-Saxon and Celtic techniques and motifs in applying them to forms of objects imported with Christianity, such as books, stone sculpture and ecclesistical metalwork. This also influenced the south, which was also developing its own style. Secular survivals are mostly jewellery, for both sexes and including fittings for warriors and their weapons, the main contents of the over 3,500 pieces in the Staffordshire Hoard discovered in 2009, probably dating to the 7th and 8th centuries. The Anglo-Saxons preferred round brooches throughout the period, unlike Continental fibula types or the Celtic penannular brooches. The disruption caused by the period of Viking invasions greatly reduced artistic production, and the style that emerged afterwards was driven by southern centres, and increasingly aware of Continental art. Towards the end of the period artistic patronage, mostly for monasteries, by the elite became very lavish, with metalwork the most highly regarded form of art, though none of the larger objects in precious metals recorded have survived. Anglo-Saxon art is mainly known today through metalwork and illuminated manuscripts, including the ""Benedictional of St. Æthelwold"" (British Library) and ""Leofric Missal"" (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodl, 579), masterpieces of the late ""Winchester style"", which drew on Hiberno-Saxon art, Carolingian art and Byzantine art for style and iconography, and combined both northern ornamental traditions with Mediterranean figural traditions. The Harley Psalter was a copy of the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter — which was a particular influence in creating an Anglo-Saxon style of very lively pen drawings. Manuscripts were far from the only Anglo-Saxon art form, but they have survived in much greater numbers than other types of object. Contemporaries in Europe regarded Anglo-Saxon goldsmithing and embroidery (Opus Anglicanum) as especially fine. Perhaps the best known piece of Anglo-Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by a Norman patron from English artists working in the traditional Anglo-Saxon style. The most common example of Anglo-Saxon art is coins, with thousands of examples extant. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in fresco, ivory, stone carving, metalwork (see Fuller brooch for example) and enamel, but few of these pieces have survived. Language. Old English, sometimes called Anglo-Saxon, was the language spoken under Alfred the Great and continued to be the common language of (non-Danelaw) England until after the Norman Conquest of 1066 when, under the influence of the Anglo-Norman language spoken by the Norman ruling class, it changed into Middle English roughly between 1150–1500. Old English is far closer to early Germanic than Middle English. It is less Latinised and retains many morphological features (nominal and verbal inflection) that were lost during the 12th to 14th centuries. The languages today which are closest to English are the Frisian languages, which are spoken by a few hundred thousand people in Friesland in the Netherlands, Saterland in Lower Saxony, Germany, and in North Firesland in southwest Denmark. Before literacy in the vernacular Old English or Latin became widespread, a runic alphabet, the ""futhorc"", was used for inscriptions. When literacy became more prevalent, a form of Latin script was used with a couple of letters derived from the futhorc: 'thorn' ‹þ› and 'wynn' ‹ƿ› (generally replaced with ‹w› in modern reproductions). The letters regularly used in printed and edited texts of Old English are the following: with only rare occurrences of ""j"", ""k"", ""q"", ""v"", and ""z"". Law. Very few law codes exist from the Anglo-Saxon period to provide an insight into legal culture beyond the influence of Roman law and how this legal culture developed over the course of time. The Saxons chopped off hands and noses for punishment (if the offender stole something or committed another crime). If someone killed a Saxon, he had to pay money called wergild, the amount varying according to the social rank of the victim. Literature. Old English literary works include genres such as epic poetry, hagiography, sermons, Bible translations, legal works, chronicles, riddles and others. In all there are about 400 surviving manuscripts from the period, a significant corpus of both popular interest and specialist research. The most famous works from this period include the poem ""Beowulf"", which has achieved national epic status in Britain. The ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" is a collection of important early English history. ""Cædmon's Hymn"" from the 7th century is the earliest attested literary text in English. Religion. The indigenous pre-Christian belief system of the Anglo-Saxons was a form of Germanic paganism and therefore closely related to the Old Norse religion, as well as other Germanic pre-Christian cultures. Christianity gradually replaced the indigenous religion of the English around the 7th and 8th centuries. Celtic Christianity was introduced into Northumbria and Mercia by monks from Ireland, but the Synod of Whitby settled the choice for Roman Christianity. As the new clerics became the chroniclers, the old religion was partially lost before it was recorded, and today historians' knowledge of it is largely based on surviving customs and lore, texts, etymological links and archaeological finds. One of the few recorded references is that a Kentish King would only meet the missionary St. Augustine in the open air, where he would be under the protection of the sky god, Woden. Written Christian prohibitions on acts of paganism are one of historians' main sources of information on pre-Christian beliefs. Despite these prohibitions, numerous elements of the pre-Christian culture of the Anglo-Saxon people survived the Christianisation process. Examples include the English language names for days of the week: Contemporary meanings. ""Anglo-Saxon"" in linguistics is still used as a term for the original West Germanic component of the modern English language, which was later expanded and developed through the influence of Old Norse and Norman French, though linguists now more often refer to it as Old English. In the 19th century the term ""Anglo-Saxon"" was broadly used in philology, and is sometimes so used at present. In Victorian Britain, some writers such as Robert Knox, James Anthony Froude, Charles Kingsley and Edward A. Freeman used the term ""Anglo-Saxon"" to justify racism and imperialism, claiming that the ""Anglo-Saxon"" ancestry of the English made them racially superior to the colonised peoples. Similar racist ideas were advocated in the 19th-century United States by Samuel George Morton and George Fitzhugh. The term ""Anglo-Saxon"" is sometimes used to refer to peoples descended or associated in some way with the English ethnic group, but there is no universal definition for the term. In contemporary Anglophone cultures outside Britain, ""Anglo-Saxon"" may be contrasted with ""Celtic"" as a socioeconomic identifier, invoking or reinforcing historical prejudices against non-English British immigrants. ""White Anglo-Saxon Protestant"", i.e. WASP, is a term especially popular in the United States that refers chiefly to old wealthy families with mostly English ancestors. As such, WASP is not a historical label or a precise ethnological term, but rather a reference to contemporary family-based political, financial and cultural power— e.g., The Boston Brahmin. The French often use ""Anglo-Saxon"" to refer to the combined power of Britain and the US today. Outside Anglophone countries, both in Europe and in the rest of the world, the term ""Anglo-Saxon"" and its direct translations are used to refer to the Anglophone peoples and societies of Britain, the United States, and other countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand – areas which are sometimes referred to as the Anglosphere. The term ""Anglo-Saxon"" can be used in a variety of contexts, often to identify the English-speaking world's distinctive language, culture, technology, wealth, markets, economy, and legal systems. Variations include the German ""Angelsachsen"", French ""Anglo-Saxon"", Spanish ""anglosajón"", Portuguese ""anglo-saxão"", Polish ""anglo-saksoński"", Italian ""anglosassone"", Catalan ""anglosaxó"", Japanese ""Angurosakuson"" and Ukrainian ""aнглосакси"" (anhlosaksy). As with the English language use of the term, what constitutes the ""Anglo-Saxon"" varies from speaker to speaker. See also. Modern concepts: "
wikipedia-1810915," Organ repertoire  The organ repertoire consists of music written for the organ. Because it is one of the oldest musical instruments in existence, written organ repertoire spans a time period almost as long as that of written music itself. The organ's solo repertoire is among the largest for any musical instrument. Because the organ was found almost exclusively in the western churches from the Middle Ages until the emergence in the Romantic era of large concert hall instruments, a significant portion of organ repertoire is sacred in nature. Thus, most organ music comes from Western Europe and North America; because the eastern religions (such as the Eastern Orthodox Church) did not use any instruments in their worship. Owing to the age of the instrument and its frequent use in Western worship, the organ has one of the most varied repertoires of any instrument. Renaissance. The earliest surviving keyboard compositions (keyboard music was not instrument-specific until the sixteenth century) are from England (Robertsbridge Codex c. 1365) and Italy (Faenza Codex, 15th century). The English virginal style was a manner of composition and performance prevalent in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries; some manuscripts are preserved in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. Sweelinck was strongly influenced by this style. Organ music was almost exclusively based on learned contrapuntal, exemplified by the Fantasia (""Fancy""), as well as works based on contrapuntal treatment of chant. Composers well known for their choral works wrote organ music, for example Tallis, Byrd and Gibbons. Baroque. France. In France, baroque organ music (referred to as French classical music, despite being from the Baroque period) was almost exclusively liturgical in nature and composed and performed in a very systemized manner. In addition, the organs were built along standardized lines. The compositions were smaller scale compared with those in other countries. Some of the forms (the Plein jeu, the Récit de Cromorne, and the Tierce en Taille, for example) utilized almost no counterpoint, while others (the Duo, the Trio, and the Fugue) were contrapuntal in nature (though the counterpoint was not generally as complex as in Germany). England. Handel is primarily known for his numerous organ concertos. Germany. In Germany and Austria, baroque organ music utilized increasing amounts of counterpoint. Organ music in the baroque can be divided into works based on Lutheran chorales (e.g. chorale preludes and chorale fantasias) and those not (e.g. toccatas, fantasias and free preludes). There are marked stylistic differences between the composers of North, South and Central Germany such that further generalisation is inaccurate. The North German Praeludium (an important form consisting of alternating sections of free material written in the largely misunderstood ""stylus phantasticus"" and fugal material) reached its zenith in Dieterich Buxtehude, informed by Matthias Weckmann and Heinrich Scheidemann (influenced most strongly by Jan Peeterszoon Sweelinck and by the Italian school transported to North Germany by Heinrich Schütz and Samuel Scheidt). Georg Böhm remained firmly representative of the South German School, though Johann Pachelbel's influence as a teacher extended across North, South and Central Germany. Baroque organ music arguably reached its height in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Many of Bach's earlier free works are heavily influenced by Buxtehude's style, but much more importantly, Bach developed a style essentially separate from the predominant styles of North, South and Central Germany. The majority of his free works consisted of two parts: a prelude, toccata or fantasia, and a fugue. Bach also wrote a large number of chorale preludes. Classical era. The great composers of the classical era wrote sparingly if at all for the organ: Haydn wrote for clockwork organs, and wrote several concerti for organ & orchestra. Beethoven and Mozart wrote only a handful of works. Brixli and Wagenseil also wrote organ concerti. All works are restricted to a single manual. English composers John Stanley and William Boyce wrote a number of important works at this time but should be considered composers of the baroque, not classical era. Romantic era. France. During the Romantic era, technological advances allowed new features to be added to the organ, increasing its potential for expression. The work of the French organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll in particular represented a great leap in organ building. Cavaillé-Coll refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters. He invented an ingenious pneumatic combination action system for his five-manual organ at Saint-Sulpice. He adjusted pipemaking and voicing techniques, thus creating a whole family of stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe, and the flute. He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils, allowing for the use of higher wind pressures. For a mechanical tracker action to operate under these higher wind pressures, pneumatic assistance provided by the Barker lever was required, which Cavaillé-Coll included in his larger instruments. This pneumatic assist made it possible to couple all the manuals together and play on the full organ without expending a great deal of effort. All these innovations allowed the organist to execute a seamless crescendo from ""pianissimo"" all the way to ""fortissimo"": something that had never before been possible by the organ. Composers were now able to write music for the organ which mirrored that played by the symphony orchestra. For this reason, both the organs and the literature of this time period are considered ""symphonic"". César Franck, Charles-Marie Widor, and Félix-Alexandre Guilmant were important organist-composers who were inspired by the sounds made possible through Cavaillé-Coll's advances in organ building. They wrote extensively for the organ, and their works have endured. A particularly important form of organ composition in the Romantic era was the organ symphony, first seen in César Franck's ""Grand pièce symphonique"" and refined in the ten symphonies of Widor and the six of Louis Vierne. The organ symphony, comprising several movements, paralleled symphonies written for the orchestra. Guilmant wrote several compositions similar to organ symphonies; however, preferring to remain in the classical mold, he called them sonatas. In addition to organ symphonies, composers of the day wrote in other forms: Franck wrote eleven other major organ works, including the ""Prélude, Fugue et Variation"" and the ""Trois Chorals""; Widor wrote a ""Suite Latine"" on various plainsong tunes; Vierne composed ""24 pièces de fantaisie"", of which the ""Carillon de Westminster"" is perhaps the best-known. The influence of these composers has persisted through generations of composers for the organ through history, all the way to the modern-day composers Olivier Messiaen and Naji Hakim. Germany. In Germany, a revival of interest in organ music began with Felix Mendelssohn. He wrote six Sonatas, three Preludes & Fugues, and several smaller works for the organ. Josef Rheinberger wrote 20 sonatas for the organ and numerous smaller works, all of which blend the romantic style with the contrapuntal complexity of the old German masters. Johannes Brahms and Robert Schumann did not leave any large-scale works for the organ, but both left behind some smaller works which have attracted considerable attention. During the mid-19th century, composers such as Franz Liszt and Julius Reubke wrote works for the organ of immense scale. Organs being built during this time were larger and had greater dynamic range than organs of the Baroque period, and Romantic composers were determined to exploit the capabilities of these instruments. One of Liszt's most famous organ works is his Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale Ad nos ad salutarem undam. The entire 30-minute work is based on a single theme by Giacomo Meyerbeer and it shows the influence of Liszt's Sonata in B minor for piano. Liszt's student, Reubke, wrote a programmatic Sonata in C minor based on selected verses from Psalm 94. The work, while original in its own right, is heavily influenced by the work of Liszt. These two works are the most monumental compositions for the organ from the mid-19th century. Organ music in Germany at the end of the 19th century is dominated by the towering figure of Max Reger. Reger's works represent extreme Romanticism; extremely dense harmonies, sudden dynamic contrasts, and extensive forms are all present in Reger's organ works. In the 20th-century, German organ music was strongly influenced by the neo-Baroque movement. A revival of interest in Baroque forms and performance practices led to a rejection of the complexity and Romanticism of Liszt and Reger. Important composers of this period are Hugo Distler and Paul Hindemith. Hindemith is widely known for his three organ sonatas. Distler's organ music is not as well-known, and Distler is remembered primarily as a choral composer. His most popular work is the Partita on ""Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland"", a work which treats the old Lutheran chorale in a clearly modern idiom. United States. In the United States, Dudley Buck was a prominent composer, although his work has remained largely unknown outside of the U.S. During this time, transcriptions of other music (usually orchestral music or piano solos) for organ became popular. Often the transcriptions would utilize only an excerpt of the original piece. The most famous transcriber for the organ is Edwin Lemare. He transcribed hundreds of works for the organ, the most memorable being his transcriptions of Wagner works. 20th century. During the 20th century, there were a number of independent trends in organ repertoire: "
wikipedia-1284942," Drop shipping  Drop shipping is a supply chain management technique in which the retailer does not keep goods in stock, but instead transfers customer orders and shipment details to either the manufacturer or a wholesaler, who then ships the goods directly to the customer. As in retail businesses, the majority of retailers make their profit on the difference between the wholesale and retail price but some retailers earn an agreed percentage of the sales in commission, paid by the wholesaler to the retailer. Procedure. Some drop shipping retailers may keep ""display items"" on display in stores, so that customers can inspect an item similar to those that they can purchase. Other retailers may provide only a catalogue or website of their products . Retailers that drop ship merchandise from wholesalers may take measures to hide this fact to avoid any stigma, or to keep the wholesale source from becoming widely known. This can be achieved by ""blind shipping"" (shipping merchandise without a return address), or ""private label shipping"" (having merchandise shipped from the wholesaler with a return address customized to the retailer). A customized packing slip may also be included by the wholesaler, indicating the retailer's company name, logo, and/or contact information. Small business. Drop shipping can occur when a small retailer who typically sells in small quantities to the general public receives a single large order for a product. Rather than route the shipment through the retail store, the retailer may arrange for the goods to be shipped directly to the customer. Drop shipping is also very common with big ticket items like steel buildings where the retailer will take a deposit and have the building shipped direct to the buyer's building site from the supplier's manufacturing facility. Online auctions. Many sellers on online auction sites, such as eBay, also drop ship. Often, a seller will list an item as new and ship the item directly from the retailer or wholesaler to the highest bidder. The seller profits from the difference between the winning bid and the wholesale price, minus any selling and merchant fees from the auction site. Custom products. An emerging trend in the drop ship business is private label drop shipping, in which a manufacturer produces a custom item for a retailer and drop ships it. The range of private label drop shipped items varies from simple keychains and t-shirts with custom logos or pictures to customized formulations for vitamins and nutritional supplements. Developments. Major drop shipping suppliers and fulfillment services are primarily based in the USA.  Since 2006 many drop ship companies have emerged in China, many of which offer wholesale and drop shipping services to both companies and individuals. This is largely due to the increasing ease of e-procurement and the growing part that the internet is playing in e-commerce. Drop ship suppliers based in China have increasingly been able to compete with same-country distributors because of improved logistics for small packets and the easing of trade barriers. Benefits. Two significant benefits of drop shipping are the elimination of upfront inventory and a positive cash-flow cycle. A positive cash flow cycle occurs because the seller is paid when the purchase is made. The seller usually pays the wholesaler using a credit card or credit terms. Therefore, there is a period of time in which the seller has the customer's money, but has not yet paid the wholesaler.  Drop shipping also eliminates some duplication of effort, since only one warehouse will pick, pack and ship the product. This approach can reduce total inventory management and shipping costs. These cost reductions can subsequently reduce the price to the consumer. Risks. As in any business, some risks are involved in drop shipping. For example, backordering may occur when a seller places a shipment request with a wholesaler, but the product is sold out. Backordering may be accompanied by a long wait for a shipment while the wholesaler waits for new products, which may reflect badly on the retailer. A good wholesaler will keep retailers updated, but it is the business owner's job to be aware of the quantities that the wholesaler has available. Drop shipping has also featured prominently in some Internet-based home business scams. Scam artists will promote drop shipping as a lucrative ""work from home opportunity."" The victim who buys into this scam will be sold a list of businesses from which drop-shipment orders can be placed. These businesses may not be wholesalers, but other businesses or individuals acting as middlemen between retailers and wholesalers, with no product of their own to sell. These middlemen often charge prices that leave little profit margin for the victim, and require a regular fee for the retailer's usage of their services. Related concepts. The converse of drop shipping is ""will call,"" where a customer picks up directly from a wholesaler, rather than via a retail shop. Affiliate marketing can also be compared to drop shipping. As with drop shipping, affiliate marketing allows a website to list an item for sale that is not on hand but rather is shipped through a third party. "
wikipedia-299828," Treskilling Yellow  The ""Treskilling"" Yellow, or three schilling banco error of color (, literally ""yellow three skilling banco""), is a Swedish postage stamp, known to exist in only one copy, and it holds the world's record sale price at auction for a postage stamp. This stamp was canceled at Nya Kopparberget (now known as Kopparberg), about 150 kilometers from Uppsala, on July 13, 1857. History. In 1855, Sweden issued its first postage stamps, in a set of five values depicting the Swedish coat of arms, with denominations ranging from three to 24 Swedish skillings. The three-skilling stamp was normally printed in a blue-green color, with the eight-skilling stamp being printed in yellowish orange. It is not known exactly what went wrong, but the most likely explanation is that a stereotype of the eight-skilling printing plate (which consisted of 100 stereotypes assembled into a 10 × 10 array) was damaged or broken, and it was mistakenly replaced with a three-skilling. The number of stamps printed in the wrong color is unknown, but so far only one example has been found. Somehow, this error went entirely unnoticed at the time, and by 1873 the Swedish currency was changed. The skilling stamps were replaced by new stamps denominated in ""öre"". In 1886, a young collector named Georg Wilhelm Backman was going through covers in his grandmother's attic at the farm Väster Munga Gård north of Västerås, and came across one with a three-skilling stamp, for which the Stockholm stamp dealer Heinrich Lichtenstein was offering seven kronor apiece. After it had changed hands several times, Sigmund Friedl sold it to Philipp von Ferrary in 1894, who had at that time the largest known stamp collection in the world, and paid the breathtaking sum of 4,000 Austro-Hungarian gulden. As time passed, and no other ""yellows"" surfaced despite vigorous searching, it became clear that the stamp was not only rare, but quite possibly the only surviving example. When Ferrary's collection was auctioned in the 1920s, Swedish Baron Eric Leijonhufvud bought the yellow stamp, and then Claes A. Tamm bought it in 1926 for £1,500 (pound sterling) in order to complete his collection of Swedish stamps. In 1928, the stamp was sold to the lawyer Johan Ramberg for £2,000, and he kept it for the nine years. In 1937, King Carol II of Romania purchased it from London auction house H. R. Harmer for £5,000, and in 1950 it went to Rene Berlingen for an unknown amount of money. In the 1970s, the Swedish Postal Museum caused controversy by declaring the stamp to be a forgery, but after examinations by two different commissions, it was agreed that this was a genuine stamp. In 1984, the yellow stamp made headlines when it was sold by David Feldman for 977,500 Swiss francs. It was resold in 1990 for over $1,000,000. Then, in 1996 it sold again for 2,880,000 Swiss francs. Each successive sale was a world record price for a postage stamp. On 22 May 2010, the yellow stamp was auctioned once again by David Feldman in Geneva, Switzerland. It sold ""for at least the $2.3 million price it set a record for in 1996"". The buyer reportedly was an ""international consortium"" and the seller was a financial firm auctioning the stamp to pay the former owner's debt. The exact price and the identity of the buyer were not disclosed, however, and all bidders reportedly were sworn to secrecy. The buyer has subsequently been identified as Armand Rousso, ""a colorful philatelic player ... known ... for a number of high profile activities."" Jean-Claude Andre lawsuit. In or before 2012, Baron Jean-Claude Pierre Ferdinand Gunther Andre and his wife Jane Andre brought a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, London, against Clydesdale Bank PLC, claiming that he had stored a locked trunk at the bank in which there allegedly were six covers bearing a total of nine Treskilling Yellow stamps, along with other less valuable items. Andre claimed that he had left the trunk undisturbed from 1986 to 2004, but when he sought to retrieve it the lock had been removed and the covers and stamps taken. Philatelic dealer David Feldman testified that the covers would have been worth some 3.7 million pounds sterling. After a lengthy trial, the court issued a judgment dated January 31 – February 1, 2013, in which it rejected Andre's claim, finding him and his wife unreliable witnesses and their claim suffering from ""sheer inherent implausibility"". "
wikipedia-174799," Open field system  The open field system was the prevalent agricultural system in much of Europe during the Middle Ages and lasted into the 20th century in parts of western Europe, Russia, and Iran. Under the open field system, each manor or village had two or three large fields, usually several hundred acres each, which were divided into many narrow strips of land. The strips or selions were cultivated by individuals or peasant families, often called tenants or serfs. The holdings of a manor also included woodland and pasture areas for common usage and fields belonging to the lord of the manor and the church. The farmers customarily lived in individual houses in a nucleated village with a much larger manor house and church nearby. The open field system necessitated cooperation among the inhabitants of the manor. The Lord of the Manor, his officials, and a Manorial court administered the manor and exercised jurisdiction over the peasantry. The Lord levied rents and required the peasantry to work on his personal lands, called a demesne. In medieval times, little land was owned outright. Instead the lord had rights given him by the king and the tenant rented land from the lord. Lords demanded rents, often ruinous, and labor from the tenants, but the tenants had firm user rights to cropland and common land and those rights were passed down from generation to generation. A medieval lord could not evict a tenant nor hire labor to replace him without legal cause. Most tenants likewise were not free without penalty to depart the manor for other locations or occupations. The rise of capitalism and the concept of land as a commodity to be bought and sold led to the demise of the open-field system. The open-field system was gradually replaced over several centuries by private ownership of land, especially after the 15th century in the process known as Enclosure in England. France, Germany, and other northern European countries had systems similar to England, although open fields generally endured longer on the continent. Some elements of the open field system were practiced by early settlers in the New England region of the United States. Description. The dominant characteristic of the open field system was that the arable land belonging to a manor was divided into many long narrow furlongs for cultivation. The fields of cultivated land were unfenced, thus the name ""open field system."" Each tenant of the manor cultivated several strips of land scattered around the manor. The village of Elton, Cambridgeshire is representative of a medieval open field manor in England. The manor, whose Lord was an abbot from a nearby monastery, had 13 ""hides"" of arable land of 6 ""virgates"" each. The acreage of a hide and virgate varied, but at Elton a hide was . A virgate was . Thus, the total of arable land amounted to . The abbot's demense land consisted of three hides plus of meadow and of pasture. The remainder of the land was cultivated by 113 tenants who lived in a village on the manor. Counting spouses, children, and other dependents, plus landless people the total population resident in the manor village was probably 500 to 600. The abbot also owned two water mills for grinding grain, a fulling mill for finishing cloth, and a millpond on the manor. The village contained a church, a manor house, a village green, and the sub-manor of John of Elton, a rich farmer who cultivated one hide of land and had tenants of his own. The tenant's houses lined a road rather than being grouped in a cluster. Some of the village houses were fairly large, long by wide. Others were only long and wide. All were insubstantial and required frequent reconstruction. Most of the tenant's houses had outbuildings and an animal pen with a larger area, called a croft, of about one-half acre (.2 ha), enclosed for a garden and grazing for animals. The tenants on the manor did not have equal holdings of land. About one-half of adults living on a manor had no land at all and had to work for larger landholders for their livelihood. A survey of 104 13th century manors in England found that, among the landholding tenants, 45 percent had less than . To survive they also had to work for larger landowners. Twenty-two percent of tenants had a virgate of land (which varied in size between and and 31 percent had one-half virgate. To rely on the land for a livelihood a tenant family needed at least . The land of a typical manor in England and other countries was subdivided into two or three large fields. Non-arable land was allocated to common pasture land or ""waste"" where the villagers would graze their livestock throughout the year, woodland for pigs and timber, and also some private fenced land (paddocks, orchards and gardens), called ""closes"". The ploughed fields and the meadows were used for livestock grazing when fallowed or after the grain was harvested. One of the two or three fields was fallowed each year to recover soil fertility. The fields were divided into parcels called furlongs. The furlong was further subdivided into long, thin strips of land called selions or ridges. Selions were distributed among the farmers of the village, the manor, and the church. A family might possess about 70 selions totaling about scattered around the fields. The scattered nature of family holdings ensured that families each received a ration of both good and poor land and minimized risk. If some selions were unproductive, others might be productive. Ploughing techniques created a landscape of ridge and furrow, with furrows between ridges dividing individual holdings and aiding drainage. While selions were cultivated by individuals or families, the right of pasture on fallowed fields, land unsuitable for cultivation, and harvested fields was held in common with rules to prevent overgrazing enforced by the community. Crops and production. The typical planting scheme in a three field system was that barley, oats, or legumes would be planted in one field in spring, wheat or rye in the second field in the fall and the third field would be left fallow. The following year the planting in the fields would be rotated. Pasturage was held in common. The tenants pastured their livestock on the fallow field and on the planted fields after harvest. An elaborate set of laws and controls, partly set by the Lord of the Manor and partly by the tenants themselves regulated planting, harvest, and pasturing. Wheat and barley were the most important crops with roughly equal amounts planted on the average in England. Annual wheat production at Battle Abbey in Sussex in the late 14th century ranged from 2.26 to 5.22 seeds harvested for every seed planted, averaging 4.34 seeds harvested for every seed planted. Barley production averaged 4.01 and oats 2.87 seeds harvested for seeds planted. This translates into yields of seven to 17 bushels per acre harvested. Battle Abbey, however, may have been atypical, with better management and soils than typical of demenses in open-field areas. Barley was used in making beer --consumed in large quantities -- and mixed with other grains to produce bread that was a dietary staple for the poorer farmers. Wheat was often sold as a cash crop. Richer people ate bread made of wheat. At Elton in 1286, perhaps typical of that time in England, the tenants harvested about twice as much barley as wheat with lesser amounts of oats, peas, beans, rye, flax, apples and vegetables. The land-holding tenants also had livestock, including sheep, pigs, cattle, horses, oxen, and poultry. Pork was the principal meat eaten; sheep were primarily a cash crop for their wool. Only a few rich land-holders had enough horses and oxen to make up a plowing team of six to eight oxen or horses, so sharing among neighbors was essential. History. Much of the land in the open-field system during medieval times had been cultivated for hundreds of years earlier on Roman estates or by farmers belonging to one of the ethnic groups of Europe. There are hints of a proto-open-field system going back to 98 AD among the Germanic tribes. Germanic and Anglo-Saxon invaders and settlers possibly brought the open-field system to France and England after the 5th century AD. The open field system appears to have developed to maturity between 850 and 1150 AD in England, although documentation is scarce prior to the Doomsday Book of 1086. The open field system was never practiced in all regions and countries in Europe. It was most common in heavily populated and productive agricultural regions. In England, the south-east, notably parts of Essex and Kent, retained a pre-Roman system of farming in small, square, enclosed fields. In much of eastern and western England, fields were similarly either never open, or enclosed earlier. The primary area of open fields was in the lowland areas of England in a broad swath from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire diagonally across England to the south, taking in parts of Norfolk and Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, large areas of the Midlands, and most of south central England. This area was the main grain-growing region (as opposed to pastoral farming) in medieval times. The population in Europe grew in the early centuries of the open field system, doubling in Britain between 1086 and 1300, which required increased agricultural production and more intensive cultivation of farmland. The open field system was generally not practiced in marginal agricultural areas or in hilly and mountainous regions. Open fields were well suited to the dense clay soils common in northwestern Europe. Heavy ploughs were needed to cut through the soil and the ox or horse teams which pulled the ploughs were expensive, and thus both animals and ploughs were often shared by necessity among farm families. The Black Death of 1348-50 killed 30 to 60 percent of Europe's population As a consequence the surviving population had access to larger tracts of empty farmland and wages increased due to a shortage of labor. Richer farmers began to acquire land and remove it from communal usage. An economic recession and low grain prices in fifteenth century England gave a competitive advantage to the production of wool, meat, and milk. The shift away from grain to livestock accelerated enclosure of fields. The steadily increasing number of formerly open fields converted to enclosed (fenced) fields caused social and economic stress among small farmers who lost their access to communal grazing lands. Many tenants were forced off the lands their families may have cultivated for centuries to work for wages in towns and cities. The number of large and middle-sized estates grew in number while small land-holders decreased in number. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, the practice of enclosure (particularly depopulating enclosure) was denounced by the Church and the government, and legislation was drawn up against it. The dispossession of tenants from their land created an ""epidemic of vagrancy"" in England in the late 16th and early 17th century However, the tide of elite opinion began to turn towards support for enclosure, and the rate of enclosure increased in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Controversies and inefficiencies. The open field system is considered by many economists to have been inefficient for agricultural production and resistant to technological innovation. ""Everyone was forced to conform to village norms of cropping, harvesting, and building."" The communal institutions, the manorial court, and the tenants regulated agricultural practices and economic behavior. The manorial lord exercised control over the tenants by extracting rent for land and/or labor to cultivate his demense lands. The scattered holdings of individual farmers increased the time needed to travel to and from fields. The open field system, especially its characteristic of common grazing lands, has often been used as an example by economists to illustrate ""the tragedy of the commons"" and assert that private ownership is a better steward of resources than common or public ownership. ""Tragedy of the commons"" refers to the alleged destruction of common pastures in England as a result of overgrazing, each tenant maximizing his gain by grazing as many animals as possible and ignoring the long-term impact of overgrazing. However, the creator of the term ""tragedy of the commons,"" Garrett Hardin, pointed out that the pastures of England were ""protected from ruin by limiting each tenant to a fixed number of animals."" Thus, Hardin says the commons were ""managed"", the ""logical equivalent of socialism...which may be good or bad depending on the quality of the management."" The fact that the open field system endured for as much as a thousand years and provided a livelihood to a growing population during that period indicates that the quality of management of the commons was often good. The replacement of the open field system by privately owned property was fiercely resisted by many elements of society. The ""brave new world"" of a harsher, more competitive and capitalistic society from the 16th century onward destroyed the securities and certainties of land tenure of the open field system. The system, however, died only slowly. More than one-half the agricultural land of England was still not enclosed in 1700 after which the government discouraged the continuation of the open-field system. It was finally laid to rest in England about 1850 after more than 5,000 acts of Parliament over several centuries had transformed the ""scattered plots in the open fields"" into unambiguous private and enclosed properties free of village and communal control and use.Other European countries also began to pass legislation to eliminate the scattering of farm land, the Netherlands passing laws making land consolidation compulsory in the 1930s and France until the 1950s. In Russia, the open field system, administered by the ""obschina / mir"" (the community of the peasants) remained as the main system of peasant land ownership in Russia until the Stolypin reform process that started in 1905. Modern times. Surviving open fields. One place in England where the open field system continues to be used is the village of Laxton in Nottinghamshire. It is thought that its anomalous survival is due to the inability of two early 19th century landowners to agree on how the land was to be enclosed, thus resulting in the perpetuation of the existing system. The only other surviving medieval open strip field system in England is located in Braunton, North Devon. It is still farmed with due regard to its ancient origins and is conserved by those who recognise its importance although the number of owners has fallen dramatically throughout the years and this has resulted in the amalgamation of some of the strips. There is also a surviving medieval open strip field system in Wales in the township of Laugharne, which is also the last town in the UK with an intact medieval charter. Vestiges of an open field system also persist in the Isle of Axholme, North Lincolnshire, around the villages of Haxey, Epworth and Belton, where long strips, of an average size of half an acre, curve to follow the gently sloping ground and are used for growing vegetables or cereal crops. The boundaries are mostly unmarked, although where several strips have been amalgamated a deep furrow is sometimes used to divide them. The ancient village game of Haxey Hood is played in this open landscape. Allotment gardens. A similar system to open fields survives in the United Kingdom as ""allotment gardens"". In many towns and cities there are areas of land of one or two acres (up to about one hectare) interspersed between the buildings. These areas are usually owned by local authorities, or by allotment associations. Small patches of the land are allocated at a low rent to local individuals or families for growing food. "
wikipedia-200315," Marie-Joseph Angélique  Marie-Josèphe dite Angélique (died June 21, 1734) was the name given by her last owners to a Portuguese-born black slave in New France (later the province of Quebec in Canada). She was tried and convicted of setting fire to her owner's home, burning much of what is now referred to as Old Montreal. Until recently, it was generally accepted that Angélique was guilty of the crime of which she was accused. However, it has recently been argued that she was, in fact, innocent of the crime and convicted more on the basis of her reputation as a rebellious runaway slave, than on the basis of factual evidence. A competing theory is that she was guilty of the crime as an act of justified rebellion against slavery. No consensus has been reached by the modern historical community on Angélique’s guilt or innocence. Regardless of whether Angélique was innocent or guilty, her story provided more insight on the conditions of slavery in Canada. While her life may have indeed been difficult, the testimonies of her day-to-day activities during the trial reveal that she did have some autonomy. For instance, she was allowed to walk around the town on her own. She also interacted frequently with white servants, whose conditions seemed to be no better off than her own. This ""version"" of slavery was very different from that of the Southern United States, as there was no simple dichotomy between black and white. Rather, there only seemed to be different states of ""unfreedom"" which included engagés, servants, apprentices, soldiers, and Panis (Native servants, usually Pawnees). Early life. Circa 1710, Angélique was born in Madeira in Portugal, which was an important player in the lucrative Atlantic slave trade, and was later sold to a Flemish man named Nichus Block or Nicolas Bleeker who brought her to the New World. She lived in New England before being sold in 1725 to an important French businessman from Montreal named François Poulin de Francheville, and after his death in 1733 belonged to his wife Thérèse de Couagne. Slavery in New England and New France was primarily a domestic affair, since unlike the southern part of what would become the United States, the economy was not based on large-scale plantation labour. Angélique therefore worked in the Francheville home in Montreal, and occasionally helped on the family's small farm on the island of Montreal, which was primarily used to produce supplies for Francheville's trading expeditions. Angélique had three children while in Montréal: a boy born in 1731 who lived only one month and twins in 1732, who both died within five months. The father listed in the baptismal records was Jacques César, a black slave from Madagascar who belonged to Ignace Gamelin, a friend of Francheville. It is not known whether Angélique and César were lovers by choice or whether their owners forced them to breed. During the year preceding the fire and the trial, Angélique became involved in a relationship with a white indentured servant, Claude Thibault, who was employed by the Franchevilles. Following the death of Francheville in November 1733, Mme Francheville became occupied with many transactions in the course of operating his businesses and settling his estate. Early in 1734, being occupied with estate affairs in Trois-Rivières, the widow asked her brother-in-law Alexis Monière to keep both her slave and her indentured servant Claude Thibault for her until her return. On February 22, while the widow Francheville was still away, Angélique and Thibault attempted to escape to New England, fleeing across the frozen St. Lawrence river and stopping to retrieve bread that Thibault had hidden in a barn in Longueuil in preparation for their flight. However, the difficulty of winter travel forced the two to take refuge in Châteauguay, near the Chambly road, until the weather improved. They were captured a couple of weeks later and returned to Montreal by three militia captains, acting in their capacity as local police. Thibault was imprisoned on March 5 and only released on April 8, the day before the fire. Angélique visited him several times while he was in jail and brought him food. Angélique was simply returned to Madame de Francheville, who did not have her disciplined in any way for her attempted flight, possibly because she was already planning to sell her. As mentioned during the trial, Thérèse de Francheville found herself unable to control Angélique and intended to accept an offer by one of her deceased husband’s business associates, François-Étienne Cugnet, to purchase her for 600 pounds of gunpowder. The offer was conditional on the widow covering expenses for sending Angélique to Quebec City, where Cugnet lived. Fear of being sold and possibly ending up in the West Indies may have been a factor in the attempted escape. Tensions were high between the slave and her mistress. The widow Francheville dismissed a free servant, Louise Poirier, because of squabbling and disagreements between slave and servant. Angélique promised her that she could do all the work better than Poirier, possibly hoping that a good performance on her part would make her mistress relent and keep her. The widow gave in, but promised Poirier that she would contact her after Angélique had been shipped to Quebec City. After Thibault's release, he visited de Couagne to demand his outstanding wages. She paid them but warned Thibault never to set foot in her house again. Angry, she also confirmed to him that Angélique had in fact been sold and would be shipped to Quebec City as soon as the ice cleared. Thibault ignored the order to stay away and visited Angélique several times while de Couagne was not at home. As this was early April, they both would have known that the St. Lawrence River would soon be passable to ships, and that Angélique would not be in Montreal much longer. Angélique told a servant that she intended to run away again, and it is possible that the two discussed setting a fire to cover their escape. The Fire of April 10, 1734. At seven o'clock on Saturday, April 10, 1734, inhabitants of Montreal were leaving evening prayer when the sentry sounded the alarm, ""Fire!"" A fire had started on the south side of rue Saint-Paul and was spreading east of rue Saint-Joseph. The fire was so intense that the law enforcement officers could not get close to it. Many people tried to take shelter at the Hôtel-Dieu, but due to a strong wind blowing from the west, the fire spread and destroyed the hospital in less than three hours. Forty-five houses were also destroyed, and due to people taking advantage of the general panic, many items were stolen from homes and from the convent. The following journal entry of Sister Véronique Cuillerier illustrates the suddenness of the fire, and the difficulty of trying to control it: ""[...]The 10 April while all was most quiet and our thoughts were far from some fatal mishap, at 7 in the evening during our time of leisure, we heard a cry of fire. In the moment, we all rose to catch sight of its whereabouts. It was sighted at a neighbouring house. We rushed to contain the fire, but the Lord did not allow us to succeed. All took refuge line in our church, thinking that we would be spared, but the flames rose so ardently towards the church, which was just across the street from the burning houses, that we soon found ourselves engulfed."" Rumours began to circulate accusing Angelique of having set the fire; later in the evening, the convent's gardener, Louis Bellefeuille dit LaRuine even told her face-to-face about these rumours, although she denied them. The origin of the rumours seems to have been comments made by Marie-Manon, the young ""panis"" (subcontinent Indian) slave owned by De Couagne's neighbours, the Bérey des Essars, who claimed she had heard Angélique saying that her mistress would not sleep in her house that night. By the time the fire had gone out, popular opinion held that Angélique had set the fire. She was found in the garden of the paupers of the Hôtel-Dieu and taken to the king's gaols to wait for a formal charge to be filed against her. A warrant was also issued later for Thibault, but although he was seen again on the Tuesday morning following the fire (two days later), by the time the bailiffs set out to arrest him he had disappeared and was never seen again in New France. Trial and execution. Angélique was charged and tried. French law at the time allowed a suspect to be arrested based on ""public knowledge"", when the community agreed that a suspect was guilty. Over the next six weeks, the prosecution called a large number of witnesses, none of whom testified to have seen Angélique set the fire, but all of whom claimed they were certain that she had done it. They also testified at length as to Angélique's character as a badly behaved slave who often spoke back to her owners. However, no solid evidence was presented as to her culpability. Frustrated by the lack of sufficient evidence to condemn Angélique, the prosecution contemplated asking for permission to apply torture prior to a definitive judgment, a highly unusual procedure which was rarely allowed in New France. Fortunately for the prosecutor and unfortunately for Angélique, an eyewitness suddenly appeared: the five year old daughter of Alexis Monière, Amable, testified that she had seen Angélique carrying a shovelful of coals up to the attic of the house on the afternoon the fire started This evidence finally allowed the prosecutor to close his case and the judge and the four commissioners he summoned to participate in the sentence all concurred that Angélique was guilty. Beaugrand-Champagne points out that no one questioned why it took so long for Amable to come forward in a city where the fire and the trial would have been widely discussed; she attributes this willingness to credit the little girl's testimony to the fact that too many people had lost too much and a scapegoat was necessary. Recently, some historians have argued that the sentence of the Montreal court was harsh, even given the nature of the offence and the standards of punishment applied in the 18th century. The sentence included the following instructions: ""...And everything Considered, We have Declared the Said accused, Marie Joseph Angelique Sufficiently guilty And Convicted of Having set fire to the house of dame francheville Causing the Burning of a portion of the city. In Reparation for which we have Condemned her to make honourable amends Disrobed, a Noose around her Neck, and carrying In her hands a flaming torch weighing two pounds before the main door and Entrance of the parish Church of This city where She will be taken And Led, by the executioner of the high Court, in a Tumbrel used for garbage, with an Inscription Front And Back, with the word, Incendiary, And there, bare-headed, And On her Knees, will declare that She maliciously set the fire And Caused the Said Burning, for which She repents And Asks Forgiveness from the Crown And Court, and this done, will have her fist Severed On a stake Erected in front of the Said Church. Following which, she will be led by the said Executioner in the same tumbrel to the Public Place to there Be bound to the Stake with iron shackles And Burned alive, her Body then Reduced To Ashes And Cast to the Wind, her Belongings taken And Remanded to the King, the said accused having previously been subjected to torture in the ordinary And Extraordinary ways in order to have her Reveal her Accomplices..."" The sentence was automatically appealed to the Superior Council by the prosecutor, as was required by the Ordinance on criminal procedure of 1670. Angélique was thus sent off to Quebec City where, a week later, the appeals court confirmed their belief in Angélique’s guilt while reducing somewhat the savagery of the trial court’s sentence, so that Angélique was no longer to have her hand cut off or be burnt alive, but rather to be hanged and once dead, her body burned and the ashes scattered. The Council also dispensed with the requirement to have her carried through the town on a rubbish cart wearing a sign declaring her an arsonist. However, the sentence still required her to be tortured to identify her accomplices, the Councillors apparently believing, as did the Montreal court, that Angélique had not acted alone, especially as Thibault had disappeared a couple of days after the fire and never been found. This type of torture was called the ""question préalable"" (torture prior to execution) and aimed at making the convicted criminal confess or denounce any possible accomplices or both. A few days later, the prisoner was back in Montréal, and on June 21, the court proceeded to read the revised sentence to her and prepare her for the ""question"". Angélique steadfastly refused to confess or name any accomplices, even faced with the boot, an instrument of torture consisting of an assemblage of wooden planks bound to the prisoner’s legs. The judge then instructed the Colony’s executioner and “master of torture”, a black slave named Mathieu Leveillé, to apply the ""question ordinaire"" (four strokes of a hammer driving a wedge between the planks, thus applying increasing pressure which gradually crushes the prisoner’s legs). Angélique broke almost immediately and confessed her guilt but still maintained that she had acted alone. The judge ordered the ""question extraordinaire"" (four strokes on an additional wedge, inserted at the ankles) and Angélique, while repeating that she and she alone had set the fire, begged the court to end her misery and hang her. On the afternoon of the same day, Angélique was taken one last time through the streets of Montreal and, after the stop at the church for her ""amende honorable"" mounted a scaffold facing the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the fire and there was hanged, then strangled until dead, her body flung into the fire and the ashes scattered in the wind. Conflicting interpretations. The historiography of Angélique’s story is not extensive, as only a few professional historians have looked at her case until quite recently, and most of the older work dealt with her superficially and rapidly, in a paragraph or page or two, as part of larger works on slavery or crime in New France. The older works all agreed with the opinion of the judges—Angélique set the fire to revenge herself on her owner. However, the first full length non-fictional account of her trial, written by Denyse Beaugrand-Champagne and published in Quebec in French in 2004, was also the first serious study to use all the trial records. The author sets out to present the documents in detail, to question the court proceedings and to present all the possible culprits. She concludes that the fire was most likely accidental, the result of poorly cleaned chimneys and a cook fire in the neighbouring house—a cook fire manned by Marie-Manon, the young ""panis"" slave who was the very person who started the rumours about Angélique having said that her owner would not sleep in her bed. In this interpretation, Marie-Manon, who could have been severely punished by her owners had she been implicated in accidentally causing the fire, had plenty of motivation for diverting suspicion elsewhere. Beaugrand-Champagne believes that the authorities, under pressure by an enraged population looking for a scapegoat for their troubles, took the easy way out and condemned Angélique more on the basis of her independent and outspoken character than on any genuine evidence. Two years later, Afua Cooper published a book on Angélique in English, which champions the thesis that Angélique did start the 1734 fire, as a justified rebellion against her owner and as a cover for an escape attempt. Cooper’s book also spends a great deal of time criticizing white Canadians for what she sees as trying to downplay or deny the reality of slavery in Canada’s past. She claims that the transcript of Angélique’s trial can be seen as the first slave narrative in the New World. A comparative critical review by Evelyn Kolish finds Beaugrand-Champagne’s work to be more trustworthy, while pointing out some serious flaws in Cooper’s methodology. Kolish characterizes Cooper’s book as “un texte qui se situe à mi-chemin entre le roman historique et l’essai journalistique anti-esclavagiste” (a text that is situated halfway between an historical novel and a journalistic anti-slavery essay). No consensus has been reached by the modern historical community on Angélique’s guilt or innocence. Since the prosecution at her trial did not meet their burden of proof, by today’s standards, it is impossible to know for sure whether she was guilty. Fortunately, the exceptional wealth of detail afforded by the trial transcripts, as well as a great deal of important contextual documentation, including both secondary and primary sources, is now readily available to everyone in English translation, on the web, via the pedagogical site The original French manuscripts are available on the website of Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec via the database PISTARD (catalogue code TL4,S1,D4136). Legacy of Marie-Josèphe Angélique. Angélique’s dramatic story has inspired several novels, plays and poems or songs about her. One, the play ""Angélique"" by Lorena Gale, loosely based on an unpublished translation of the trial transcripts by Denyse Beaugrand-Champagne, won the 1995 du Maurier National Playwriting Competition in Canada. Angélique appears almost as a legendary figure, and parts of her story have taken on a life of their own in countries such as Haiti, where, irrespective of documentary evidence, the tale that she was burnt alive with her hand cut off is still told, as if the original sentence had not been reduced. Cooper's book rallies the opinions of other contemporary Black authors, such as the poet George Elliott Clarke, who wrote her preface. Such authors see her as an ""immortal avatar of liberation"" and prefer, naturally, to see her as an active rebel rather than a victim of a miscarriage of justice. Others, like Beaugrand-Champagne, find her just as inspiring as an exceptional, outspoken, independent-minded woman, who fought for her freedom and her life with courage and wit, against formidable odds, and in spite of a society that expected submission from women, especially if they were also black and slaves. In 2012, a public square in Montreal, facing City Hall, was named Place Marie-Josèphe-Angélique. "
wikipedia-8149918," Economy of Kosovo  The economy of Kosovo is a transition economy. Kosovo was the poorest province of the former Yugoslavia with a modern economy only established after a series of federal development subsidies in 1960's and 1970s. During the 1990s abolition of province's autonomous institutions followed by poor economic policies, international sanctions, little access to external trade and finance, and ethnic conflict severely damaged the already-weak economy. Since the declaration of independence of 2008 Kosovo's economy has grown each year, with relatively low effects from the global financial crisis; while there are many weaknesses for its potential in the future, many of them related to its internationally disputed status, there are also potential strengths, including its very low level of government debt and future liabilities and the strength of its banking system (despite remaining obstacles to using this for productive loans). Kosovo remains one of the poorest areas of Europe, with as much as 45% of the population living below the official poverty line, and 17% being extremely poor according to the World Bank.  Developments from 1999. After strong increases in 2000 and 2001, as a result of post-war reconstruction and foreign assistance, growth in GDP was negative in 2002. In the period from 2003 to 2011 it resumed its upward trajectory, despite declining foreign assistance, averaging over 5% a year. It is noteworthy that growth continued during the financial crisis of 2009, and returned to 5% in 2011 Inflation was low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has a negative balance of trade; in 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP, and was 39% of GDP in 2011. Remittances from the Kosovo diaspora accounted for an estimated 14 percent of GDP, little changed over the previous decade.  Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. The private sector which has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak. The economy, and its sources of growth, are therefore geared far more to demand than production, as shown by the current account, which was in 2011 in deficit by about 20% of GDP. Consequently Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora (the majority of these from Germany and Switzerland), FDI (of which a high proportion also comes from the diaspora, and other capital inflows. These taxes are collected at all Tax Collection Points at Kosovo's borders, including that between Kosovo and Serbia. UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed free-trade agreements with Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and the Republic of Macedonia. The euro is the official currency of Kosovo. Kosovo adopted the German mark in 1999 to replace the Serbian dinar, and later replaced it with the euro, although the Serbian dinar is still used in some Serb-majority areas (mostly in the north). This means that Kosovo has no levers of monetary policy over its economy, and must rely on a conservative fiscal policy to provide the means to respond to external shocks. The IMF have pointed out, however, that informal employment is widespread, and the ratio of wages to per capita GDP is the second highest in South-East Europe; the true rate may therefore be lower. The mean wage in 2009 was $2.98 per hour. The dispute over Kosovo's international status, and the interpretation which some non-recognising states place on symbols which may or may not imply sovereignty, continues to impose economic costs on Kosovo. Examples include flight diversions because of a Serbian ban on flights to Kosovo over its territory; loss of revenues because of a lack of a regional dialling code (end-user fees on fixed lines accrue to Serbian Telecoms, while Kosovo has to pay Monaco and Slovenia for use of their regional codes for mobile phone connections; no IBAN code for bank transfers; and no regional Kosovo code for the internet. A major deterrent to foreign manufacturing investment in Kosovo was removed in 2011 when the European Council accepted a Convention allowing Kosovo to be accepted as part of its rules for diagonal cumulative origination, allowing the label of Kosovo origination to goods which have been processed there but originated in a country elsewhere in the Convention. Since 2002 the European Commission has compiled a yearly progress report on Kosovo, evaluating its political and economic situation. For 2008 the European Commission reported a GDP growth of 5.4% – essentially due to public investment (194% growth, compared to a 10.2% decline in private investment) – but the report also noted that the unsatisfactory state of the statistical system does not allow for a comprehensive assessment of the situation. Kosovo became a member of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on 29 June 2009. Foreign direct investment in Kosovo. Leading Countries in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI: from 2007 to 2011)  Germany: € 292 million; United Kingdom: €251 million; Slovenia: €195 million; Austria: €133 million: Switzerland: €115 million; the Netherlands: €109 million, Albania: €70 million, Turkey: €64 million, the United States: €31 million, and France: €5 million.  FDI in Kosovo is still a relatively small contribution to the Kosovo economy, compared with other transition economies. Much of the reason is, apart from a late start in 2000-2001, because of legal and political uncertainties, and an incomplete, contested, and very slow system of privatisation before the declaration of independence in 2008. Thus Kosovo still retains a state-owned telecommunications company, a state-owned electricity monopoly (with the largest lignite reserves in Europe), and a ski-resort in Brezovica (a Serb-majority area) which was the Winter Olympics reserve site during the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. All of these are now under the process of privatisation. Other infrastructure companies (water, railways) may also be privatised. While there remain significant disincentives to investment in Kosovo (a small domestic market, residual political uncertainty, perceptions of corruption, and a slow and uncertain judicicial system), there are also incentives. These include a much younger workforce than elsewhere in south-eastern Europe, which has been more exposed to Western European culture and has higher linguistic standards (see next paragraph); a low corporate tax-rate; access to the EU and CEFTA markets; and a government with low debt and low contingent liabilities in terms of pension and other social welfare transfers. Information and communications technology in Kosovo has also developed very rapidly and broadband internet penetration is comparable to the EU average. In the 2011 census, of Kosovo's enumerated population of 1,739,835, the following numbers claimed to be able to speak languages other than their mother-tongue: Serbian/Bosniac: 303,370 English: 254,474 German: 115,480 Turkish: 49,724 French: 24,487 Energy in Kosovo. Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK) is currently the sole power corporation in the Republic of Kosovo. KEK is vertically integrated and was legally incorporated at the end of 2005. It relies on extensive lignite deposits - 14.7 billion tonnes, the fifth largest in the world, with a relatively high calorific value for lignite, and is currently under a privatisation process. In 2009 demand was met by lignite generation (4,656 GWh), imports (611 GWh) and hydro (121 GWh). In Yugoslav times, Kosovo was a net exporter of electricity. But its current generating capacity has been affected by many factors. The generation units were designed for a life of 30 years but have all operated for longer than 28 years, and in some cases for 50 years. They were part of a much wider integrated energy system in which they could be shut down for maintenance without local economic consequences. Maintenance was reduced in the period from 1989 to 1999; and expert (Albanian) workers were sacked in 1990 and expert (Serb) workers left in 1999. Distribution has also suffered. The Northern (Serb-majority) municipalities have received electricity without any ability by KEK to receive payment, as has also been the case for much of the 1999-2007 period in southern Serb-majority areas. (Many Albanians also avoided their payments at this period). Transmission of electricity through Kosovo from Serbia to Macedonia has not created any income for Kosovo because of the status dispute. Natural Resources. Kosovo is rich in natural resources, and has been an important mining centre for much of its history. In Kosovo there is substantially high reserves of lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron and bauxite. There is also believed to be around 14 billion tonnes of lignite. Canadian company Avrupa Minerals Ltd has achieved the rights to a three year mining programme, which is expected to start in summer 2011. In 2005 the Directorate for Mines and Minerals and the World Bank estimated that Kosovo had €13.5 Billion worth of minerals. However, Kosovo has a high density of population and buildings by South-Eastern European standards, and full exploitation of these resources at an acceptable environmental cost may not be easy. Mineral deposits. Lignite is of outstanding importance in Kosovo. It contributes 97% of the total electricity generation, with just 3% being based on hydropower. At 14,700 Mt, Kosovo possesses the world's fifth-largest proven reserves of lignite. The lignite is distributed across the Kosovo, Dukagjin and Drenica Basins, although mining has so far been restricted to the Kosovo Basin. The first systematic records of lignite exploitation date from 1922, when small-scale, shallow underground room-and-pillar mining commenced in the Kosovo Basin. Large-scale winning of lignite began with the first production from the Mirash (1958) and Bardh (1969) open-pit mines, using bucketwheel excavators. Cumulative exploitation from the commencement of mining in 1922 up to the end of 2004 has amounted to 265 Mt. Geologically, Kosovo's lignite mines exploit one of the most favorable lignite deposits in Europe. The average stripping ratio is 1.7m3 of waste to one tonne of coal and the total estimated economically exploitable resource represents one of the richest in Europe, which would allow ambitious power generation and expansion schemes in forthcoming decades. The lignite is of high quality for the generation of electricity and compares well with the lignite resources of neighbouring countries on a range of parameters. Kosovo's lignite varies in net calorific value (NCV) from 6.28-9.21 MJ/kg, averaging 7.8 MJ/kg. The deposits (Pliocene in age) can be up to 100 m thick, but average 40 m, and possess an average strip ratio of 1.7:1. This combination has meant that the cost of lignite-fuelled electricity in Kosovo is the lowest in the region. Kosovo's cost of €0.62/GJ compares favourably with €0.88/GJ in Bulgaria and €1.34/GJ in Serbia and Montenegro. Further development of lignite mining in the medium term will continue with the exploitation of the Sibovc mining field in the northern part of the Kosovo Basin, and provides a great opportunity for private investors. In what today is Kosovo, base-metal mining has been a mainstay of the economy, since pre-Roman times. Illyrians, Romans, Byzantines, Saxons, Turks, French and Britons have all conducted extensive mining in the region. These activities have been based on a series of nine mines, of which five comprise today's Trepca Complex. Modern mining began in the 1930s, when the British company Selection Trust Ltd revamped the Trepca Complex, including the development of a battery factory that utilised the lead. Active mining of the five mines ceased during the NATO bombing campaign. The locations of the Trepca mines define the Trepca Mineral Belt. There are three NNW-SSE trending zones of mineralisation within this belt that hosts the ore deposits. Zone I includes the Artana (Novo Brdo) mine and follows the boundary between the Vardar Zone and the Kosovo sector of the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, which is characterised by extensive Neogene calc-alkaline volcanics and intrusives. Zone II includes the Belo Brdo, Stan Terg and Hajvalia mines. This zone follows the major fault that marks the eastern margin of the Miocene Pristina basin, and its extension to the NNW and the intrusive and volcanic complexes in northern Kosovo. Zone III includes the Crnac mine, and hosts a number of lead-zinc occurrences along the western border of the Vardar Zone, where it is in contact with the Dinaride Drina-Ivanjica (Drenica) structural block. Current estimates for combined mineable reserves for the five mines have been undertaken, but all of the deposits are open at depth and their strike lengths are uncertain, owing to a lack of systematic exploration and definition drilling. During the lead-zinc-silver exploitation at Farbani Potok (Artana-Novo Brdo), about 3 Mt of high-grade halloysite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) was discovered. This is only one of five known exploitable deposits of this very high-value (US$140–450/t) clay, the other four being in New Zealand, Turkey, China and Utah, US. Current world production is estimated at 150,000 t/y. Former open-pit mining operations based on laterite were undertaken at Çikatova (Dushkaja and Suke) and Gllavica. Remaining mineable reserves have been calculated as 13.2 Mt averaging 1.42% Ni and 0.05% Co. Production stopped in 1999 and has resumed . The buyer of Ferronikeli, IMR/Alferon, paid 33 million euro ($38.76 million) for the plant. The company had to invest at least 20 million euro in the first three years and to employ 1,000 at the end of the first year. Ferronikeli ore mining and metallurgical complex was set up in 1984 to produce ferro-nickel for exports. It produced and exported 6,800 tonnes a year of nickel, in ferro-nickel ingots, before the 1990s but since 1998 it has been idle.Ferronikeli has three open pit mines: the Dushkaja mine with estimated reserves of 6.2 million tones; the Suka mine - 0.8 million tonnes and the Gllavica with 6.8 million tones. Ferronikeli now is one of the main exporters of Kosovo. A chain of Alpine-type chromite pods in southwestern Kosovo are part of a series of linear deposits that continue into Albania. These pods are small but of high grade and in Albania are known to possess enhanced levels of platinum group metals (PGM). From the end of World War Two until 1956, the ores were worked, primarily from the Djakova mine by Deva holding company, and direct-shipping ore was sent to Albania for treatment. When the high-grade ore was depleted, Kosovo began importing 30,000- 50,000 t/y of chromite ore from Albania. This ceased when the plant was closed in 1991. No meaningful exploration for chrome has been undertaken for several decades. Kosovo's bauxite deposits are hosted in karst limestone and have been exploited in a series of pits that comprise the Grebnik mine. The host limestone was worked as a construction material and a sizeable stockpile of broken limestone remains on site. Mining began in 1966 and ceased in 1990, owing to the deteriorating political climate in Kosovo. Total production was 2.85 Mt. The traditional markets for bauxite from Grebnik were Romania, Germany and Russia. The mine had a fines mixing and bagging facility to produce wall plaster; production was 5,000 t/y, for the domestic market, and Montenegro and Macedonia. Kosovo possesses two magnesite (MgCO3) mines at Golesh and Strezovc. Both were originally worked as quarries and both moved to underground operations prior to their closure in 1999.  Before 1990, the Golesh operation produced 110,000 t of magnesite, 22,000 t of sintered magnesia and 10,000 t of caustic calcined magnesia per annum. Golesh mine is accessed via a shaft, whereas Strezovc is accessed via a horizontal adit in the hillside. Both mines have recently been put up for privatisation. For further information on the privatisation process, visit: www.pak-ks.org/ Kosovo is rich in high quality construction minerals, such as andesite, basalt, diabas, gabbro, granite, limestone and marble. [http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/action/switchLanguage.do?activePagePath=/al/mining/minerals.html&language=en] Wines. Wine has always historically produced in Kosovo, both red and white. Currently the wine industry is successful and growing after the war in the 1990s. The main heartland of Kosovo's wine industry is in Orahovac (Rahoveci) where millions of litres of wine is produced. The main wines produced in Kosovo include Pinot noir, Merlot and Chardonnay. Kosovo has recently been exporting wines to Germany and the United States. Trade. Kosovo is a small open economy and mainly imports more goods and services than it exports. It is committed to trade liberalization. Participation in regional and wider trade facilitating mechanisms has been one of the main policy objectives of Kosovo institutions.  Enhancing trade in Kosovo through liberalized trade requires three aspects to be in place, import rationalization and replacement, trade facilitation and export promotion.  This is the UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) integrated export strategy which gives equal importance to competitiveness in the domestic market and competitiveness in the foreign market. Kosovo's largest export market is Italy (averaging an amount of € 84 million), followed by Albania (€ 34 million), Republic of Macedonia (€ 31 million) and Germany(€ 24 million). Imports are mostly from Europian Union and CEFTA countries. Republic of Macedonia is the biggest exporter in Kosovo (with € 366 million) followed by Germany (€ 293 million), Serbia (€ 255 million) and Turkey (€ 184 million). Exports until December 2011 reached € 319 million, dominated by significantly larger imports of € 2.49 billion. This is a 7.8% increase for exports and 15.5% for imports compared with the same period in 2010. The foreign trade shows a net deficit of € 2,17 billion for December 2011, which is increased for 302 million compared to the same period 2010. One of the worst problem faced by Kosovo is the negative trade balance, this is made worse by the high level of informal economic activity and an uncontrolled Black market, lead by illegal groups in northern Kosovo. Exports are dominated mainly by raw materials. Kosovo’s liberal trade regime is characterized by simplicity and neutrality, key features considered to be important for stimulating private sector led growth as well as creating the conditions for healthy exports. But as trade liberalization has not been accompanied by an improvement in the competitiveness of the emerging domestic production sectors, Kosovo is facing a huge trade deficit. In June 2009, Kosovo joined the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and Kosovo began servicing its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt. In order to help integrate Kosovo into regional economic structures, UNMIK signed (on behalf of Kosovo) its accession to the Central Europe Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) in 2006. Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina previously had refused to recognize Kosovo's customs stamp or extend reduced tariff privileges for Kosovo products under CEFTA, but both countries resumed trade with Kosovo in 2011. List of companies. Banks. Commercial banks operating in Kosovo marked their highest profit since their establishment. During 2011, the eight commercial banks operating in the country's financial markets have recorded together a profit of over 37 million Euros. ""ProCredit Bank"" and ""Raiffeisen Bank"" marked the greater percentage from the total profit. The first recorded a profit of 16.8 million Euros, while the ""Raiffeisen"" has recorded a profit of over 12 million Euros.  The total net value of loans granted by commercial banks listed on 31 December 2011 amounted to 1.562 billion Euros. Meanwhile in 2010, the net value of loans granted by commercial banks was 1.335 billion Euros. During 2011, lending increased by 227 million Euros. The value of deposits during 2011 has increased by 100 million Euros, reaching a total of 2.097 billion Euros. [http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&main_id=1218] The United States and Kosovo in September 2012, signed a groundbreaking agricultural development credit scheme worth over €20 million euro. The program is to provide loan guarantees to six Kosovo banks to issue loans to farmers and agricultural businesses, increasing lending to a sector that is constrained by lack of access to credit. [http://www.bqk-kos.org/?cid=1,42] Telecommunications. Kosovo has two GSM 900 MHz networks, both of them with ""foreign"" international prefix, making it quite a unique case in the GSM World market. Because of the still unclear political situation, Kosovo does not have its own international prefix code. So landline numbers still use the +381 Serbian code, while the two mobile operators use +377 Monaco prefix (Vala) and +386 Slovenian one (IPKO). Telenor and Telekom Srbija (Serbian operators) used to have coverage in Pristina and some other little areas of Kosovo, but their towers have been dismantled in the independentist territory, so that GSM coverage is now offered only by the two local operators. In 2009 also the first MVNO appeared in Kosovo. It's called D3 and uses IPKO's Slovenian network. The secondo MVNO, Z Mobile, uses Vala's network and Monaco prefix. There are two virtual operators : GSM-services in Kosovo are provided by Vala, a subsidiary of PTK, and IPKO, a company owned by Slovenian Telecom, which has acquired the second mobile operator license in Kosovo and has started operations in late 2007. Vala has over 850.000 subscribers, mostly using the pre-paid system, whereas IPKO has gained over 300,000 subscribers within just a few months. Based on the report of the TRA, VALA remains the leader in mobile telephony market in Kosovo, taking over 67% of the total, if included Z-mobile virtual operator, which uses the infrastructure VALA network.

wikipedia-881128," Blue Heelers  Blue Heelers is an Australian police drama series which depicted the lives of police officers stationed at the fictional Mount Thomas police station in a small town in Victoria. Overview. ""Blue Heelers"" was produced by Southern Star for the Seven Network. As well as ""everyday"" policing matters, the series dealt with many controversial and ""touchy"" subjects. The series was also the first to examine the stressful world of young police officers who are invariably ""thrown into the deep end where they are left to sink or swim"". During its 13-season run it won a total of 32 awards and was nominated for a further 50. This included 25 Logie Awards, five of which were the Gold Logie, the most coveted television award in Australia. Blue Heelers first aired on 10 September 1993 with the episode ""A Woman's Place"", and last aired on 4 June 2006 with its 510th episode ""One Day More"". proceural It was Australia's most popular television drama , police procedural drama programs were enormously popular in Australia in the 1960's and 1970's, but by the 1980's were replaced by home grown soap operas and mini-series, until Heelers made its debut in 1993, the series drawing more than 2.5 million viewers every week at its peak. It jointly (with ""Homicide"") holds the Australian record for most episodes produced of a weekly prime time drama. It was also almost the longest-running series, however, ""Homicide"" lasted one calendar month longer and, due to five feature-length episodes, had more actual on-air time across the 510 episodes. ""Blue Heelers"" also gained recognition worldwide, particularly in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Canada, where it had a strong following in syndication. Worldwide, ""Blue Heelers"" has been sold to 108 territories. ""Blue Heelers"" launched the careers of many Australian actors such as Lisa McCune, Grant Bowler, Ditch Davey, Rachel Gordon, Tasma Walton, Charlie Clausen and Jane Allsop. While many of these actors are still best known for their character on ""Blue Heelers"", some have gone on to bigger roles. Many major actors of today also called Mount Thomas home, including Hugh Jackman, Charles 'Bud' Tingwell, Peter O'Brien and John Howard. ""Blue Heelers"" veterans actors John Wood and Julie Nihill remained with ""Blue Heelers"" during its entire 12-year run, portraying Senior Sergeant Tom Croydon and publican, Chris Riley respectively (although Croydon is the only character to appear in every single episode of the run). Plot. The series primarily focused on the daily lives of Victorian police officers working at a police station in the semi-rural, fictional town of Mount Thomas. Each episode was presented from the perspective of the officers themselves, as opposed to the criminals and various individuals they dealt with. This was a specific technique that creator Hal McElroy chose to employ. Mount Thomas and police officers—commonly referred to as ""Heelers""—were always active, sorting out the town's many problems. These problems ranged from trivial complaints such as land and fencing disputes, to more serious offences, such as homicides and assaults. The small town was also faced with many other significant occurrences including bank robberies, escaped criminals, police shootings, kidnappings and the acts of many deluded criminals. Of these, one of the more significant events included the bombing of the police station during the show's eleventh season. Whenever overwhelmed, the Heelers would call on the assistance of the police in the nearby, larger town of St. Davids, home of the resident police inspector, Russell Falcon-Price. An antagonist in the series, Falcon-Price often tried to terminate the employment of the Mount Thomas sergeant or to close the entire station. Along with their police work, aspects of the Heelers' personal lives were regularly featured in the series. The most well-known of these plot arcs is the relationship between colleagues Maggie and PJ which ended in Maggie's death; one of the most watched moments on Australian television to this day. The environment of Mount Thomas Police station was like that of a big family where everybody usually got along. However, like all families, there were always disagreements. These were usually settled over a beer at the bar at the Imperial Hotel, where Chris Riley was always ready to listen. Casting. Recurring/semi-regular cast. Each episode featured a range of guest cast members, and over the run of the series hundreds of actors featured in these roles. As well as the main (regular) cast members, a number of well-known Australian actors frequently appeared as either recurring or semi-regular characters. These included Terry Gill as Superintendent Clive Adamson, Neil Pigot as Inspector Russel Falcon-Price, Jeremy Kewley as Mt Thomas journalist Tony Timms, Frankie J. Holden as Snr. Det. Jack Woodley, Catherine Wilkin, Debra Lawrance, Emily Browning, Josh Lawson, along with Suzi Dougherty as Dr. Mel Carter, Peta Doodson as Inspector Monica Draper, Beth Buchanan as Susan Croydon, Michael Isaacs as Clancy Freeman, and the late Reg Evans as Keith Purvis. Many other notable actors also had one-off or recurring guest roles in ""Blue Heelers"" including Shane Bourne, Hugh Jackman, Gerard Kennedy, David Wenham, Marcus Graham, Peter O'Brien, Gary Sweet, Vince Colosimo, Alan Cinis and Alan Dale. Production. On average, 42 episodes of ""Blue Heelers"" were broadcast per year on Australian television, with each episode comprising fifty scenes. One episode was made every week. The scripts were written to a formula which allowed one day for rehearsal, two days on location and two days in the studio. Episodes were shot eight to ten weeks ahead of their scheduled broadcast date. There were 16 episodes in various stages of production at any one time (from the conception of new storylines to post-production). In addition, there were always seven complete episodes waiting to go to air. Apart from the regular cast members, the show employed 4,300 guest actors annually, plus 30 extras every week. A total of 150 people were involved in some way with the show's production each week, including cast members, crew, wardrobe, publicists and writers. Conception and development. ""Blue Heelers"" creator/producer, Hal McElroy, conceived the idea of ""Blue Heelers"" when he heard that an eighteen-year-old friend was planning to become a police officer. Intrigued, he inquired as to why this young boy, fresh out of school, would want to become a police officer, as opposed to the many other opportunities he had open to him. McElroy soon discovered that, at the time, a staggering 60% of Australian police officers were under the age of 26. This, coupled with McElroy's desire to create a country cop show, formed the basis of the programme. When this same young officer left the force only a year later due to the shooting death of his colleague, McElroy was even more intrigued to learn about the very fickle, yet rewarding job of policing the community. McElroy continued his quest by asking ex-police officer Michael Winter to write down what it was like to be a city cop who transferred to a country town. These became the ideas that ""Blue Heelers"" was based around. Michael Winter also conceived the name of the programme by recounting the common names for a country police officer: ""tyre-biters""—referring to the fact that country cops are often involved in car chases—and ""blue heelers""—referring to their blue uniforms and overall similar appearance and persona to a Blue Heeler dog, a protective and intuitive breed of Australian dog. From the time that McElroy's idea was initially conceived, to the time the programme was ready to air, three years passed. During ""Blue Heelers"" early development, two completely different pilots were shot: one depicting the story from the perspective of a police officer and the other from the perspective of a criminal. When these were presented to the Seven Network, the network committed to 13 episodes of the first pilot. The pilot went on to become the official first episode of ""Blue Heelers"", telling the story of a new cop in town, Maggie Doyle, and her beginnings in Mount Thomas. Hal McElroy chose to discard the second pilot, realising it was a fatal mistake to be ""with the criminals as they plotted the crime"". He also conceived his rule that the producers of the show ""couldn't have a camera in a room unless there was a copper there as well"" (a rule shared by long-running UK Police drama ""The Bill""). Hence, the basis of the show being from a police officer's perspective became a firm reality. (The only bending of this rule was with scenes featuring publican Chris; as she was billed with the main cast, she was given the same on-screen ""rules"" as the officers. In early episodes, before she worked at the station, this ""rule"" also applied to Wayne Patterson's wife Roz). Hal McElroy tells his police advisor's opinion: By creating the programme, McElroy and Morphett hoped to close the gap between to police and the public. They hoped to show the human side of the policing and that, like other citizens, police officers have feelings, regrets, aspirations and fears. They also hoped that the show would act as a tribute to the courage of police officers, who risk their lives everyday, never knowing if they'd return home at the end of the day. Filming locations. Only about half of the footage for each episode was shot on location. Most of the scenes, including scenes in the police station and pub, were filmed at the Seven Network studios in Melbourne. Much of the filming on location was carried out in towns such as Williamstown, and the more established parts of Werribee. The scenes of the outside of the Mount Thomas police station were actually filmed at the old, disused Williamstown police station, which was then a private residence. Scenes at Mount Thomas High School were filmed at Williamstown High School. The town of Castlemaine was most often used as the backdrop for Mount Thomas, seen in almost every episode. Although the Blue Heelers' pilot was shot in Castlemaine, the cast and crew very rarely returned there to shoot further episodes; images of Castlemaine were usually just establishing shots. Chris Riley's fictional Imperial Hotel, for example, was actually the real Imperial Hotel in Castlemaine. Mount Thomas' fictional Commercial Hotel was filmed at the Willy Tavern in Williamstown. The second Mount Thomas police station, adopted during the programme's reform of 2004, was filmed at Newport Railway workshops. The Mount Thomas Hospital was filmed at the Werribee Mercy Hospital. Reception. Described by critics before its launch as """"A Country Practice"" meets ""Cop Shop"""", and as ""the contemporary cousin of British cop show, ""Heartbeat"""", ""Blue Heelers"" was not anticipated by critics to become a hugely popular programme. However, it became a hit TV show soon after it began airing. During most of its broadcast, ""Blue Heelers"" was very popular in Australia, regularly attracting up to 2.5 million viewers, and up to 3.5 million viewers at its peak. Throughout the show's broadcast it continually drew a strong audience, regularly appearing among the top-rating prime time programmes on Australian television. Viewership of Blue Heelers never dropped below 1 million viewers. The episodes ""Gold"" and ""Fool's Gold"" (episodes 140 and 141), which aired during the programme's fourth season, were two of the most popular ""Blue Heelers"" episodes. Each drew 2.5 million viewers, considered a huge achievement in 1997. ""Blue Heelers'"" executive producer, Gus Howard believed the show's popularity was due mainly to the quality of the cast. Much of the show's sixth season, as well as the first 10 episodes of its seventh season, were the most watched episodes of the series. These episodes focus of the death of Maggie Doyle (played by Lisa McCune). Maggie's being shot and left for dead during episode 255, ""One More Day"", was ranked by TV Week as the third most memorable moment of a drama series on Australian television. 2004 Revamp: The Station Bombing. After low ratings in 2003 and 2004, the producers and executives of ""Blue Heelers"" realised that there were apparent problems which could potentially lead to the series's downfall. In 2004 ""Blue Heelers"" lost the top ratings spot to ""McLeod's Daughters"". During 2003 and 2004, Australian television drama was also at its ""lowest point in a decade"" and many popular shows were cancelled. As the show remained basically unchanged from its debut, ten years earlier, the production team decided that a revamp was in order. ""Blue Heelers'"" revamp started with a new opening credits to make it feel more modern in the 21st century taking out the acoustic putting in an electric guitar which started in the beginning of season 11 and also a broadcast of a live episode which did not feature Ben Stewart, played by Paul Bishop, who did not appear due to film commitments; the episode was titled ""Reasonable Doubt"", and the producers hoped it would offer a short-term ratings rise and encourage more long-term viewers. Although an immediate success, the live episode did not bring about a sustained increase in ratings. Producers also hoped that a shift in direction, a change of mood and setting, and the addition of four cast members would cement ""Blue Heelers long-term future. They also wanted the show to remain relevant and more accurately reflect today's modern world: The main plot, setting and character changes started in July 2004, with the airing of the episode ""End of Innocence"". In this episode, the main storyline was the bombing of the Mount Thomas police station. The blast killed popular main character Snr. Const. Jo Parrish (Jane Allsop) and recurring cast member Clancy Freeman, and injured the show's main protagonist, Senior Sergeant Croydon. After the bombing it was revealed that Croydon's wife, the Reverend Curtis, was missing. It was later revealed she had been brutally raped and murdered. These events brought about sweeping changes to the mood of not only Croydon, but also the mood of the entire show. The Daily Telegraph television writer Marcus Casey commented, ""Mount Thomas has become a darker, grittier place, the people and cops in it transformed by an invasion of evil"". Consequently, the story changed its focus from the old Mount Thomas police station to the new one that was used until the show's cancellation in 2006. The Seven Network feared that in the modern post-9/11 world, a show about country police was no longer what audiences wanted. Storylines of the proceeding five episodes focused on the bombing of the station and the 4 new main characters: Rachel Gordon as Amy Fox, Geoff Morrell as Mark Jacobs, Samantha Tolj as Kelly O'Rourke and Danny Raco as Joss Peroni. Popular former cast member William McInnes also returned to the show, temporarily reprising his role as Nick Schultz. Producers hoped the new tone of the series, the new younger actors, and McInnes's role reprisal would lure back viewers who had stopped watching the programme. This new style of programme that ""Blue Heelers"" was embracing was a sign of the show trying to keep up with other larger television shows, particularly the ""CSI"" franchise. The revamp of the series resulted in a 25% ratings increase, bringing the series's weekly viewership to 1.6 million people. Critical response after the event was reassuring, and it appeared that critics were approving of the drastic moves by Seven and Southern Star: Cancellation. In the hope that viewing would increase, an 11-episode season in 2006 was commissioned by the Seven Network. However, the ratings spike begun in 2004 was not sufficient for the Seven Network to commit to continuing to produce the show. In January 2006, Seven officially announced that they had cancelled ""Blue Heelers"", but would air a final shortened season of 11 episodes in mid-2006. At the time the show was still drawing 1.2 million viewers per week on average, down from the 3.5 million it was drawing at its peak. The announcement was front-page news on nearly all of Australia's major newspapers including The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney's Daily Telegraph, The Melbourne Herald Sun, The Melbourne Age and Brisbane's Courier Mail. Two different endings were shot for the final episode, which finished filming on 20 December 2005. The first ending wrapped up all the show's storylines, while the second left the show open for another season; the first was version was used. For ""Blue Heelers""' final season in 2006, it was moved from its primetime Wednesday-night timeslot, to a lower rating Saturday-night timeslot. In the Saturday timeslot ""Blue Heelers"" competed with ""The Bill"", a British police drama which had become quite popular in Australia on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Saturday Night AFL Coverage on Fox Footy Channel and Network Ten. This move was slammed by leading cast member, John Wood. ""Blue Heelers"" cancellation may also be related to Seven's AFL broadcast, which saw Seven invest $780m for the 5-year broadcasting rights of the game. Episodes. Seasons generally ran in Australia from early February to late November. Each season generally consisted of 41 to 42 episodes. The eleventh season however, only consisted of 39 episodes, as the Seven Network had gained the rights to televise the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. In total, 510 episodes were aired: 509 hour-long standard episodes and one live episode. The live episode, titled ""Reasonable Doubts"", was filmed to celebrate ""Blue Heelers"" 10th year on the air. To prepare, the cast was given six days to memorise their lines. The final episode of the 13th season aired as a 2-hour tribute. It opened with an introduction from John Wood and concluded with a compilation of ""Blue Heelers"" moments from over its 13-season run. Australian television quiz-show, ""The Weakest Link"", hosted by Cornelia Frances, also aired a ""Blue Heelers"" special episode on 9 August 2001. Cast members John Wood, Neil Pigot, Ditch Davey, Jeremy Kewley, Jane Allsop, Suzi Dougherty, Paul Bishop, Caroline Craig and Peta Doodson took part in this special event. Season 14 Merchandise. A CD Album titled ""Music From Blue Heelers"" was released in 1995. It included the Blue Heelers theme music, plus other songs related to the program, many of them Country songs. The first full ""Blue Heelers"" novel, ""Maggie's Story"", was written by Roger Dunn and released in 1997 by Coronet Books. In August 1998, a second novel, ""Tom's Story"", written by Cassandra Carter was released by Bolinda Publishing. Several episodes of ""Blue Heelers"", including ""In The Gun"" and ""Fair Crack of the Whip"" were released on VHS video cassette format in the later 1990s. DVD releases. Seasons 1–13 of ""Blue Heelers"" have been released on DVD with Season 14 due for release on 2 June 2011. The DVD release is only available in Australia and New Zealand. It is not known if the series will be released on DVD internationally. In November 2005, Paramount Home Entertainment released the ""Blue Heelers—The Complete First Season"" box set in Australia in Region 4 DVD format. This was shortly followed by ""Blue Heelers—The Complete Second Season: Part 1"" and ""Blue Heelers—The Complete Second Season: Part 2"", which were released together in December 2005. However, the ""seasons"", as defined by the DVD releases, are markedly different to the original seasons as they aired on television. It appears that the episodes are being released according to what year the episodes were ""produced"" in, as opposed to the year they aired. For example: ""The Complete First Season"" DVDs contain some episodes from season 1 (1994), while ""The Complete Second Season"" contains the remainder of season 1 (1994) episodes and some from season 2 (1995). In January 2007, Paramount Home Entertainment announced that they would be releasing each already released season of ""Blue Heelers"" as one complete set, rather than in two parts as they had done prior. These new sets, rather than being box sets with special slipcase packaging, were now just both parts, packed in a standard DVD case, packaged together in plastic. Each of these DVD sets now consists of 10 or 11 discs, rather than 5 or 6 each. The new sets were released on 15 February 2007. In July 2009, Southern Star announced that seasons 10 – 13 would be released throughout 2010 and season 14 would be released in early 2011. Awards. In terms of awards, Blue Heelers is regarded as one of the most successful programmes on Australian television. ""Blue Heelers"" has been the recipient of many awards, including 25 Logie Awards, five of which are the prestigious Gold Logie, 3 AFI Television Awards, 3 People's Choice Awards, and 1 AWGIE Awards. ""Blue Heelers"" was nominated for a further twelve Gold Logies. ""Blue Heelers"" has also won multiple Silver Logies, including numerous Most Popular Actor, Most Popular Actress and Most Popular Programme awards, as well as many Outstanding Awards. Many ""Blue Heelers"" cast members have also hosted the Logie Award ceremony. In the 2005 50 Years 50 Shows poll,""Blue Heelers"" was voted 37th greatest show on Australian television and ranked within the top ten dramas. Broadcasting. ""Blue Heelers"" had a strong following not only in Australia, but also worldwide; it has been sold to 108 territories and is shown in over 70 countries. ""Blue Heelers"" originally aired on Tuesday nights at 7:30 pm on the Seven Network, thus it was limited to a PG content level restriction. When the series was hailed as a success it began the transition from this timeslot to the 8:30 pm timeslot on the same day. After the move, writers could explore more diverse storylines, as the show was restricted to an M rating. The third and fourth season premiers aired on Monday nights during the 8:30 pm timeslot, but the show moved back to its original slot before the next episode. In its fifth season, ""Blue Heelers"" moved to the Wednesday night 8:30 pm timeslot, which it occupied for most of its run, until the end of its twelfth season. This move was made to make way for hospital drama ""All Saints"". Starting in 2004, the Seven Network aired ""Blue Heelers"" weekdays at 2:00 pm. All episodes aired with the final episode airing in 2007. This made way for the broadcast of early episodes of ""All Saints"". ""Blue Heelers"" has also screened on Foxtel The Hallmark Channel in Australia in various timeslots. In New Zealand ""Blue Heelers"" screened on TV One in a popular timeslot. However, following the on-screen death of Maggie Doyle, ratings fell, and the show was moved to a 9:30 pm slot on Friday. Following that, the show moved to a late night Thursday slot where the rest of the episodes played out, with the show beginning anywhere between 11:30 pm and midnight. It aired its final episode on TV One on 20 March 2008. Irish broadcaster RTÉ originally began airing ""Blue Heelers"" on Friday afternoons at 4:30 pm. Episodes were only a few months behind the Australian broadcast. The series took a two-year break in 2000, before re-commencing in a five-day-a-week timeslot at 10:30 am in early 2002. The show quickly caught up with the Australian broadcast; resulting in the show being scaled back to the original one episode a week in 2004, and moved to a late night Thursday timeslot typically around 1:00 am. RTÉ commenced broadcasting the final season on 30 May 2008 in a late night Saturday timeslot. RTÉ screened the final episode on 30 November 2008. RTÉ began re-airing Blue Heelers weekly from episode one, commencing on 24 June 2009, usually around 4:00 am Sunday mornings. RTÉ screened all episodes in their original unedited state. The drama proved very popular in Ireland and rated very well. ""Blue Heelers"" aired briefly in the United States of America in the early 2000s on the short-lived cable channel Trio (carried primarily by DirecTV). No episode after number 76 was ever shown in the United States, and when Trio changed their programming in 2004, ""Blue Heelers"" was dropped from the schedule. ""Blue Heelers"" was broadcast on Showcase in Canada, last airing on 15 May 1998. ""Blue Heelers"" is broadcasting on IRIB. All episodes were dubbed in Persian. In Italy ""Blue Heelers"" was broadcast on Italia 7 Gold (now called ""7 Gold""), from the 1st to the 6th season. All episodes were dubbed in Italian. In the United Kingdom the series was broadcast on most stations on the ITV Network. Many companies tended to screen the show as hour-long episodes in the afternoon (occasionally with necessary edits to suit the time slot, usually regarding profanity). Central Television started in February 1995 with a late night 23.40 slot on Mondays before following other regions with a typically 14.20 slot. Central were one of the most consistent region to broadcast ""Blue Heelers"", and 252 episodes aired, stopping at the end of series 6 in 2002. Carlton Television aired Blue Heelers in half-hour episodes originally on Mondays to Wednesdays, starting from 3 January 1995, however the series then switched to airing hour-long episodes; when Blue Heelers began to lose ratings, they reverted to two-part half hour episodes; the final batch of episodes shown in the region were from Season 7 finishing on Wednesday 20 November 2002. Westcountry TelevisionAlso followed the half hour format, from early 1995 until September 2001. ""Blue Heelers"" also aired on Anglia Television, Meridian Television and Channel Television, typically Mondays at 2:20 pm, but some episodes also aired in a morning slot during school holidays, until late 1998.Ulster Television (UTV) began airing ""Blue Heelers"" in early 1995. The show initially screened 3 times a week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons at 1:50 pm. They then moved it to the 2:20 pm slot later in the series. A few episodes also ran at 11:40 pm on Thursday nights, as they were considered unsuitable for daytime viewing. UTV cancelled ""Blue Heelers"" in 1998.Scottish Television began aired hour-long episodes from 1995, airing on Fridays, and then later on Tuesdays from mid 1996, until episode 106, when the series was replaced by Murder She Wrote. The series then reappear on most Saturday afternoon during 1998 until December when the series was dropped.HTV, Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television all chose not to import the show. When the English ITV contractors reformatted as one company in 2002, regionally-run programmes such as ""Blue Heelers"" (which were at different points of the series in each region) disappeared from screens. No ITV region ever screened the series in full. The show also aired on UK cable channel Carlton Select in the late 1990s, first screening the early episodes daily and then in a weekly slot Fridays at 20.00 as episodes became more recent. Episodes to the later part of the 1997 season were shown before the series was dropped. "
wikipedia-10711041," At-risk students  An at-risk student is a student who, by virtue of their circumstances, is statistically more likely than others to fail academically. Those determining the criteria of at-risk status often focus on ethnic minorities, those who are academically disadvantaged, those who are disabled, those who are characterized by low socioeconomic status, and students on a probationary status over past behavioral issues. History and characteristics. The term ""at-risk"" came into use after the 1983 article ""A Nation at Risk"", published by the National Commission on Excellence in Education. The article described United States society as being economically and socially endangered. At-risk students are those students who have been labeled, either officially or unofficially, as being in danger of academic failure. In the U.S., different states define ""at-risk"" differently, so it is difficult to compare the varying state policies on the subject. The National Center for Education Statistics lists the following factors that lead to an ""at-risk"" label for students: Students who are labeled as ""at-risk"" face a number of challenges that other students do not. According to Becky Smerdon's research for the American Institutes for Research, students, especially boys, with low socioeconomic status (and therefore more likely to be labeled ""at-risk"") show feelings of isolation and estrangement in their schools. Educational philosopher Gloria Ladson-Billings claimed in a 2006 speech that the label itself actually contributes to the challenges. Her view is that, ""We cannot saddle these babies at kindergarten with this label and expect them to proudly wear it for the next 13 years, and think, 'Well, gee, I don't know why they aren't doing good.'"" Minority students are much more likely to be labeled ""at-risk"" than white students. In addition, minority students are more likely to be identified as having mental retardation. Drop-out rates are much higher for minorities, and the number of college-bound African American students has plummeted. The problem of ""at-risk"" is not one that affects only the individuals labeled as such. Society as a whole is affected when such a large portion of the population is at-risk. Many of the approaches currently used to remediate at-risk students are attempts at a quick-fix. Such approaches are not a viable way to alleviate the problem that faces society. Remediation. The sooner at-risk students are identified, the more likely that preventative ""remediation"" measures will be effective. Examples of remediation include:  Schools also try to work with parents to help them learn ways to help their at-risk child. Finally, the government is now recognizing that a decline in federal financial support and higher standards have been having a negative impact on at-risk students. Therefore, intervention programs that support struggling school districts and help their at-risk students as well as incentives for school districts that successfully help their at-risk students have been established. At-risk programs. Title I is one of the largest federal programs in K-12 education. funded at more than $26.4 billion in the 2008 school year. The Title I program sends money to school districts based on census counts of children from low-income families and children in several smaller categories, such as foster children, homeless children and those living in correctional institutions. Most schools use the money to hire teachers, purchase supplies, and fund intervention programs to help the at-risk students. Many schools use the Title I program as reading intervention for struggling students. Reading Rockets is another program that supports the needs of at-risk students. "
wikipedia-3150514," Long-Haired Hare  Long-Haired Hare is a 1948 Warner Brothers Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon short released in 1949, directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. In addition to including the homophones ""hair"" and ""hare"", the title is also a pun on ""longhairs"", a characterization of classical music lovers. Nicolai Shutorov provides the singing voice of Giovanni Jones. Plot. Bugs is happily minding his own business, playing a banjo and singing ""A Rainy Night in Rio."" Nearby, an opera singer named Giovanni Jones (his name perhaps a play on that of director Chuck Jones) rehearses ""Largo al Factotum"" from ""The Barber of Seville"". Overhearing Bugs, he absent-mindedly finds himself singing along, and loses his temper over his rehearsal being interrupted in this manner. Giovanni angrily confronts Bugs and breaks the banjo strings and the banjo itself in half, crushing the neck and then slamming the body over Bugs' head. (""Music-hater,"" Bugs incorrectly guesses.) As Giovanni practices again, he hears Bugs singing ""My Gal Is a High-Born Lady"" and playing a harp. He tries to ignore Bugs, but again ends up singing and dancing along. Giovanni angrily confronts Bugs once again. He grabs Bugs by the throat, puts him in the harp, and crushes his neck inside the harp like a vise. (""Also a rabbit-hater,"" Bugs counters.) As Giovanni tries to sing again later, the sound of a Sousaphone seems to come out of his mouth. The sound is coming from Bugs playing ""When Yuba Plays the Rhumba on the Tuba"". Though the rabbit promptly ducks into his hole, Giovanni reaches down into the Sousaphone, pulls him out, ties him by his ears to a tree branch, and yanks him down so that he bounces up and down beneath the branch, bonking his head repeatedly. As Giovanni walks away, an enraged Bugs decides its time for payback, and says his famous line: ""Of course you know, ""this"" means war!"" Bugs exacts his revenge against Giovanni though a series of public humiliations during his concert (seemingly at the Hollywood Bowl). First, Bugs vibrates the roof of the concert hall to disrupt the singer's vocals. Then he hammers it so Giovanni moves across the stage and falls and gets trapped into a tuba. Bugs pulls him out and takes him backstage. Next Bugs sprays Giovanni's throat with ""liquid alum"" which shrinks his head as well his voice. Next, Bugs dresses up as a teenage bobby soxer and asks Giovanni for an autograph, only the pen is a stick of dynamite. After the off-screen explosion, Giovanni steps out to the stage with a singed face and evening wear torn to shreds. He takes a couple of bows and then collapses. During the concert's final act, Bugs poses as the highly respected Leopold Stokowski to take over the conducting duties, even breaking the baton and using his hands instead. Bugs makes Giovanni sing various notes, including a very low note. After accepting brief applause (which is instantly stopped when he raises his hand), Bugs cracks his knuckles, winds up his fists, and conducts Giovanni into holding a singular high G note until Giovanni can hardly endure the strain. His face turns different colors as he squirms and unravels his formal wear. Bugs leaves his glove hovering in the air and steps outside to order a pair of earmuffs which are delivered instantly after Bugs places the order in the mailbox. Bugs returns to the stage to find Giovanni has obeyed the glove and is still singing the high note but is now thrashing about on the floor banging his fists, his face still turning various colors. Finally, the top of the concert hall's shell shatters and tumbles down on top of Giovanni.  For the encore, a roughed-up Giovanni appears out of the rubble to take a bow. Witnessing one last piece of the amphitheater balanced on a steel beam above Giovanni, Bugs again cues the singer to close out his performance with the high note so that the piece falls and crushes him off camera. Satisfied with his victory, Bugs removes his wig and ends the performance by playing the Vaudeville-era four-note tune, ""Good Evening Friends"", on a banjo. Music. The film's musical score includes original music by Carl Stalling, but a significant proportion of the score is pre-existing music, including several operatic pieces. The soundtrack includes Gioachino Rossini's """"Largo al factotum"""" from The Barber of Seville; Arthur Schwartz's """"A Rainy Night in Rio""""; Barney Fagan's """"My Gal is a High-Born Lady""""; Herman Hupfeld's song """"When Yuba Plays the Rumba on the Tuba"""" – played by Bugs on a tuba; Gaetano Donizetti's aria """"Chi Mi Frena In Tal Momento"""" from Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor; Richard Wagner's prelude, 2nd theme from Act III of Lohengrin; Franz von Suppé's overture from Die schöne Galathee; and the melody to ""It's Magic."" This last piece is also used in the cartoon ""Transylvania 6-5000"". The Fagan 1896 song had a racially stereotyped subject and lyrics. The author of the re-written lyrics used in the cartoon might be Carl Stalling or Michael Maltese. The Donizetti piece, actually a sextet, seems to have been a favorite of Warner music arranger Carl Stalling, and is also used in ""Book Revue"" and ""Back Alley Oproar"". Giovanni Jones' singing voice remained uncredited and unknown for many years. It was since revealed to have been provided by baritone Nicolai G. Shutorev (1914-1948). That is noted in the commentary voice-over provided on the DVD. Also noted on the DVD commentary is Bugs Bunny's conducting performance as ""Leopold"", as a send-up of conductor Leopold Stokowski's energetic style, including his shunning the baton: Bugs makes a point of snapping the baton in half and discarding it. As Bugs enters the concert hall wearing a Stokowski-like hairpiece, the orchestra members begin whispering among themselves, ""Leopold! Leopold!"" The DVD commentator also notes that Stokowski conducted many performances at the Hollywood Bowl, where the second half of this film is set. Leopold Stokowski was, at the time, one of the best known conductors in the world, although the most famous film in which he appeared, ""Fantasia"" (1940), was a notable flop that did not earn back its cost until 1970.

wikipedia-455161," Tsūtenkaku  History. The current tower is the second to occupy the site. The original tower, patterned after the Eiffel Tower, was built in 1912, and was connected to the adjacent amusement park, Luna Park, by an aerial cable car. At the time of its construction, its height of 64 meters made it the second tallest structure in Asia. It quickly became one of the most popular locations in the city, drawing visitors from all over the area. The original structure suffered a fire in 1943 which severely damaged it, and rather than repair the structure, it was disassembled and the steel used for the war effort. After the war, citizens lobbied to rebuild the beloved tower. A private company, the ""Tsūtenkaku Kanko Co. Ltd."" was established and Tachū Naitō, Japan's ""Father of Towers"" was selected to design it. The new, eight-sided structure was opened in 1956. On the fifth floor observation deck is enshrined Billiken, the God of Happiness or ""things as they ought to be."" Billiken, a popular American charm doll that came to Japan in about 1910, was enshrined within Luna Park when it opened. When the park closed in 1923, the wooden statue of Billiken went missing. As a part of an effort to revive the tower, a copy of Billiken was made from an old photograph and placed inside the tower in 1979. The statue of Billiken became closely associated with the tower and is a popular symbol of good luck. Each year thousands of visitors place a coin in his donation box and rub the soles of his feet to make their wishes come true. The tower is also famous for its neon lights, which change every few years (they were shut off during the oil crisis of 1974–76). Hitachi has sponsored the tower since 1957, and the light designs usually spell out Hitachi advertisements, although one side of the tower is usually occupied by a public service announcement. "
wikipedia-1915666," Bursary  A bursary is an office for a bursar and his or her staff in a college or school.  In modern English usage, however, the term has become synonymous with monetary awards made by some institutions to individuals or groups of people who cannot afford to pay full fees. According to the ""Good Schools Guide"", a bursary is ""usually for helping out the impoverished but deserving and those fallen on hard times."" According to The Hobsons UK Boarding Schools Guide, numerous independent schools have bursary capability, namely grants from the school to help pay education fees. These are usually awarded after a ""means test"" of family income and are not necessarily dependent on examination performance, although some account of academic ability will be taken. Bursaries may be awarded in addition to scholarships where financial need is demonstrated and the prospective student would otherwise be unable to enter the school. To obtain such a bursary, it is customary for parents to be asked by the school’s bursar to fill in an application form, giving details of their financial circumstances, supported by documentary evidence, including capital assets. The application will be considered by the school in accordance with its bursary policy. The award will often only remain in force until the pupil has sat the next relevant public examination. Most schools will review bursaries annually to ensure that the justification for an award remains. In Britain any award made before GCSE will not necessarily continue to the A-level stage.  There are two types of bursary awarded by institutions (such as universities). The first is a means-tested bursary which is available for all students whose parents earn under a threshold value per annum. It is often given out using a sliding scale, with people at the lowest end of the scale receiving a full bursary and the monetary award decreasing in value with proportion to the parental earnings. The second type of bursary, also known as a ""scholarship"" or ""prize"", is one based on performance. These awards are generally given for good performance in the exams preceding university or college entrance in which the student achieves grades above the standard entry. These can be awarded by the university or, sometimes, by companies. "
wikipedia-184723," Vega 2  Vega 2 (along with Vega 1) is a Soviet space probe part of the Vega program. The spacecraft was a development of the earlier ""Venera"" craft. They were designed by Babakin Space Centre and constructed as 5VK by Lavochkin at Khimki. The craft was powered by twin large solar panels and instruments included an antenna dish, cameras, spectrometer, infrared sounder, magnetometers (MISCHA), and plasma probes. The 4,920 kg craft was launched by a Proton 8K82K rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Kazakh SSR. Both Vega 1 and 2 were three-axis stabilized spacecraft. The spacecraft were equipped with a dual bumper shield for dust protection from Halley's Comet. The Venus mission. The descent module arrived at Venus on 15 June 1985, two days after being released from the Vega 2 flyby probe. The module, a 1500 kg, 240 cm diameter sphere, contained a surface lander and a balloon explorer. The flyby probe performed a gravitational assist maneuver using Venus, and continued its mission to intercept the comet. Lander. The surface lander was identical to that of Vega 1 as well as the previous five ""Venera"" missions. The objective of the probe was the study of the atmosphere and the exposed surface of the planet. The scientific payload included a UV spectrometer, temperature and pressure sensors, a water concentration meter, a gas-phase chromatograph, an X-ray spectrometer, a mass spectrometer, and a surface sampling device. Several of these scientific tools (the UV spectrometer, the mass spectrograph, and the devices to measure pressure and temperature) were developed in collaboration with French scientists. The Vega 2 lander touched down at 03:00:50 UT on 15 June 1985 at around , in the northern region of Aphrodite Terra. The altitude of the touchdown site was 0.1 km above the planetary mean radius. The measured pressure at the landing site was 91 atm and the temperature was 736 K. The surface sample was found to be an anorthosite-troctolite rock, rarely found on Earth, but present in the lunar highlands, leading to the conclusion that the area was probably the oldest explored by any Venera vehicle. It transmitted data from the surface for 56 minutes. Balloon. The Vega 2 Lander/Balloon capsule entered the Venus atmosphere (125 km altitude) at 2:06:04 UT (Earth received time; Moscow time 5:06:04 a.m.) on 15 June 1985 at roughly 11 km/s. At approximately 2:06:19 UT the parachute attached to the landing craft cap opened at an altitude of 64 km. The cap and parachute were released 15 seconds later at 63 km altitude. The balloon package was pulled out of its compartment by parachute 40 seconds later at 61 km altitude, at 7.45 degrees S, 179.8 degrees east. A second parachute opened at an altitude of 55 km, 200 seconds after entry, extracting the furled balloon. The balloon was inflated 100 seconds later at 54 km and the parachute and inflation system were jettisoned. The ballast was jettisoned when the balloon reached roughly 50 km and the balloon floated back to a stable height between 53 and 54 km some 15 to 25 minutes after entry. The mean stable height was 53.6 km, with a pressure of 535 mbar and a temperature of 308-316 K in the middle, most active layer of the Venus three-tiered cloud system. The balloon drifted westward in the zonal wind flow with an average speed of about 66 m/s at nearly constant latitude. The probe crossed the terminator from night to day at 9:10 UT on 16 June after traversing 7400 km. The probe continued to operate in the daytime until the final transmission was received at 00:38 UT on 17 June from 7.5 S, 76.3 E after a total traverse distance of 11,100 km. It is not known how much further the balloon traveled after the final communication. The Halley mission. After their encounters, the Vegas' motherships were redirected by Venus' gravity to intercept Halley's Comet. The spacecraft initiated its encounter on March 7, 1986 by taking 100 photos of the comet from a distance of 14 million kilometers. Vega 2 made its closest approach at 07:20 UT on March 9, 1986 at 8,030 km. The data intensive examination of the comet covered only the three hours around closest approach. They were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus, such as dimensions, shape, temperature and surface properties, as well as to study the structure and dynamics of the coma, the gas composition close to the nucleus, the dust particles' composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus and the cometary-solar wind interaction. During the encounter, Vega 2 took 700 images of the comet, with better resolution than those from the twin Vega 1, partly due to the presence of less dust outside of the coma at the time. Yet Vega 2 recorded an 80% power loss during the encounter as compared to Vega 1's 40%. After further imaging sessions on 10 and 11 March 1986, Vega 2 finished its primary mission. Vega 1 ran out of attitude control propellant on 30 January 1987, and contact with Vega 2 continued until 24 March 1987. Vega 2 is currently in heliocentric orbit. "
wikipedia-1182563," Rolls-Royce Nene  The Rolls-Royce RB.41 Nene was a 1940s British centrifugal compressor turbojet engine. The Nene was essentially an enlarged version of the Rolls-Royce Derwent with the minimal changes needed to deliver 5,000 lbf, making it the most powerful engine of its era. The Nene was Rolls-Royce's third jet engine to enter production, designed and built in an astonishingly short five-month period in 1944, first running on 27 October 1944. It was named after the River Nene in keeping with the company's tradition of naming its jet engines after rivers. The design saw relatively little use in British aircraft designs, being passed over in favour of the axial-flow Avon that followed it. Its only widespread use in Great Britain was in the Hawker Sea Hawk and the Supermarine Attacker. In the US it was built under license as the Pratt & Whitney J42, and it powered the Grumman F9F Panther. Its most widespread use was in the form of the Klimov RD-45, which powered the famous Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15. Design and development. Although based on the ""straight-through"" version of the basic Whittle-style layout, the Nene used a double-sided centrifugal compressor for improved pressure ratio and thus higher thrust. It was during the design of the Nene that Rolls decided to give their engines numbers as well as names, with the Welland and Derwent keeping their original Rover models, B/23 and B/26. It was later decided that these model numbers looked too much like those for bombers, and ""R"" was added to the front, the ""R"" signifying ""Rolls"" and the original Rover ""B"" signifying Barnoldswick. This RB designation scheme continues to this day.  Early airborne tests of the Nene were undertaken in an Avro Lancastrian operated by Rolls-Royce from their Hucknall airfield. The two outboard Rolls-Royce Merlins were replaced by the jet engine. The Nene's first flight however was in a modified Lockheed XP-80 Shooting Star. Service use. The Nene doubled the thrust of the earlier generation engines, with early versions providing about 5,000 lbf (22.2 kN), but remained generally similar in most ways. This should have suggested that it would be widely used in various designs, but the Gloster Meteor proved so successful with its Derwents that the Air Ministry felt there was no pressing need to improve upon it. Instead a series of much more capable designs using the Rolls-Royce Avon were studied, and the Nene generally languished. The Nene was used to power the first civil jet aircraft, a modified Vickers Viking, which flew first on 6 April 1948. Pratt and Whitney was given a licence to produce the Nene as the Pratt & Whitney J42, and it powered the Grumman F9F Panther. Twenty-five were given to the Soviet Union as a gesture of goodwill - with reservation to not use for military purposes - with the agreement of Stafford Cripps. The Soviets reneged on the deal, and reverse engineered the Nene to develop the Klimov RD-45, and a larger version, the Klimov VK-1, which soon appeared in various Soviet fighters including Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15. It was briefly made under licence in Australia for use in the RAAF de Havilland Vampire fighters. It was also built by Orenda in Canada for use in 656 Canadair CT-133 Silver Star aircraft. Engines on display. A sectioned Rolls-Royce Nene is on display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum, RNAS Yeovilton. There is a cutaway Nene II on display at the New England Air Museum "
wikipedia-660591," Non-tariff barriers to trade  Non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs) are trade barriers that restrict imports but are not in the usual form of a tariff. Some common examples of NTB's are anti-dumping measures and countervailing duties, which, although called non-tariff barriers, have the effect of tariffs once they are enacted. Their use has risen sharply after the WTO rules led to a very significant reduction in tariff use. Some non-tariff trade barriers are expressly permitted in very limited circumstances, when they are deemed necessary to protect health, safety, sanitation, or depletable natural resources. In other forms, they are criticized as a means to evade free trade rules such as those of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the European Union (EU), or North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that restrict the use of tariffs. Some of non-tariff barriers are not directly related to foreign economic regulations but nevertheless have a significant impact on foreign-economic activity and foreign trade between countries. Trade between countries is referred to trade in goods, services and factors of production. Non-tariff barriers to trade include import quotas, special licenses, unreasonable standards for the quality of goods, bureaucratic delays at customs, export restrictions, limiting the activities of state trading, export subsidies, countervailing duties, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, rules of origin, etc. Sometimes in this list they include macroeconomic measures affecting trade. Examples of Non-Tariff Barriers to Trade. Non-tariff barriers to trade can be the following: Types of Non-Tariff Barriers. There are several different variants of division of non-tariff barriers. Some scholars divide between internal taxes, administrative barriers, health and sanitary regulations and government procurement policies. Others divide non-tariff barriers into more categories such as specific limitations on trade, customs and administrative entry procedures, standards, government participation in trade, charges on import, and other categories. The first category includes methods to directly import restrictions for protection of certain sectors of national industries: licensing and allocation of import quotas, antidumping and countervailing duties, import deposits, so-called voluntary export restraints, countervailing duties, the system of minimum import prices, etc. Under second category follow methods that are not directly aimed at restricting foreign trade and more related to the administrative bureaucracy, whose actions, however, restrict trade, for example: customs procedures, technical standards and norms, sanitary and veterinary standards, requirements for labeling and packaging, bottling, etc. The third category consists of methods that are not directly aimed at restricting the import or promoting the export, but the effects of which often lead to this result. The non-tariff barriers can include wide variety of restrictions to trade. Here are some example of the popular NTBs. Licenses. The most common instruments of direct regulation of imports (and sometimes export) are licenses and quotas. Almost all industrialized countries apply these non-tariff methods. The license system requires that a state (through specially authorized office) issues permits for foreign trade transactions of import and export commodities included in the lists of licensed merchandises. Product licensing can take many forms and procedures. The main types of licenses are general license that permits unrestricted importation or exportation of goods included in the lists for a certain period of time; and one-time license for a certain product importer (exporter) to import (or export). One-time license indicates a quantity of goods, its cost, its country of origin (or destination), and in some cases also customs point through which import (or export) of goods should be carried out. The use of licensing systems as an instrument for foreign trade regulation is based on a number of international level standards agreements. In particular, these agreements include some provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures, concluded under the GATT (GATT). Quotas. Licensing of foreign trade is closely related to quantitative restrictions – quotas - on imports and exports of certain goods. A quota is a limitation in value or in physical terms, imposed on import and export of certain goods for a certain period of time. This category includes global quotas in respect to specific countries, seasonal quotas, and so-called ""voluntary"" export restraints. Quantitative controls on foreign trade transactions carried out through one-time license. Quantitative restriction on imports and exports is a direct administrative form of government regulation of foreign trade. Licenses and quotas limit the independence of enterprises with a regard to entering foreign markets, narrowing the range of countries, which may be entered into transaction for certain commodities, regulate the number and range of goods permitted for import and export. However, the system of licensing and quota imports and exports, establishing firm control over foreign trade in certain goods, in many cases turns out to be more flexible and effective than economic instruments of foreign trade regulation. This can be explained by the fact, that licensing and quota systems are an important instrument of trade regulation of the vast majority of the world. The consequence of this trade barrier is normally reflected in the consumers’ loss because of higher prices and limited selection of goods as well as in the companies that employ the imported materials in the production process, increasing their costs. An import quota can be unilateral, levied by the country without negotiations with exporting country, and bilateral or multilateral, when it is imposed after negotiations and agreement with exporting country. An export quota is a restricted amount of goods that can leave the country. There are different reasons for imposing of export quota by the country, which can be the guarantee of the supply of the products that are in shortage in the domestic market, manipulation of the prices on the international level, and the control of goods strategically important for the country. In some cases, the importing countries request exporting countries to impose voluntary export restraints. Agreement on a ""voluntary"" export restraint. In the past decade, a widespread practice of concluding agreements on the ""voluntary"" export restrictions and the establishment of import minimum prices imposed by leading Western nations upon weaker in economical or political sense exporters. The specifics of these types of restrictions is the establishment of unconventional techniques when the trade barriers of importing country, are introduced at the border of the exporting and not importing country. Thus, the agreement on ""voluntary"" export restraints is imposed on the exporter under the threat of sanctions to limit the export of certain goods in the importing country. Similarly, the establishment of minimum import prices should be strictly observed by the exporting firms in contracts with the importers of the country that has set such prices. In the case of reduction of export prices below the minimum level, the importing country imposes anti-dumping duty, which could lead to withdrawal from the market. “Voluntary"" export agreements affect trade in textiles, footwear, dairy products, consumer electronics, cars, machine tools, etc. Problems arise when the quotas are distributed between countries because it is necessary to ensure that products from one country are not diverted in violation of quotas set out in second country. Import quotas are not necessarily designed to protect domestic producers. For example, Japan, maintains quotas on many agricultural products it does not produce. Quotas on imports is a leverage when negotiating the sales of Japanese exports, as well as avoiding excessive dependence on any other country in respect of necessary food, supplies of which may decrease in case of bad weather or political conditions. Export quotas can be set in order to provide domestic consumers with sufficient stocks of goods at low prices, to prevent the depletion of natural resources, as well as to increase export prices by restricting supply to foreign markets. Such restrictions (through agreements on various types of goods) allow producing countries to use quotas for such commodities as coffee and oil; as the result, prices for these products increased in importing countries. A quota can be a tariff rate quota, global quota, discriminating quota, and export quota. Embargo. Embargo is a specific type of quotas prohibiting the trade. As well as quotas, embargoes may be imposed on imports or exports of particular goods, regardless of destination, in respect of certain goods supplied to specific countries, or in respect of all goods shipped to certain countries. Although the embargo is usually introduced for political purposes, the consequences, in essence, could be economic. Standards. Standards take a special place among non-tariff barriers. Countries usually impose standards on classification, labeling and testing of products in order to be able to sell domestic products, but also to block sales of products of foreign manufacture. These standards are sometimes entered under the pretext of protecting the safety and health of local populations. Administrative and bureaucratic delays at the entrance. Among the methods of non-tariff regulation should be mentioned administrative and bureaucratic delays at the entrance, which increase uncertainty and the cost of maintaining inventory. Import deposits. Another example of foreign trade regulations is import deposits. Import deposits is a form of deposit, which the importer must pay the bank for a definite period of time (non-interest bearing deposit) in an amount equal to all or part of the cost of imported goods. At the national level, administrative regulation of capital movements is carried out mainly within a framework of bilateral agreements, which include a clear definition of the legal regime, the procedure for the admission of investments and investors. It is determined by mode (fair and equitable, national, most-favored-nation), order of nationalization and compensation, transfer profits and capital repatriation and dispute resolution. Foreign exchange restrictions and foreign exchange controls. Foreign exchange restrictions and foreign exchange controls occupy a special place among the non-tariff regulatory instruments of foreign economic activity. Foreign exchange restrictions constitute the regulation of transactions of residents and nonresidents with currency and other currency values. Also an important part of the mechanism of control of foreign economic activity is the establishment of the national currency against foreign currencies. The transition from tariffs to non-tariff barriers. One of the reasons why industrialized countries have moved from tariffs to NTBs is the fact that developed countries have sources of income other than tariffs. Historically, in the formation of nation-states, governments had to get funding. They received it through the introduction of tariffs. This explains the fact that most developing countries still rely on tariffs as a way to finance their spending. Developed countries can afford not to depend on tariffs, at the same time developing NTBs as a possible way of international trade regulation. The second reason for the transition to NTBs is that these tariffs can be used to support weak industries or compensation of industries, which have been affected negatively by the reduction of tariffs. The third reason for the popularity of NTBs is the ability of interest groups to influence the process in the absence of opportunities to obtain government support for the tariffs. Non-tariff barriers today. With the exception of export subsidies and quotas, NTBs are most similar to the tariffs. Tariffs for goods production were reduced during the eight rounds of negotiations in the WTO and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). After lowering of tariffs, the principle of protectionism demanded the introduction of new NTBs such as technical barriers to trade (TBT). According to statements made at United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2005), the use of NTBs, based on the amount and control of price levels has decreased significantly from 45% in 1994 to 15% in 2004, while use of other NTBs increased from 55% in 1994 to 85% in 2004. Increasing consumer demand for safe and environment friendly products also have had their impact on increasing popularity of TBT. Many NTBs are governed by WTO agreements, which originated in the Uruguay Round (the TBT Agreement, SPS Measures Agreement, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing), as well as GATT articles. NTBs in the field of services have become as important as in the field of usual trade. Most of the NTB can be defined as protectionist measures, unless they are related to difficulties in the market, such as externalities and information asymmetries between consumers and producers of goods. An example of this is safety standards and labeling requirements. The need to protect sensitive to import industries, as well as a wide range of trade restrictions, available to the governments of industrialized countries, forcing them to resort to use the NTB, and putting serious obstacles to international trade and world economic growth. Thus, NTBs can be referred as a new of protection which has replaced tariffs as an old form of protection. "
wikipedia-732744," Club 33  Club 33 is a private club located in the heart of the New Orleans Square section of Disneyland. Officially maintained as a secret feature of the theme park, the entrance of the club is located next to the Blue Bayou Restaurant at ""33 Royal Street"" with the entrance recognizable by an ornate address plate with the number 33 engraved on it. Club 33 members and their guests have exclusive access to the club, which is not open to the public. In addition to beer and wine, Club 33 has a full bar, although patrons must order directly from their server rather than the service bar. Club 33 is the only location within Disneyland to offer alcoholic beverages, although the park has a park-wide liquor license and has set up bars for private events. Admission to Disneyland park is no longer included with a reservation at Club 33. Members receive complimentary access to both Disney parks whenever they are open plus early park admission several days each week. In addition members are entitled to complimentary valet parking at the Grand Californian Hotel and access to the Lilly Belle, the presidential car on the Disneyland Railroad. Club 33 members receive up to six Immediate Fastpasses when they insert their Club 33 membership card into any of the Fastpass kiosks and bypass the stand-by queue. Members are permitted to join the skipper in the wheelhouse of the Mark Twain and the engineers in the engine compartment of the steam trains. Name. Of the many stories regarding the origin of the name of Club 33, two stories are the most prominent. The first and official explanation states Club 33 gets its name solely from its address of 33 Royal street in New Orleans Square at Disneyland. A second and less well known story speculates the name honors there being 33 corporate sponsors at Disneyland in 1966-1967 when the club was being built and opened. Those sponsors are as follows: Origin. When Walt Disney was working with various corporate promoters for his attractions at the 1964–1965 New York World's Fair, he noted the various ""VIP Lounges"" provided as an accommodation for the corporate elite. This gave him the idea that culminated in Club 33. When New Orleans Square was planned, this special area for corporate sponsors and VIPs was included. Disney asked artist Dorothea Redmond to paint renderings and hired Hollywood set director Emil Kuri to decorate the facility. While originally intended for exclusive use by Disneyland's Corporate sponsors and other industry VIPs, when Club 33 opened in May 1967—five months after Disney's death—individual memberships were also offered. As of 2011, there is a 14-year waiting list for new memberships. The membership waiting list was re-opened in May 2012 after being closed for over a decade. Corporate members pay an initiation fee of $27,500, and individual members pay $10,000 in addition to annual dues, which are about $6,100 or $3,500, respectively. Initiation and dues may change annually. Interior. To enter Club 33, a guest must press a buzzer on an intercom concealed by a hidden panel in the doorway. (At one time, a member needed only to insert his membership card in a slot near the buzzer and the door would open. However, this process no longer works.) A receptionist will ask for his name over the intercom and, if access is granted, open the door to a small, ornate lobby. Guests have the option of going to the dining level via an antique-style glass lift or a staircase to the second level which wraps around it. The lift is an exact replica of one Disney saw and fell in love with during a vacation in Paris, but the owner of the original refused to sell. Undaunted, Disney sent a team of engineers to the Parisian hotel to take exact measurements for use in the creation of a replica. A sample of the original finish was taken to ensure faithful reproduction.  The second level has two dining rooms. One room (the Trophy Room) has dark wood paneling; the other room (the Main Dining Room) is more formal but has a lighter environment. Once at the dining level, guests can view antique furniture pieces collected by Lillian Disney. The walls are adorned, in part, with butterflies pinned under glass and hand-painted animation cels from the original ""Fantasia"" film. Walt Disney also handpicked much of the Victorian bric-a-brac in New Orleans antique stores. The club is also furnished with props from Disney films. There is a fully functional glass telephone booth just off the elevator that was used in ""The Happiest Millionaire"" and an ornate walnut table with white marble top that was used in ""Mary Poppins"". A video capture from the film on display atop the table shows actors Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber and David Tomlinson standing immediately to its left. A newly installed bar prepares drinks for members and their guests. A harpsichord which was rumored to have been an antique was in fact custom-built for Lillian Disney specifically for use in Club 33. The underside of the lid features a Renaissance-style art piece that was hand-painted by Disney artists. Elton John and Paul McCartney have each played this harpsichord. Walt Disney also wanted to make use of Audio-Animatronic technology within Club 33. Microphones in overhead lighting fixtures would pick up the sounds of normal conversation while an operator would respond via the characters. Though the system was never fully implemented, it was partially installed and remains so to this day. An Audio-Animatronic vulture is perched in one corner of the club's ""Trophy Room."" The microphones are clearly visible at the bottom of each of the room's lighting fixtures. The animal trophies (Walt inherited them from a friend), for which the room was named, have been removed by Disney family members. Photos of the room with the trophies still installed can be seen on the walls now. In the dining room area one may walk through a door leading to the balcony. The balcony overlooks the water in the New Orleans area of the park. The shows often put on there are also very visible from the balcony. Disneyland guests participating in the ""Walk In Walt's Footsteps"" tour are provided entrance to the lobby of Club 33. The tour guide will provide a brief history of the club and explain some of the artifacts in the lobby. The tour members may be photographed in the lift, but are not allowed access to the upstairs area. Tokyo Disneyland's Club 33. A second Club 33 is located in Tokyo Disneyland. Rather than being located in New Orleans Square, it is located on Center Street off World Bazaar. Members of Disneyland's Club 33 have reciprocal privileges in Tokyo Disneyland's Club 33. "
wikipedia-216188," Toxic waste  Toxic waste is waste material that can cause death, injury or birth defects to living creatures. It spreads quite easily and can contaminate lakes, rivers, and the atmosphere. The term is often used interchangeably with “hazardous waste”, or discarded material that can pose a long-term risk to health or environment. Hazardous wastes are poisonous byproducts of manufacturing, farming, city septic systems, construction, automotive garages, laboratories, hospitals and other industries. The waste may be liquid, solid, or sludge and contain chemicals, heavy metals, radiation, dangerous pathogens, or other toxins. Even households generate hazardous waste from items such as batteries, used computer equipment, and leftover paints or pesticides.  In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the state departments oversee the rules that regulate hazardous waste. The EPA requires that toxic waste be handled with special precautions and be disposed of in designated facilities around the country. Also, many cities in the United States have collection days where household toxic waste is gathered. Some materials that may not be accepted at regular landfills are ammunition, commercially generated waste, explosives/shock sensitive items, hypodermic needles/syringes, medical waste, radioactive materials, and smoke detectors. Health effects. Toxic wastes often contain carcinogens, and exposure to these by some route, such as leakage or evaporation from the storage, causes cancer to appear at increased frequency in exposed individuals. For example, a cluster of the rare blood cancer polycythemia vera was found around a toxic waste dump site in northeast Pennsylvania in 2008. The Human & Ecological Risk Assessment Journal conducted a study which focused on the health of individuals living near municipal landfills to see if it would be as harmful as living near hazardous landfills. They conducted a 7-year study that specifically tested for 18 types of cancers to see if the participants had higher rates than those that don’t live around landfills. They conducted this study in western Massachusetts within a 1-mile radius of the North Hampton Regional Landfill. People encounter these toxins buried in the ground, in stream runoff, in groundwater that supplies drinking water, or in floodwaters, as happened after Hurricane Katrina. Some toxins, such as mercury, persist in the environment and accumulate. As a result of the bioaccumulation of mercury in both freshwater and marine ecosystems, predatory fish are a significant source of mercury in human and animal diets. Handling and disposal. Disposal is the placement of waste into or on the land. Disposal facilities are usually designed to permanently contain the waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants to the environment. The most common hazardous waste disposal practice is placement in a land disposal unit such as a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment unit, or injection well. Land disposal is subject to requirements under EPA’s Land Disposal Restrictions Program. Organic wastes can be destroyed by incineration at high temperatures; however, if the waste contains heavy metals or radioactive isotopes, these must be separated and stored, as they cannot be destroyed. The method of storage will seek to immobilize the toxic components of the waste, possibly through storage in sealed containers, inclusion in a stable medium such as glass or a cement mixture, or burial under an impermeable clay cap. Waste transporters and waste facilities may charge fees; consequently, improper methods of disposal may be used to avoid paying these fees. Where the handling of toxic waste is regulated, the improper disposal of toxic waste may be punishable by fines or prison terms. Burial sites for toxic waste and other contaminated brownfield land may eventually be used as greenspace or redeveloped for commercial or industrial use. History of US toxic waste regulation. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Enforcement. The Act gives the United States Environmental Protection Agency the authority to control the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was followed by the Toxic Substances Control Act, which took effect on January 1, 1977. The Act authorized the EPA to secure information on all new and existing chemical substances, as well as to control any substances that were determined to cause unreasonable risk to public health or the environment. The Superfund Act is another act administered by the EPA. It contains rules about cleaning up toxic waste that was dumped illegally.  There has been a long ongoing battle between communities and environmentalists versus governments and corporations about how strict and how fairly the regulations and laws are written and enforced. That battle began in North Carolina in the late summer of 1979, as EPA's TSCA regulations were being implemented. In North Carolina, 31,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated oil were deliberately dripped in a 3-foot swath along some 240 miles of rural Piedmont highways, creating the largest PCB spills in American history and a public health crisis that would have repercussions for generations to come. The PCB-contaminated material was eventually collected and buried in a landfill in Warren County, but citizens' opposition, including large public demonstrations, exposed the dangers of toxic waste, the fallibility of landfills then in use, and EPA regulations allowing landfills to be built on marginal, but politically acceptable sites. Warren County citizens argued that the toxic waste landfill regulations were based on the fundamental assumption that the EPA's conceptual dry-tomb landfill would contain the toxic waste. This assumption informed the siting of toxic waste landfills and waivers to regulations that were included in EPA's ""Federal Register."" For example, in 1978, the base of a major toxic waste landfill could be no closer than five feet from ground water, but this regulation and others could be waived. The waiver to the regulation concerning the distance between the base of a toxic waste landfill and groundwater allowed the base to be only a foot above ground water if the owner/operator of the facility could demonstrate to the EPA regional administrator that a leachate collection system could be installed and that there would be no hydraulic connection between the base of the landfill and groundwater. Citizens argued that the waivers to the siting regulations were discriminatory mechanisms facilitating the shift from scientific to political considerations concerning the siting decision and that in the South this would mean a discriminatory proliferation of dangerous waste management facilities in poor black and other minority communities. They also argued that the scientific consensus was that permanent containment could not be assured. As resistance to the siting of the PCB landfill in Warren County continued and studies revealed that EPA dry-tomb landfills were failing, EPA stated in its ""Federal Register"" that all landfills would eventually leak and should only be used as a stopgap measure.  Years of research and empirical knowledge of the failures of the Warren County PCB landfill led citizens of Warren County to conclude that the EPA's dry-tomb landfill design and regulations governing the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste were not based on sound science and adequate technology. Citizens concluded also that North Carolina's ""1981 Waste Management Act"" was scientifically and constitutionally unacceptable because it authorized the siting of toxic, hazardous and nuclear waste facilities prior to public hearings, preempted local authority over the siting of the facilities, and authorized the use of force if needed. In the aftermath of the Warren County protests, the 1984 Federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act focused on waste minimization and phasing out land disposal of hazardous waste as well as corrective action for releases of hazardous materials. Other measures included in the 1984 amendments included increased enforcement authority for EPA, more stringent hazardous waste management standards, and a comprehensive underground storage tank program. The disposal of toxic waste continues to be a source of conflict in the U.S. Due to the hazards associated with toxic waste handling and disposal, communities often resist the siting of toxic waste landfills and other waste management facilities; however, determining where and how to dispose of waste is a necessary part of economic and environmental policy-making. Mapping of toxic waste in the United States. TOXMAP is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund and Toxics Release Inventory programs. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) and PubMed, and from other authoritative sources. "
wikipedia-6342605," Irish Girl Guides  The Irish Girl Guides is a Girl Guides organisation in the Republic of Ireland. Together with the Catholic Guides of Ireland, it forms the Council of Irish Guiding Associations. Whereas the Catholic Guides are an all-Ireland body, the Irish Girl Guides are not organised in Northern Ireland, where Girlguiding Ulster, the branch of Girlguiding UK, operates instead. History. As a soldier, the Founder of Scouting and Guiding, Robert Baden-Powell discovered that boys could be trained and used to help in emergencies. He held an experimental camp at Brownsea Island in Dorset in 1907 at which the boys were divided into patrols and trained to be self-reliant. The first big rally for Scouts was held at Crystal Palace outside London in 1909. At this there were 10,000 boys as well as some girls who dressed in a uniform and called themselves ""Girl Scouts"". In 1910 Girl Guides were officially formed with the founder's sister, Agnes Baden-Powell, in charge. A syllabus for girls was drawn up for their training similar to that for the Scouts. Only a year after the Girl Guide Movement was founded the first official company in Ireland was formed, in 1911 in Harold's Cross. Guiding quickly spread to Cork and Wicklow. At this time there was no border between North and South so Guiding was run as one organisation for all Ireland. In 1920 Ireland was partitioned into the Irish Free State (26 counties) and Northern Ireland (6 counties), because of the Government of Ireland Act, and a separate organisation for the Free State was created from the whole, the Irish Free State Girl Guides. Ireland became a separate member of WAGGGS in 1932. In 1938 the name of the organisation was changed to the Irish Girl Guides In July 1993 at the 28th World Conference in Denmark, the Council of Irish Guiding Associations was ratified as a full member of WAGGGS. The Council of Irish Guiding Associations consists of The Irish Girl Guides and the Catholic Guides of Ireland on behalf of their members in the Republic of Ireland. The World Conference was held in Dublin in July 1999. An International Guide Camp known as ""Solas"" was held in Charleville, Co. Cork in July 2002. Another International Camp known as ""Campa Le Cheile"" was held in Tattersalls, Co. Meath in July 2007. The Most recent international Guide Camp: ""Camp 101"" was held in 2012, in Lough Key forest park, Boyle, with visitors from 14 different countries. Age groups. The Irish Girl Guides is divided into the following age groups: Ladybirds. Ladybirds are aged 5-7 and make a two-part promise, which is reflected in their sign which uses only two fingers, unlike the Guide and Brownie sign which uses three. Brownies. Brownies are aged from 6.5 to 11. Their guider-in-charge is called a Brown Owl and her assistant guider a Tawny Owl The girls are divided into sixes, each header by a sixer, for the purpose of many activities. Guides. Guides, aged 10.5 to 15 years, not only enjoy active weekly meetings, but also have the challenge of surviving in the outdoors without their parents! There are heaps of opportunities to earn badges for your favourite pastime and activities range from camping & adventure sports to sleep overs and pyjama hikes. There is a huge international dimension to being a Guide, and girls have many opportunities to go on trips abroad to various camps and events. They also have the opportunity to participate in home hospitality in foreign countries where they can really get to know the culture and way of life in that country. Many foreign groups visit us here in Ireland as well. The Guiding programme gives the Guides an all round education and development. Senior Branch. The Senior Branch of IGG covers the age grouping 14.5 to 26 years of age. This branch incorporates:- older Guides, Ranger Guides, Young Leaders and Young Guiders. Guiding has something important and valuable to offer these young women which can help them to be tomorrow’s leaders in Guiding and wherever else life takes them. Senior Branch offers them the opportunity to experience adventure, enjoy international events, develop self-confidence and grow in independence. "
wikipedia-981546," Astoria–Megler Bridge  The Astoria–Megler Bridge is a steel cantilever through truss bridge that spans the Columbia River between Astoria, Oregon and Point Ellice near Megler, Washington, in the United States. Located from the mouth of the river, the bridge is long and was the last completed segment of U.S. Route 101 between Olympia, Washington, and Los Angeles, California. It is the longest continuous truss bridge in North America. History. Ferry service between Astoria and the Washington side of the Columbia River began in 1926. The Oregon Department of Transportation purchased the ferry service in 1946. This ferry service did not operate during inclement weather and the half-hour travel time caused delays. In order to allow faster and more reliable crossings near the mouth of the river, a bridge was planned. The bridge was built jointly by the Oregon Department of Transportation and Washington State Department of Transportation. Construction on the structure began on November 5, 1962. The concrete piers were cast at Tongue Point, 4 miles (6 km) upriver. The steel structure was built in segments at Vancouver, Washington, 90 miles (145 km) upriver, then barged downstream where hydraulic jacks lifted them into place. On August 27, 1966, with more than 30,000 people in attendance, Governors Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Dan Evans of Washington opened the bridge by cutting a ceremonial ribbon. The cost of the project was $24 million, equivalent to $ today, and was paid for by tolls that were removed on December 24, 1993, more than two years early. Details. The bridge is in length and carries one lane of traffic in each direction. The main span is closest to the Oregon side and measures long. The bridge was built to withstand 150 mph (240 km/h) wind gusts and river speeds of 9 mph (14 km/h). As of 2004, an average of 7,100 vehicles per day use the Astoria–Megler Bridge. Designed by William Adair Bugge (July 10, 1900 - November 14, 1992), construction of the cantilever truss bridge was completed by the DeLong Corporation, the American Bridge Company, and Pomeroy Gerwick. The south end is located at beside what used to be the toll plaza, at the end of a long inclined ramp which goes through a 360° loop while gaining elevation to clear the channel over land. The north end is at and connects directly to SR 401. Since most of the northern portion of the bridge is over non-navigable water, it is low to the water. Repainting the bridge was planned for May 2009 through 2011 and budgeted at $20,000,000 to be shared by the states of Oregon and Washington. However, a four year planned paint stripping and repainting project is planned for March 2012 through December 2016. Pedestrians. Normally, only motor vehicles and bicycles are allowed on the bridge—not pedestrians. However, one day a year, usually in October (in 2012, it is on September 30), the bridge is host to the Great Columbia Crossing. The event uses the 4.1 mile-long (6.6 kilometer) bridge to cross the river. The entire route is 10 kilometers (6.21 miles). Participants are taken by shuttle to the Washington side from where they run or walk to the Astoria side. Motor traffic is allowed to use only one lane (of two lanes) and is advised to expect delays during the two hour race. Popular culture. The bridge itself is featured prominently in the movies ""Short Circuit"", ""Kindergarten Cop"", and ""The Goonies"". It stands in for the doomed fictional Madison Bridge in Irwin Allen's 1979 made-for-TV disaster movie ""The Night the Bridge Fell Down"". "
wikipedia-1346698," Ikonos  IKONOS is a commercial earth observation satellite, and was the first to collect publicly available high-resolution imagery at 1- and 4-meter resolution. It offers multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) imagery. The IKONOS launch was called by John E. Pike “one of the most significant developments in the history of the space age”. IKONOS imagery began being sold on January 1, 2000.  It derived its name from the Greek term ""eikōn"" for image. History. IKONOS was originated under the Lockheed Martin Corporation as the Commercial Remote Sensing System (CRSS) satellite. On April 1994 Lockheed was granted one of the first licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce for commercial satellite high-resolution imagery. On October 25, 1995 partner company Space Imaging received a license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to transmit telemetry from the satellite in the eight-gigahertz Earth Exploration Satellite Services band. Prior to launch, Space Imaging changed the name of the satellite to IKONOS. IKONOS comes from the Greek word for ""image"".  Two satellites were originally planned for operation. The launch of ""IKONOS-1"" in 1999 failed when the payload fairing of the Athena rocket failed to separate, preventing the satellite from reaching orbit. ""IKONOS-2"" was planned for launch in 2000, but was renamed ""IKONOS"" and was launched on September 24, 1999 from Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6) at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The imaging sensors are panchromatic and multispectral. This satellite has a polar, circular, sun-synchronous 681-km orbit and both sensors have a swath width of 11 km. Its weight is 1600 pounds (720 kg).  In November 2000 Lockheed Martin received the ""Best of What's New"" Grand Award in the Aviation & Space category from ""Popular Science"" magazine. Space Imaging was acquired by ORBIMAGE in September 2005. The company was later renamed to GeoEye. Specifications. Spacecraft. IKONOS is a three-axis stabilized spacecraft designed by Lockheed Martin. The design later became known as the LM900 satellite bus system. The satellite's altitude is measured by two star trackers and a sun sensor and controlled by four reaction wheels; location knowledge is provided by a GPS receiver. The design life is seven years; S/C body size=1.83 m × 1.57 m (hexagonal configuration); S/C mass = 817 kg; power = 1.5 kW provided by three solar panels. The LM900 spacecraft is a three-axis stabilized bus that is designed to carry scientific payloads in LEOs. It provides precision pointing on an ultra stable highly agile platform. Payloads for a variety of scientific and remote sensing applications may be accommodated including laser sensors, imagers, radar sensors, electro-optical and astronomical sensors, as well as planetary sensors. The LM900 bus shares a hardware heritage with Iridium, which is the basis for the LM700 bus. Communications. IKONOS conducts telemetry, tracking and control in the 8345.968–8346.032 MHz band (downlink) and 2025–2110 MHz band (uplink). Downlink data carrier operates in the 8025-8345 MHz band. Optics & Detectors. IKONOS has a primary mirror aperture of 0.7 m (2.3 feet), and a folded optical focal length of 10 m (about 33 feet) using 5 mirrors. The main mirror features a honeycomb design to reduce mass. The detectors at the focal plane include a pan-chromatic and a multi-spectral sensor, with 13500 pixels and 3375 pixels respectively (cross-track). Total instrument mass is 171 kg (377 pounds) and it uses 350 watts. Imaging capabilities. Spatial resolution. Spectral Resolution Temporal resolution. The revisit rate for IKONOS is three to five days off-nadir and 144 days for true-nadir. Radiometric resolution. The sensor collects data with a 11-bit (0–2047) sensitivity and are delivered in an unsigned 16-bit (0–65535) data format. From time-to-time the data are rescaled down to 8-bit (0–255) to decrease file size. When this occurs much of the sensitivity of the data needed by remote sensing scientists is lost.

wikipedia-14625595," Housing Act of 1949  The American Housing Act of 1949 (Title V of P.L. 81-171) was a landmark, sweeping expansion of the federal role in mortgage insurance and issuance and the construction of public housing. It was part of President Harry Truman's program of domestic legislation, the Fair Deal.  Provisions. The main elements of the Act included: Creation of the legislation. In the State of the Union address unveiling the Fair Deal, Truman observed that ""Five million families are still living in slums and firetraps. Three million families share their homes with others."" He also presented a policy statement on housing: In Congress, the bill was sponsored by Republican Sen. Robert Taft. Legacy. The Act was of great importance in that it governed the way the immense financial resources of the federal government would shape the growth of American cities in the post-war era. For instance, in one survey of the top ""influences on the postwar American metropolis,"" the FHA's mortgage financing program ranks second and urban renewal programs rank fourth. The law facilitated a rise in homeownership and the building of huge public housing projects that would become fixtures in many American cities. The legislation's legacy is mixed, particularly with regard to the success of the urban renewal and public housing elements. The government fell far short of its goal to build 810,000 units of new public housing by 1955, providing little aid to cities suffering from housing shortages. In fact, because of projects like Lincoln Center, a New York City cultural development including 4400 apartments for which 7000 apartments were torn down, the Act's urban redevelopment programs actually destroyed more housing units than they built. Meanwhile, the massive urban redevelopment efforts prompted by the Act came under fire for poor planning, failings with regard to social equity and fairness, and sometimes corruption (see, e.g., Manhattantown). Urban renewal also came under fire for discriminating against minorities, in that it often resulted in minority-heavy slums being destroyed and replaced with more expensive housing or non-residential public works that were not accommodating to the original inhabitants. The slogan adopted by critics equated ""urban renewal"" with ""Negro removal."" The federal government spent $13.5 billion on urban redevelopment and slum clearance projects between 1953 and 1986. "
wikipedia-24784112," Gocompare.com  Gocompare.com is a British financial services comparison website, established in Wales in 2006. It provides comparison details for vehicle, home and pet insurance, breakdown cover, utilities, financial products, etc. and was the first such site in the UK to differentiate insurance products by the level of cover provided, rather than just listing them according to their price. Since 2009 its adverts have featured a fictional Italian tenor named Gio Compario, (played by Welsh tenor Wynne Evans) which have been voted ""most irritating advertisement"". The company's founder, Hayley Parsons, was awarded an OBE in January 2012. History. Gocompare.com was established in November 2006 and is based in Newport, Wales. The company's founder and chief executive officer is Hayley Parsons, who worked for Admiral Insurance for 14 years, and was formerly head of business development at Confused.com.  It was the first comparison site to focus on features of insurance products rather than just listing prices, which led to the company being invited to become a member of the British Insurance Brokers Association (BIBA). In March 2009, Gocompare.com became the first price comparison site in the UK to compare over 100 different car insurance providers. The company, which is 49% owned by esure, posted a pre-tax profit of £34.7m for 2011, up 15% on the previous year. The company is currently the shorts sponsor of Welsh Football team Cardiff City. Services. Gocompare.com provides a comparison service for vehicle, home and pet insurance, and breakdown cover. It also provides comparison services for travel insurance, gas and electricity, broadband, loans, credit cards, mortgages and other financial products through preferred providers such as Energylinx and Experian. On 14 August 2012, the company launched ""Covered mag"", an online magazine that claims to be ""unlike any other financial publication you've ever read"". Advertising. In June 2009 the company launched an advertising campaign featuring a fictional Italian tenor called Gio Compario, The advertisements feature Gio singing the 'Go Compare' tune in different places such as a coffee shop and was voted as the most irritating advertisement of both 2009 and 2010. In direct response to this reaction, Go Compare deliberately subverted the campaign by running a series of adverts where celebrity guests such as Sue Barker, Stuart Pearce, Ray Mears and Stephen Hawking lined up to ""silence"" the character of Gio Compario. Marketing officer Kevin Hughes said ""It was risky, but a brand has to listen to its customers."" Recent adverts in this campaign have since focused upon Compario giving up on singing and attempt alternative ways to promote the site, including attempting to train a dog to play a piano and launching a line of talking dolls. Awards. The company won the 'One to Watch' category at the Fast Growth Business Awards 2008, with the judges complementing the management team for 'an extremely well-executed business with a clear USP and strong brand'. In September 2009 it achieved the Investors in People award. The company's founder, Hayley Parsons, was winner of the 'Woman in Business' award at the South Wales Chamber of Commerce Business Awards 2009. She also won the ""Western Mail's"" 'Welsh Woman in Innovation Award' in 2008, and the 'Business Leader' category in the Inspire Wales Awards 2010. The awards, which are organised by the Institute of Welsh Affairs, recognise the role that Welsh residents play in encouraging active citizenship and in promoting their communities on a local, regional, national and global scale. In January 2012, Parsons was awarded an OBE for services to the economy. Controversy. In September 2007 the company admitted that, on one occasion, an unlawful breach of privacy had taken place with regard to the passing on of data provided by customers. It said that this was the result of a breach of contract by a sub-contractor, Performance Direct, and stated that it would take immediate action to prevent it happening again. In January 2008 the site was blacklisted for a time by Google due to ""irregular inbound links"". This resulted in its share of search traffic for the term ""car insurance"" reducing from 17.49% to 2.31%. Gocompare.com was blacklisted again in April 2009. "

wikipedia-22279404," Superficial thrombophlebitis  Superficial thrombophlebitis or Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is a thrombosis and inflammation of superficial veins which presents as a painful induration with erythema, often in a linear or branching configuration forming cords. Superficial thrombophlebitis is due to inflammation and/or thrombosis, and less commonly infection of the vein. It is generally a benign, self-limited disorder, however, it can be complicated by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and even pulmonary embolism (PE). Incidence. Some 125,000 cases a year have been reported in the United States, but actual incidence of spontaneous thrombophlebitis is unknown.  A fourfold increased incidence from the third to the eight decade in men and a preponderance among women of approximately 55-70%. The average mean age of affected patients is 60 years. Thrombophlebitis can develop along the arm, back, or neck veins, the leg is by far the most common site. When it occurs in the leg, the great saphenous vein is usually involved, although other locations are possible. Signs and Symptoms. Findings of tenderness, induration, pain and/or erythema along the course of a superficial vein usually establish a clinical diagnosis, especially in patients with known risk factors. In addition, there is often a palpable, sometimes nodular cord, due to thrombus within the affected vein. Persistence of this cord when the extremity is raised suggests the presence of thrombus. Risk Factors. Patient characteristics and predisposing factors for thrombophlebitis nearly mirror those for DVT; thrombophlebitis is a risk factor for the development of DVT, and vice versa. Lower extremity superficial phlebitis is associated with conditions that increase the risk of thrombosis, including abnormalities of coagulation or fibrinolysis, endothelial dysfunction, infection, venous stasis, intravenous therapy and intravenous drug abuse. Diagnosis. Clinical evaluation is the primary diagnostic tool for thrombophlebitis. Patients with thrombophlebitis complain of pain along the affected area. Some report constitutional symptoms such as low grade fever and aches. On physical examination, the skin over the affected vein exhibits erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness. Later in the disease, as induration subsides, erythema gives way to a ruddy or bruised color. Duplex ultrasound identifies the presence, location and extent of venous thrombosis, and can help identify other pathology that may be a source of the patient's complaints. Ultrasound is indicated if superficial phlebitis involves or extends into the proximal one-third of the medial thigh, there is evidence for clinical extension of phlebitis, lower extremity swelling is greater than would be expected from a superficial phlebitis alone or diagnosis of superficial thrombophlebitis in question. Treatment. Treatment with compression stockings should be offered to patients with lower extremity superficial phlebitis, if not contraindicated (e.g., peripheral artery disease). Patients may find them helpful for reducing swelling and pain once the acute inflammation subsides. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are effective in relieving the pain associated with venous inflammation and were found in a randomized trial to significantly decrease extension and/or recurrence of superficial vein thrombosis. Anticoagulation for patients with lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis at increased risk for thromboembolism (affected venous segment of ≥5 cm, in proximity to deep venous system, positive medical risk factors). Treatment with fondaparinux reduces the risk of subsequent venous thromboembolism. Surgery reserved for extension of the clot to within 1 cm of the saphenofemoral junction in patients deemed unreliable for anticoagulation, failure of anticoagulation and patients with intense pain. Surgical therapy with ligation of saphenofemoral junction or stripping of thrombosed superficial veins appears to be associated higher rates of venous thromboembolism compared with treatment with anitcoagulants. Complications. Superficial vein thrombosis extension to the deep vein system and/or recurrence of SVT. Suppurative thrombophlebitis is suspected when erythema extends significantly beyond the margin of the vein and is likely to be associated with significant fever. If suspected, antibiotic treatment, surgical drainage and potentially vein excision are indicated. Venous thromboembolism can occur with superficial vein thrombosis. Estimates of the percentage of patients with SVT who also have DVT vary between 6% and 53%, and symptomatic pulmonary embolism has been reported in 0% to 10% of patients with SVT. "
wikipedia-19191789," Eros  Eros ( or ; , ""Desire""), in Greek mythology, was the Greek god of love. His Roman counterpart was Cupid (""desire""). Some myths make him a primordial god, while in other myths, he is the son of Aphrodite. Cult and depiction. Eros appears in ancient Greek sources under several different guises. In the earliest sources (the cosmogonies, the earliest philosophers, and texts referring to the mystery religions), he is one of the primordial gods involved in the coming into being of the cosmos. But in later sources, Eros is represented as the son of Aphrodite, whose mischievous interventions in the affairs of gods and mortals cause bonds of love to form, often illicitly. Ultimately, in the later satirical poets, he is represented as a blindfolded child, the precursor to the chubby Renaissance Cupid – whereas in early Greek poetry and art, Eros was depicted as an adult male who embodies sexual power. And a profound artist. A cult of Eros existed in pre-classical Greece, but it was much less important than that of Aphrodite. However, in late antiquity, Eros was worshiped by a fertility cult in Thespiae. In Athens, he shared a very popular cult with Aphrodite, and the fourth day of every month was sacred to him. Primordial god. According to Hesiod (c. 700 BC), one of the most ancient of all Greek sources, Eros was a primordial god, that is, he had no parents. He was the fourth god to come into existence, coming after Chaos, Gaia (the Earth), and Tartarus (the Abyss or the Underworld). Homer does not mention Eros. However, Parmenides (c. 400 BC), one of the pre-socratic philosophers, makes Eros the first of all the gods to come into existence. The Orphic and Eleusinian Mysteries featured Eros as a very original god, but not quite primordial, since he was the child of Night (Nyx). Aristophanes (c. 400 BC), influenced by Orphism, relates the birth of Eros and then of the entire human race: At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night (Nyx), Darkness (Erebus), and the Abyss (Tartarus). Earth, the Air and Heaven had no existence. Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Darkness, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Love (Eros) with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in the deep Abyss with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light. Son of Aphrodite. addresses Athena: “We must have a word with Aphrodite. Let us go together and ask her to persuade her boy , if that is possible, to loose an arrow at Aeetes’ daughter, Medea of the many spells, and make her fall in love with Jason . . .” (Apollonius of Rhodes, ""Argonautica"" 3. 25 ff – a Greek epic of the 3rd century B.C.) ""He smites maids’ breasts with unknown heat, and bids the very gods leave heaven and dwell on earth in borrowed forms."" (Seneca, ""Phaedra"" 290 ff) ""Once, when Venus’ son aka Eros was kissing her, his quiver dangling down, a jutting arrow, unbeknown, had grazed her breast. She pushed the boy away. In fact the wound was deeper than it seemed, though unperceived at first. she became enraptured by the beauty of a man ."" (Ovid, ""Metamorphoses"" 10. 525 ff) ""Eros drove Dionysos mad for the girl with the delicious wound of his arrow, then curving his wings flew lightly to Olympus. And the god roamed over the hills scourged with a greater fire.” (Nonnus, ""Dionysiaca"" 48. 470 ff – a Greek epic of the 5th century AD) Eros and Psyche. The story of Eros and Psyche has a longstanding tradition as a folktale of the ancient Greco-Roman world long before it was committed to literature in Apuleius' Latin novel, ""The Golden Ass"". The novel itself is written in a picaresque Roman style, yet Psyche retains her Greek name. Eros and Aphrodite are called by their Latin names (Cupid and Venus), and Cupid is depicted as a young adult, rather than a child. The story tells of the struggle for love and trust between Eros and Psyche. Aphrodite was jealous of the beauty of mortal princess Psyche, as men were leaving her altars barren to worship a mere human woman instead, and so she commanded her son Eros, the god of love, to cause Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest creature on earth. But instead, Eros falls in love with Psyche himself and spirits her away to his home. Their fragile peace is ruined by a visit from Psyche's jealous sisters, who cause Psyche to betray the trust of her husband. Wounded, Eros leaves his wife, and Psyche wanders the Earth, looking for her lost love. Eventually she approaches Aphrodite and asks for her help. Aphrodite imposes a series of difficult tasks on Psyche, which she is able to achieve by means of supernatural assistance. After successfully completing these tasks, Aphrodite relents and Psyche becomes immortal to live alongside her husband Eros. Together they had a daughter, Voluptas or Hedone (meaning physical pleasure, bliss).  In Greek mythology, Psyche was the deification of the human soul. She was portrayed in ancient mosaics as a goddess with butterfly wings (because psyche was also the Ancient Greek word for 'butterfly'). The Greek word psyche literally means ""soul, spirit, breath, life or animating force"". "
wikipedia-1258721," Binyamin Ben-Eliezer  Binyamin Fuad Ben-Eliezer (, , born 12 February 1936) is an Israeli politician and former military officer of Iraqi origin. He currently serves as a member of the Knesset for the Labor Party, and has held several ministerial posts, including Minister of Industry, Trade and Labour, Minister of Defense, Deputy Prime Minister. Biography. Born in Basra in southern Iraq, as Fuad, Son of Saleh and Farha. Ben-Eliezer made aliyah to Israel in 1950, hebraizing his First name to Binyamin. He entered the Israel Defense Forces in 1954, and became a career soldier. He served as a Commander in the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, and was wounded in the War of Attrition. In 1977, he was appointed First Commanding Officer in Southern Lebanon, serving as the army liaison between the Lebanese Christian militias and Israel. He was Military Governor of Judea and Samaria (1978–81) and was Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories from 1983 until 1984. He completed his military service with the rank of Brigadier General. He was first elected to the Knesset in 1984 on the Yahad list, which merged into the Alignment during his first term. He was re-elected in 1988 and 1992, by which time the Alignment had become the Labor Party. On 13 July 1992 he was appointed Minister of Housing and Construction in Yitzhak Rabin's government. He retained his seat in the 1996 elections, but lost his place in the cabinet as Labor went into opposition. Following Ehud Barak's victory in the 1999 Prime Minister election, Ben-Eliezer returned to the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Communications. From 11 October 2000 until 3 March 2001 he also served as Minister of Housing and Construction. After Ariel Sharon's victory in the special election for Prime Minister in 2001, Ben-Eliezer was appointed Minister of Defense in the national unity government, and served as Labor Party leader following Barak's resignation until Amram Mitzna was elected in 2002. He left the post on 2 October 2002 when Labor withdrew from the coalition. Re-elected again in 2003, Ben-Eliezer served as Minister of National Infrastructure from 10 January 2005 until 23 November, when Labor left the government. In the Labor Party leadership election on 9 November 2005, he came third with 16.8% of the vote, behind Amir Peretz and Shimon Peres. He retained his seat again in the 2006 elections, and was appointed Minister of National Infrastructure in Ehud Olmert's government.  In March 2007, Ben-Eliezer was forced to cancel a trip to Egypt after being warned by Egyptian intelligence that he could be arrested, when Egyptian media and opposition implicated him in the 'massacre' of 250 Egyptian POWs during the Six-Day War following an Israeli documentary. However, the allegations are disputed by both Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and the documentary film-maker Ron Edelist. Placed eighth on the party's list, he was re-elected again in the 2009 elections and appointed Minister of Industry, Trade and Labour. He resigned from the cabinet after Ehud Barak left the Labor Party to establish Independence in January 2011. Ben-Eliezer is considered a hawk on foreign policy and was one of the main architects of the invasion of Lebanon as well as a strong proponent for Operation Defensive Shield. He advocated halting peace talks with Palestinians until there was an end to violence against Israelis, although he believed once their leadership is able to put a stop to ""terrorism"" and abandon it as a political tool there should be ""compromise"" in final status talks with the Palestinian Authority.  He lives in Rishon LeZion and is married with five children. Some of his granddaughters live in the United States of America. He is fluent in Hebrew, Arabic and English. He contracted pneumonia in March 2011 and was put into a medically induced coma. Ben-Eliezer warned in 2012: ""So far Palestinians have kept quiet, but one day they will awake and the explosion will happen. People don't accept under military rule for 50 years."" "
wikipedia-2153207," The Triumph of Steel  The Triumph of Steel is the seventh album by heavy metal band Manowar, released in 1992. It is the only Manowar album to feature guitarist David Shankle and drummer Kenny Earl ""Rhino"" Edwards. Cover art by Ken Kelly. Album content. ""Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts"" is the longest (28 minutes and 38 seconds) and most complex Manowar song, and probably an anticipation of a concept album that was never accomplished. Because of its Homeric content, ""Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts"" has recently attracted the attention of a group of scholars at Bologna University in Italy. Mrs. Eleonora Cavallini, Professor in Classics, has written about this song: ""Joey DeMaio’s lyrics imply a careful and scrupulous reading of the ""Iliad"". The songwriter has focused his attention essentially on the crucial fight between Hector and Achilles, has paraphrased some passages of the poem adapting them to the melodic structure with a certain fluency and partly reinterpreting them, but never altering or upsetting Homer’s storyline. The purpose of the lyrics (and of the music as well) is to evoke some characteristic Homeric sceneries: the raging storm of the battle, the barbaric, ferocious exultance of the winner, the grief and anguish of the warrior who feels death impending over him. The whole action hinges upon Hector and Achilles, who are represented as specular characters, divided by an irreducible hatred and yet destined to share a similar destiny. Both are caught in the moment of the greatest exaltation, as they savagely rejoice for the blood of their killed enemies, but also in the one of the extreme pain, when the daemon of war finally pounces on them. Furthermore, differently than in the irreverent and iconoclastic movie ""Troy"", in ""Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts"", the divine is a constant and ineluctable presence, determining human destinies with inscrutable and steely will, and, despite the generic reference to 'the gods', the real master of human lives is Zeus, the only God to whom both Hector and Achilles address their prayers"" Track listing. All songs written by Joey DeMaio except where noted. "
wikipedia-2771378," Hantzsch pyridine synthesis  The Hantzsch pyridine synthesis or Hantzsch dihydropyridine synthesis is a multi-component organic reaction between an aldehyde such as formaldehyde, 2 equivalents of a β-keto ester such as ethyl acetoacetate and a nitrogen donor such as ammonium acetate or ammonia. The initial reaction product is a dihydropyridine which can be oxidized in a subsequent step to a pyridine. The driving force for this second reaction step is aromatization. This reaction was reported in 1881 by Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch.  A 1,4-dihydropyridine dicarboxylate is also called a 1,4-DHP compound or a Hantzsch compound. These compounds are an important class of calcium channel blockers and as such commercialized in for instance nifedipine, amlodipine or nimodipine. The reaction has been demonstrated to proceed in water as reaction solvent and with direct aromatization by ferric chloride or potassium permanganate in a one-pot synthesis. The Hantzsch dihydropyridine synthesis is found to benefit from microwave chemistry. Knoevenagel–Fries modification. The Knoevenagel–Fries modification allows for the synthesis of unsymmetrical pyridine compounds. "
wikipedia-8422996," Bluespotted stingray  The bluespotted stingray (""Neotrygon kuhlii"") or Kuhl's stingray, is a species of stingray of the Dasyatidae family. It is light green with blue spots. Its disk width hovers around . It is popular in aquaria but usually not distinguished from the bluespotted ribbontail ray. The ribbontail is rounder with brighter blue and more vivid spots, but the bluespotted stingray is larger. The stingray's maximum age estimate is from one to eighteen years of age. The bluespotted stingray preys on many fish and small mollusks, but is also preyed on by the killer whale and hammer head shark. The bluespotted stingray is also generally found in Indonesia to Japan, and south to Northern Australia. The bluespotted stingray is also targeted by many parasites such as tapeworms, flatworms, and flukes. Taxonomy. The bluespotted stingray was discovered by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species is greatly debatable due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, there are two different subgroups: the Java and Bali form. The distinct difference between the two strains is their size, with the Bali being much larger than the Java. On the familial level, the family Dasyatidae is made up of 9 genera and 70 species. The genus of ""Neotrygon"" are called maskrays, because of the color pattern around their eyes. The largest species of this family can grow up to . Description and behavior. The bluespotted stingray has a flat disc-like oval body in about in diameter and in length; and their coloring is a dark green with blue spots with a light white underbelly also known as countershading. The bluespotted stingray's snout is very short and broadly angular along with its angular disc. The rays' bright coloration serves as a warning for its venomous spines. The ray has a very long tail accommodating two venomous spines on the base of the tail. The tail is about twice as long as the body of the ray, and the barbs or spines are two different sizes, one being very large and the other a medium-sized barb. The bluespotted stingray has bright yellow eyes, and the eyes are positioned to allow them a wide angle of view. The spiracles, which allow them to breathe, are located directly behind the ray's eyes. The ray's gills and mouth are found on the underside of the body. The ray normally lives alone or in small groups. One unique characteristic of the bluespotted stingray is that they rarely bury themselves in the sand only to hide from predators, unlike the majority of rays who bury themselves regularly. Diet. This type of ray feeds on shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, crabs and other worms. Due to the fact that this ray is a shallow bottom feeder, it has a small variety of marine life to prey on. The bluespotted stingray overpowers its prey by pinning them to the bottom of the seafloor with its fins. This ray does not have teeth, instead it has food-crushing plates on the sides of its mouth. Reproduction. The bluespotted stingray is ovoviviparous. The embryos are retained in eggs within the mother's body until they are ready to hatch. The embryos receive nourishment from the mothers' uterine fluid. Mothers give birth to up to seven pups per litter; these pups range from to long at birth. The bluespotted stingray passes its offspring 32 sets of chromosomes. The mother also has an annual reproductive cycle. Studies show that the mating season is in October and November and the ovulating season is in the Australian summer (December 1- February 28/29), which coincides with the embryonic development. Habitat. The bluespotted stingray is commonly found in waters of depths about 0–90 meters (0–295 feet), being found near rocky coral reefs. This stingray is found in a tropical climate at 29°N- 31°S, and 20°E- 171°W. At high tide the bluespotted stingray moves out into the shallow lagoons and reef flats. It is found in northern Australia, Kenya, Madagascar, The island of Mauritius, Somalia, the east coast of South Africa, India. The bluespotted stingray is in almost the entire continental waters of Asia, including the Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Philippine Sea, Sulu Sea, Java Sea, Banda Sea, Celebes Sea, Andaman Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Threats and protected areas. In Queensland, Australia there are many areas for high protection of the bluespotted stingray, three being the Shoalwater, Corio Bay's Area Ramsar Site, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. A major threat of the bluespotted stingray is the destruction of coral reefs mainly in the Western Pacific. The rays dwell in these reefs and the destruction and pollution from fertilizers and pesticides hurt them. The ray is commonly caught in the Java Sea by fisherman trawling and by Danish seine boats in large quantities. The bluespotted stingray is the second most significant species out of the sharks, rays, and skate family to be fished, contributing to about per boat in 2006-2007. Predators. The hammerhead shark frequently preys on the bluespotted stingray... Also the killer whale is a threat, generally preying on juvenile rays. The rays coloration is a warning for the highly poisonous barbs, thus few animals attempt to overpower this ray. The hammerhead shark uses its head to pin down the bluespotted stingray, while it is in shock and much weaker. When a killer whale encounters a stingray they dig them up from the sand, then launch them into the air. Another strategy for subduing the ray involves the whale turning upside down, then biting the ray and flipping over, putting the stingray belly up and causing it to enter tonic immobility. Human interaction. Due to the unique characteristics of this ray it is very common to be found in pet trade, many people ignore the fact that in total maturity the size of the ray exceeds the capacity of many household aquariums. The bluespotted stingray is generally fished for its meat, being either smoked and salted or dried for local markets. It is caught in mass in bottom trawl, trammel, and fish traps. It is fished for its meat, but inexpensive due to small size. The bluespotted stingray is very venomous and it has a barb approximately long. The venom contains serotonin, 5' nucleotidase, and phosphodiesterase. Parasites. There are many parasites that inhibit the bluespotted stingray, this is a table of the common groups of the parasite, and the specific name of the parasite. "
